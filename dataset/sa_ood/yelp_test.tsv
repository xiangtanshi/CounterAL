Positive	"Atmosphere nice, service great, food ""O WHAT A FLAVOR"" All I can say is on point perfection! Bone in PRIME! Pairing menu was precise and to the Tee. Golden Experience. Bit pricey but probably worth it!   Will return next time I'm in town..."
Positive	"BEST BAO I'VE EVER HAD!!!
Exceeds expectations! 

The sang ji bao is sooooo yummyyyyyyy! n.n 
The soup is savoury, the meat is juicy, and the bao itself is seasoned perfectly! Not to mention the slight crunchy char of being pan-fried! 

I'll be sure to come back and order 5 orders for just myself LOL. Each order comes with 4 of these yummy bao. ;)

I've been hesitant to try this place for awhile, but I had absolutely no reason to be!

My companion and I ordered 1 large beef brisket noodle with regular flat noodles and 1 large classic beef noodle with thin flat noodles.

*note: the thin noodles are more regular sized than the regular noodles. the regular noodles are a little too thick and hard to pickup with chopsticks.

The broth is savoury paired with delicious hand-pulled noodles (only issue is a lot of my noodles were stuck together making it difficult to eat). The beef brisket is delicious and packed with flavour!! I highly recommend it!

We also got the eggplant. It's not too special...they burnt the skin which made it hard to remove the contents.

TRY THE BAO! MUST TRY THE BAO!!"
Positive	I will absolutely return - I had been meaning to check out St. Francis for a while now. The server was very helpful in navigating and suggesting items on the menu and the wine list. The goat cheese appetizer was lovely... main meal was delightful and the local dessert was heaven. The noise in the busy restaurant wasn't too loud, so I was able to carry on a conversation with my date. Just like I mentioned in my opening - I will absolutely return, what a great find on Camelback!
Positive	It was a good show but i liked Ka better.  Mystere doesn't have a story line to follow.  There are no bad seats here.  Even if you are sitting in a higher up section, the theater is small so those seats have a good view.  Overall, i liked it and would recommend it but it's not my favorite Cirque show in Vegas.
Positive	VERY GOOD FOOD , Excellent Pepperoni pizza , descent amount of cheese, excellent tomato sauce. Pricie but its worth the money. I recommend  this pizza place to everyone that love pizza.
Positive	"On Friday 4/15/16, I gave Queen City Master Services a call after seeing the outstanding reviews on the Yelp app. They were there at my house the next day to clean my carpets. Now I have not had my carpets cleaned in 4 years and the looked like a herd of bulls came running through. Now I thought it was going to be a challenge for Luis to get a lot of the stains out like ( sharpie ink, high traffic footprints, marker stains, spilled drinks ). He looked at me and said "" No problem. I will let you know when I'm done."" 2 hours later, he was done. He had all of my carpets looking brand spanking New like they were just installed from the carpet shop. I got on my hands and knees to look were the heavy stains were and all of them were gone. This is the best carpet cleaning service I have had yet so far and for the $$$, you can not beat it. He definitely will be coming back for the next time I need my carpets cleaned."
Positive	"Todd Hutchins was absolutely amazing! Our project consisted of a 55,000 gallon pebble tech pool, waterfall, spa, 1 meter diving board, travertine deck, 2 fire bars, Ramada, waterwall in the courtyard, and a 1/2 acre of landscaping-We have an incredible backyard it is stunning. Todd made our vision become reality. Todd made sure our project was finished on time, construction area was clean, and most important he communicated with me and the contractors. Every job has a few hiccups, Todd made sure that they were dealt with in a timely manner and communicated everything to us. My project was finished last July and I thought I would never hear from California Pools again, but Todd still takes the time to answer questions that come up and make sure I don't have any issues. More companies need employees like Todd. Honestly, I can't say enough about Todd. Any company can build a beautiful pool not all of them can provide quality customer service while doing it!

Jesse R is another incredible employee, that I have had the pleasure of dealing with at California Pools. I meet Jesse once my project was completed-he did my pool start up.  This guy knows his stuff! He know everything about the Hayward System. He took the time to make sure I understood how my whole system worked. He still answers my questions and it's been almost a year. He will try to walk me through how to fix whatever I have called about and if I still don't understand, he has stopped by to show me.  More companies need employees that take the time like Jesse.

California Pools built me an incredible courtyard, backyard, pool and spa but what makes them different is their employees who take the time to communicate with you and achieve your vision."
Positive	5 star rating again for great customer service and response time. Your tech,Levi was very dedicated to getting our line unblocked for me.He hung in there till it was open and made sure there was no more restrictions in our line. We feel Levi is a great asset to your organization and would like to see him do more of our plumbing calls in the future. Once again your service was excellent as always! Thank you!
Positive	Nice patio for al fresco dining.  Shared a couple of appetizers with a friend.  The first was the tuna poke chips that have great flavor; loved the rice chips.  The second was the wings.  Again great flavor.  Lots of cocktails on happy hour special; I got the French 95 because I like bourbon.
Positive	"Ok...first I never met a coffee shop I didn't like. But they are so efficient here it's almost sick. First, they are always packed. Someone once told me they are the busiest Starbucks in the nation....not sure if I believe that...but they are busy.  A store this small and busy should be frustrating. But it's not. They keep you moving, and most take out anyway. So, the service is good, but the employees are friendly and helpful. They make the experience pleasant. 

I go here when I can. The only downside is its so busy it can get noisy, so if you're going to work, that can be tedious, but if that's the only complaint, that's not too bad."
Positive	Absolutely LOVE this place!!! Great happy hour, great service, great food, and the ambience is beautiful. Perfect for a date, or just meeting up with the girls for happy hour on the patio. I have been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed in anything.
Positive	"Cacao 70 is a ultra chocolate themed restaurant on trendy mount royal (a cross between Williamsburg Brooklyn , Wynnwood near miami and Chelsea New York.The restaurant..of course has strong  wifi  and abundant electric all outlets. More importanly it boasts chocolates and cocoa from around the world and has dark chocolate menu items which seem awesome. Prices seem fair. I had a dark chocolate mint frappe which was delicious and refreshing.
."
Positive	Our family just had a great Sunday dinner, trying a couple new menu selections. Chopped salad, cheddar beef sandwich, and the mushroom  pasta. As always, the food was great and the staff was very helpful, Erin was our server and checked back a couple times making sure all was well. We look forward to the next visit.
Positive	Tried this spot out for lunch with some coworkers. Get here early for lunch, because it does get busy. I did a build your own bowl and it was yummy! Fresh veggies, chicken, and you can make it spicy or mild. VERY filling, quick and a nice switch up from your normal lunch fare.
Positive	This place is really good but not easy on the stocmach if you are lactose intollerant. I didn't think I was that bad...but I GUESSED WRONG! The custard was soooo good though I couldn't stop eating it and suffered the pain later! If you have never had it...you have to try it. Its well worth it!
Positive	Was very impressed with quality of furniture and found some beautiful pieces for a client that were reasonably priced. Had an issue with customer service but I will definitely shop here again!!
Positive	"Finally got to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, well worth it!

Customer service was great and service was fast.

Cute spot and awesome area of town.

Pizza, (which they will split for You if You want to try 2 types) top notch Rustic Style, Minimal pies but very balanced and Tasty. Salad and other options are meek but good quality.

The only reason it's 4 stars is it's over-priced and not too many options, but I love and respect what they are doing. More of a destination location then a stop by Pizza joint."
Positive	"Ate at Scarpetta's on a Wednesday night, week before New Year's so it wasn't packed, got seated by a really friendly hostess. Upon sitting down we were offered two types of water, nice touch. A few minutes later passed and we were greeted by the assistant manager Kelly, asked if this had been our first time and we replied yes. 

Knowing the Executive chef Dan Rossi, we were treated to having him select our food and then having his wine sommelier (Paulo) pair wines with each course. If you know very little about wines, like myself, I would highly recommend Paulo making the decisions for you, this guy is a master at his trade. Our wines complimented each course perfectly and it truly made the night one to remember. 

Trying to remember everything we ate would be a six page review so I'll just touch on a few must haves, not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy every dish, because everything was an orgasmic explosion of flavors on the tongue, but I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Polenta with a five mushroom ragu, unbelievable. Their signature spaghetti, out of this world. Ravioli's with Foie Gras and duck, I could have eaten 20. Some Carmel pudding dessert with this homemade salted Carmel toffee with crushed pretzels was insane. That was just a few of the fifteen things we got, also Fritto Misto, is a must. 

Basically your not going to go wrong with anything in this place, food is off the hook, service staff paid attention to every detail and the view of the Strip is the best. This will be on my stop every time I visit Vegas from here on out, period."
Positive	I had the time of my life.  It was so much fun. I had never been on a club crawl before.  Me and my friends enjoyed the 1923 Club and the view from the Foundation Room was awesome.Didn't have to wait in long lines. I hate waiting.  Our host was humorous and very knowledgable.  He kept us laughing a lot. Vegas has some crazy club scenes. I will definitely go with Premier Club Tours again. It was an awesome experience.
Positive	"Awesome sushi burrito place with a variety of raw sushi options.  I like how they have different sauces and toppings to put in their burritos, such as kimchi crunches, won ton chips, mayo, seaweed salad, spicy sauces, etc

You get to see them make the burrito too, and they pack them full and tight!!  Love this stuff! 

They also sell burrito bowls too, but when I'm at a burrito place, I gotta get the burrito :). Yum!!

So this is basically a huge fat sushi roll, not sliced up. And I think the burrito is better than a sushi roll, in my opinion, because you get fatter stuff in the seaweed wrap and you have more ingredients inside. 

Also they have taro chips too - in 3 different flavors. They give samples too if you're not sure. 

Service was great here too.

Would definitely recommend!!"
Positive	"Super friendly and helpful staff and delicious healthy juices - what's not to love? Not to mention that it's in a super convenient location. After eating greasy (but delicious) pizza from Secret Pizza, my friend and I were craving something fresh and healthy to beat the Vegas heat. 

As soon as we stepped up to the counter, an employee was instantly there ready to give us samples of literally every juice and milk. He explained each one's ingredients and health benefits, and most importantly, kept the samples coming until I knew which one I wanted!

I ended up selecting the Bee Grateful, which is funny because I don't like carrot juice at all. It's refreshing and just sweet enough without being too much. For reference, I always get my boba tea drinks at 30-50% sweetness level, so this was perfect. 

Tip: If you're planning on heading up to the Boulevard Pool with your drink, there's a guy at the bottom of the escalator who will tell you that glass bottles aren't allowed (for obvious reasons), and you'll need to put your juice into a plastic cup he gives you."
Positive	"Busy place on a friday night. cool interior-- although I think their attempt to look authentic comes across as a bit campy. Still, good sushi place.

Sit right at the bar and you'll get instant service. We never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion. The Screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had. The meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce. I agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here, but it is tasty nonetheless. The jerry roll went down smoothly, and the crunch roll can be addicting. Dynamite was very filling and a good value pick ( if you don't mind baked rolls). For those who don't know, it's a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce. They offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri. The yellowtail was very thick-- some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i've ever seen. The squid was as well. You don't have to go AYCE to get a good value here, especially if you're willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings.

We left quite full, and I would gladly return."
Positive	Great customer service! I haven't been here before, this was my first time going. I went in because my small dog needed his dew claw cut. I didn't have to wait, she cut my dogs dew claw in a couple seconds, and she didn't even charge me. What a great person! I will definitely be back for my other dog's grooming needs!
Positive	Celebrating our 11th reunion. Have been inseparable ever since. Waited 11 months to make it legal and get married. We chose your restaurant because of the ambiance, great quality of food, exceptional service and how special you make us feel. Thank you for making our special day unforgettable.
Positive	"Kung Fu Tea offers its customers a looooooot of choices for drinks and toppings. Let's just say that you'll probably always have something new to try. 

This place always seemed packed, which is a good sign I suppose. My friends and I, a group of 7, went after dinner on a Friday evening around 9pm and the line was pretty much out the door with no seats. Even with the rush of people, my drink was made fairly quickly. The room itself isn't that big so we had to snag the first table we saw. 

Hot drinks are only available in one size -- the large. It was a lot to drink. I couldn't finish it. I wish they offer hot drinks in a slightly smaller size. 

The KF oolong milk tea is very good. This place makes it on the milkier side by default which I really enjoy! This place also offers lactaid for those who want a non-dairy choice. 

I've also had the coconut milk tea and almond milk tea and didn't quite like it despite how I like both drinks. It just wasn't my cup of tea (ha ha ha..). 

Anyway, i'll be back to try more things! It's a great place for people to just ""hang out"" and have boba.  Don't forget to check in for a free topping! I love the boba with hot milk tea here... So perfect for the winter!

Edit: The Oreo Oolong Milk Tea is good! Yum"
Positive	Finally a place that makes TAMALES as big as me and mmmmm mmmmmm  ggooooooddddd!!!!!! My experience here was awesome to say the least i had a excellent meal everything was extremely fresh and well cooked . The service was spot on. The staff acted as if i was family and were extremely helpful on the menu rundown. We will definitely be back!!!
Positive	I really enjoyed the food here. Samosas were fantastic! The service was tremendous as well. Everyone was engaging and friendly and definitely not overbearing. I would love to try this place at lunch the next time I am in Mesa!
Positive	"Super fun atmosphere. Hottest spot to party in LV. Beautiful outdoor space.

I went to see Skrillex and want to assume that it was so packed because of him, but it really was a little insane.

We found a spot to sit along the pool and dip our feet in. The people here are gorgeous and made for fun people watching.

It got sloppy towards the end of the night when people were getting into the pool fully clothed. It was a magical sight.

Prepare for a long cab line. Took us at least 45 minutes when we left around 3."
Positive	Typically one of the less expensive places for gas on this side of town. I have not been inside so I can't speak to other reviews. I used the car wash once and it did a satisfactory job.
Positive	"It was a great idea to go to Bubba Gump for dinner.
We had table outside with a perfect view!!
Shrimp were great and special thanks to our server. Unfortunately don't remember his name but he was working with trainee (around 8 pm on 27th of October).
So professional and friendly!
We had a great evening!"
Positive	"We live a few minutes' drive from Millennium  McCormick, home of the Pinon Grill. We recommend it very highly. The entire facility is inviting, open, bright, and airy. The restaurant overlooks a beautiful, large covered patio by a lake with mountain views in the distance. 

The friendly hostess seated us at a table by a large window. Irma, our server, greeted us warmly and took our drink orders. My wife and I explored the breakfast menu as we sipped our  coffee and tea. Ellen ordered what turned out to be amazing lemon ricotta pancakes with bacon. I ordered their loaded breakfast sandwich on toasted rye. It was superb! 

Irma checked on us during the meal with a highly professional touch, giving the Pinon Grill a special warm character. We plan to go back for more of their special brand of hospitality, good food, and relaxation."
Positive	"I found this salon through Yelp about four months ago, and have been coming here ever since.  I adore my stylist, Zita.  in addition to being friendly and professional, she's also extremely skilled.  We've done hair treatments, cuts, and hair extensions, and I've loved every look she's given me.  

In my opinion, the mark of a true hair stylist is how she/he cuts your hair so that it grows out well.  I'm happy to say that my hair looks just as good grown out as it does when it was initially cut and styled.  

I've already recommended my stylist to a few people and will definitely continue to do so!"
Positive	"My wife and I recently visited Las Vegas for our anniversary. As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Friday afternoon we chose to start our GR Tour of Vegas at the Pub and Grill. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and seated. Within a few min we were introduced to our server Joe. For anyone reading this, please ask to sit in Joe's section. His friendliness, and knowledge of the menu was refreshing. He was able to make some suggestions that sounded amazing, however after seeing the nachos Gordon Ramsay posted on his Instagram we couldn't help but give them a try, and boy are we glad we did! They are out of this world! In addition to the nachos we enjoyed a chicken pesto sandwich. While the flavor was amazing I almost cracked a tooth about half way through on a chicken bone. I discreetly brought this to Joe's attention so he could give the chef a heads up for future sandwiches. What was impressive, is where most servers acknowledge and nothing ever comes of it, he immediately spoke to his manager Derek who came over to apologize and even went as far as offering us a dessert. To think I almost left needing dental work, but still feel compelled to give a 5 star rating should tell you how great Joe and Derek were! They both truly understand the meaning of customer service and I hope someone at the Gordon Ramsay Group reads this to provide them with the recognition they deserve! 

PS - The sticky toffee is to die for and personally I think it has Steak beat!"
Positive	By mistake the taxi driver took us there for pizza. The server was very help full, friendly . We ordered three different pizza, veggie, spinach, arugula with bruschetta .All of them great crust & great taste . Love the bread they serve . Love the bear the server recommend.we all are very happy to find this place.
Positive	Clean facility, prompt shuttle service and friendly staff. Hotel is aging and rooms show it just a very small bit. Main negative note is something that is really a bit laughable. But. The neighbors are a shade noisy here! Go figure - an airport hotel where you can hear airplanes! But. It's annoying enough to make me want to book elsewhere next trip. Maybe. Really no complaint other than the noise.
Positive	I just recently  bought  a Kindle and the screen would not turn ba k on. I was told by Kindle support that  the problem  was not fixable and that I would have to buy a new tablet. I was very upset but found Ubreakifix online and made the trip to Charlotte NC to see them. They fixed the problem in less than 5 min.  You guys ROCK!!!!!
Positive	"One of the best restaurants I have ever visited in Vegas. There is no lack of good food in Vegas BUT I find that fine dining experiences are few and far between. Sinatra ticks all the boxes, from decor, service, menu and food quality.

You can't have a bad meal here, the wine list is great and the service everything it should be. For whatever reason, table service in this city can be spotty but its very good here.

Another job well done by Wynn!"
Positive	I love this place so much! I don't know how best to describe how awesome the food is and how laid back the atmosphere is! My husband and I moved out to the area recently and we have been coming here almost weekly! The papaya salad is the best I have ever had! It's got a sweetness to it that's perfect! I love all the noodle dishes and the mango curry with beef is to die for! I love the decor and the staff are sweet and welcoming. I travel a lot for work and when I come home, this is the first place I go! It's BYOB so I like that i can bring my own favorite wines too!
Positive	"One of my favorite places to stay in the strip.  In fact, I skipped a stay at Cosmopolitan to stay at the Elara.  I love the location, and the ridiculous number of restaurants within a short walk.  From McDonalds to Gordon Ramsey's, it's less than a 10 minute walk. There is even a Walgreens nearby if you forget something.

The rooms are beautiful and well kept. Great views and amenities including a Vegas ""ghost"" a coffee pot in the room! (Woo Hoo!)

No casino to walk through, and a hotel guard checking room keys at the elevators make it feel safe and enjoyable."
Positive	Love this place! Hands down the best pastrami sandwich ever!! The staff is great all around - great customer service, friendly, clean..everything! No complaints for this place here! One thing most people do comment on is the high prices but for what you get! You really can't complain!
Positive	"Nestled away in a strip mall in Mississauga you wouldn't think you would find a gem of an indian restaurant. Be prepared for a fusion of indian food, and hakka food to tempt your taste buds. 

If your a lover of indian food, but are kinda tired of the same old flavoured curries, get yourself over to Avani. The food is absolutely tasty. I have never been to an indian restaurant that takes typical North American flare and blends it so well with Indian spices the ( Tandoori Fire Roasted Rack of Lamb) is unreal. The chilli paneer is also very good. Be careful not to indulge to much on the apps. Roomali Roti...very good.

If your planning on a weekend visit, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. With that said, I was with a party of 4 and I didn't have to wait for more than 15mins.

The service does leave a little bit to be desired, and that is the only reason i won't give this place 5 stars. I mean really, how many times do I need to ask for water, before someone actually brings it..try 5.

The decor is beautiful, very modern with a very ethnic touch.

if your looking for a nice indian place for dinner or lunch, this will surely impress you."
Positive	This was an AMAZING show! Holly looked great and did a really good job! The other women were all beautiful, talented, and amazing. My favorite was Mrs. Peter. If you like burlesque then this is a must see show!!!! I would definitely go to see it again! Our seats were so close and amazing!!!
Positive	Came here for a tour was very pleased with the establishment. Very Nice and clean. It's a newer hospital. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. She was a younger nurse, light curly hair, really pretty and very helpful. I don't remember her name but I hope she's my nurse. I will be having my baby here! I'm very excited. They gave us cookies and water before the tour. Very nice gesture.
Positive	We eat here pretty much every time we come to Vegas. The Paris is one of our favorite places for food, the buffet is solid but the noodle place is out of this world. Needless to say we are familiar with all the little stops and this is a great one. I've tried all of the different crepes over my visits here and almost if them are really food. They get very busy and mess up orders sometimes. Some of the savory ones were not my favorite, but overall it's a solid offering. I wish I could give them a fifth star, but the food isn't exceptional, so I reserve that extra star for places that really dazzle me.
Positive	"Love the prices at this place! 

We had the Tofu Sukiyaki, Pan Fried Gyoza,  Banbanji, Yakiniku and Shrimp Curry. My favorite was the Banbanji appetizer. Although the flavor of all the dishes weren't out of this world, they were still good. 

The portions were just right, 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes perfectly satisfy a dinner for 2. The service was very good and timely. Next time I go back , it will probably be one of the ramen bowls on the table."
Positive	I love this place the music is fun and they'll make what you want.. They have a few signature drinks but not my kind I don't drink tequila. Its definitely a local spot to visit the staff is nice and fast CHECK IT OUT
Positive	"My new favorite place to eat sushi.
They have an alternate menu for gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options.
The vegan avocado & veggie roll were delicious. 
The vegan General Tso's cauliflower was SO good!
My husband had the TKO roll and said it was one of the best rolls he has ever had in his lifetime. 
The ambience is loud. It can fill up quickly on a weekend night.
Great place for a date night or for a group."
Positive	I have used Public Storage, so when I decided to rent a storage space at East McDowell Storage Solutions I called to find out what additional charges I was going to have to pay over and above the advertised rate of $19.95 for the first month.  To my utter amazement, there were none.  Yes, I handed over a $20 and they gave me back a nickel.  They are true to their advertising, affordable and wonderful people to deal with.  There are plenty of carts to use to move your belongings, the unit was clean and the building is open for many hours each day.  I can't recommend them enough!
Positive	New nail salon! Lovely furnishings, very pretty decor - most importantly, they care a lot about customer satisfaction. Great experience! Definitely recommend and worth coming back. Pricing is very competitive with the rest of nail salons in the area. I came running in just before closing time and they still took me in.
Positive	Yummy is all I can really say about the wedge burger and sweet potato smash fries.  Crisp fresh wedge of lettuce with tomato, red onion, blue cheese and bacon...it was really great.  Don't forget to ask for some chipotle mayo dipping sauce to go with the fries.  Kind of pricey, but one of my favorites.
Positive	"I have GREAT news!!! I wrote a review under the name Courtney D. (Couldn't login to my account at the time.  Courtney is my wife) which praised this place but dogged their Dolma due to it being mushy,  soggy, etc.  Since then,  they must have seen the review because the Dolma has gone from the worst id every had to being on par with the best ive ever had.  The leaves are firm,  the rice is cooked perfectly,  and i personally like the salt and pepper touch!  

The baklava seems to have improved tremendously as well. This has to be one of the best greek restaurants in Phoenix!!!"
Positive	So it's 90+ degrees.. sun is blazing, yet there is a crazy monsoon style breeze.  Its Saturday afternoon and after a VERY hard night of partying at Tao the night before... we decide to go to Wet Republic.  My boys showed up at 11ish and got a daybed next to the pool.  I roll in at about 1 and get swiftly let in and led to our area. The waitstaff was very attentive and kept our area clean and the drinks flowing. The ice bucket was refreshed constantly, our accompaniments were kept full and fresh. The place was brimming with some good looking people and some not haha. Rehab at Hard Rock definitely wins with what seems to be six pack abs for guys and big boobs for the ladies as requirements for admission. The music was awesome.  The DJ kept the beats flowing and the the heads kept bobbing. We decided to leave at 4ish and we tallied the bill. Three magnums of grey goose, miscellaneous snacks and gratuity.. two grand.  I have to admit.. This was probably one of the better pool parties out there.  Rehab is awesome, but we just felt a better vibe with the crowd here.. We saw people that would normally stick out like sore thumbs at Rehab, but were having a good time here.  My tip for the masses.. be prepared to spend some money and wear a good sunblock (at least 50spf).. not tanning lotion because you don't want to look like a lobster when you hit the clubs at night. Would I return?  Yea.. why not, after all.. you want to maximize your time in Vegas.. sleep is for the birds!
Positive	"Nice property! I've been to the casino several times but this was my 1st time staying. I found the rooms to be a bit small but that's about the only pseudo negative thing I have to say about the property. 
Check in was smooth and quick.  Pool was lovely. Had a few buttery croissants and tea for breakfast and took them up to the room.  I strongly suggest getting a strip view. 
Will come back!"
Positive	"I am convinced that every single shopping center in the Las Vegas Valley has a tanning salon. Some are old, some are new, some are twenty four hours, some are fancy, some are seedy. Many people would say all tanning salons are the same. A true tan-aholic would beg to differ. I have tried many tanning salons around this town, and have found the friendliest, cleanest, most affordable of the bunch. Actually, I guess I didn't find it. The more and more I went, the more and more familiar faces I saw. How could these ""friends"" of mine keep such a secret?? Well, I am here to spread the word! Radiance Tanning Salon is just off of Stephanie and Horizon, next to the new Metro Pizza. The staff is small, incredibly friendly, and will help you find the right package. If you want to tan for twenty minutes, when you really should be tanning for six, they won't let you. They really have your best interest in mind! Prices range from inexpensive twenty minute beds to super-technical-space-age-laser beam-beds. Those definitely cost a pretty penny. They also have recently purchased a ""hydration station."" I haven't tried it yet, but it is supposed to be the ultimate in  skincare technology. Fellow tanners, unite! Radiance Tanning Salon will give you that tan you want, at a price you can afford. (That totally sounds like a car commercial, but it's true!)"
Positive	Found this body shop on yelp. However, had one of the most refreshing experience i could have at a body shop. I called, they quickly responded and told me to come in to check it out. They were genuine people who do not try to take your money for every little thing!
Positive	"Want great Thai food on a budget? Keep reading.  

Go For Thai is a great spot for lunch or dinner. Prices are fantastic and the portions are healthy. When you enter, you are greeted by the very friendly staff. The décor is simple and sleek, nothing tacky in here. The booths are so cozy, but there are only a few!  

The menu offers a lot of choice. Soups and salads all the way to veggie and satays; you have a lot to choose from. We started with the Go For Thai's House Platter. It had everything. It came with calamari, spicy satay skewers, golden baskets and spring rolls. It's a big ol' plate of flavours; spicy and savoury. Yum! A great choice if no one can decide on an app. 

Now for the main courses. We chose Sweet & Sour Fish, Pad Thai, Cantonese Chow Mein and steamed rice on the side. The fish had a light batter and a light taste; my boyfriend would even eat it and he is not a seafood guy. The chow mein wasn't what I expected. I expected it to be like the Chinese variety. This had a fantastic Thai twist. They definitely didn't try to duplicate the Chinese version, they made it theirs and they made it good. The Pad Thai was also not your everyday Pad Thai, sweet and citrus made this dish stand on it's own.

The server might have been the owner. He thanked us for coming, gave us take out menus and told us about the daily specials for eat in and takeout. He was very gracious and said he hoped we'd come back. 

I've been here a few times for dinner and lunch. They are so consistent, it's crazy. Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but you soon forget once the food arrives. Fresh and fantastic!

The lunch specials are under $10 and you don't leave hungry. Great deals! 

Highly recommended for Thai in Whitby!"
Positive	Arrived at 8pm and there was only 1 other person, perfect time to arrive. Brandon waited on us and he was very informative about the special and everything on the menu. Started with the lamb tacos and deviled eggs. AMAZING. Main course got the salmon and burger. Salmon was cooked perfectly and mashed potatoes with gravy were awesome. My husband had the burger and finished it off! We will definitely be back... And to try the apricot ale they're getting next week! Thanks Brandon!!
Positive	"We have had on and off pest problems for the two years we have lived at our current rental property. We've always just dealt with them ourselves and made them sorta kinda disappear for a few months and then we'd see them back again. Yuck! This past summer we began to see the usual pest activity and the cycle started again... only this time the roaches came back FLYING. I decided to call out some professionals to take care of my winged friends. Booking was extremely easy, the gal over the phone was super helpful, and we had someone out to our home within 2 days. Our guy was Wayne and he was awesome! Polite, personable, and efficient. Our initial treatment took 30 minutes and Wayne explained everything. He even assured us that as soon as the treatment was dried (30 minutes to an hour) that it was safe for the kiddo and our 3 dogs. Within 2 hours of Wayne leaving our home we saw some dead ""friendlies"". I was highly impressed and I am pleased to say that even a month later whenever we saw a roach, it was a dead one which is the only kind of roach that's okay in my book. If you're looking for a consistent pest control service that actually works then look no further. Insectek is the best!"
Positive	Greeted at the front entrance, handed free beads and a raffle ticket for a chance to win money. Great strong frozen drinks. I recommend mixing mud slid and banana tastes just like a frozen chocolate banana so yummy. Loved playing the old coin slots love the sounds and fun. Waitress around alot asking if you need a drink. Had a great time and recommend you stop and visit this place before they take this gem away from us.
Positive	"Went in for the hexx chocolate making tour.. Our guide was sweet.. Let us taste the chocolates without pestering us to buy them in return..
Couldn't resist the ice creams on our way back.. Had their spicy mango and raspberry lime sorbets .. Were true to their names and tasted natural.."
Positive	"Was at Brunswick Zone XL Gilbert Lanes for my company's team appreciation event the past weekend.  Our party was in one of the private rooms, it was set up nicely, there was a few small issues with the food that was ordered and what we were offered, but Brunswick quickly offered solutions for the problems, they had superb customer service.

I am the worst bowler, I try, but it just doesn't work, unless I use the bumpers and well I wasn't going to. Normally I just don't bowl, but I can say I had a fun time bowling.  

We were comp'd some free games of laser tag, now that was a fun time, its 2 stories  and pretty spread out so you don't feel like your over crowded, it was a group of 9 of us, solo missions, we were given a brief explanation of rules and then set free to play. I don't even know how long we were playing but it was a lot of fun. Your gun has a name on it, and that's your name for the game and at the end you find out where you places amongst your friends, and well I came in 7th haha, but who cares!

They have a small area for arcade games, stuff the younger ones would like, some ice ball, basketball, bumper cars and air hockey too.
It was a fun time, Im just not a bowler but if you are, this is your place to go."
Positive	"After multiple delays in Pinkberry getting to the strip (remember when they were supposed to open at the Forum Shops in 2007?), I finally got to check out what all the commotion was about.  I had only heard about it from others.

There are some big differences between Pinkberry and their frozen yogurt competitors:

- They are really pushing the health factor and with the addition of their Greek yogurt line, it makes it seem OK to get a large portion even if you just stuffed your face at a buffet beforehand.  

- Their original flavor was a lot less tart than Yogurtland or Red Mango and that was a big plus for me.  It was smooooooth.  

- I also liked some of their creative seasonal flavors like key lime and lychee.  I heard they offer other choices like watermelon and pumpkin at different times of the year.  The flavor department of Pinkberry sounds like a fun place to work.

- I dislike that the staff has to put the toppings on and puts a number limit based on the size you order.  They charge more than others so we should have it the way we want it.    

Consider me a fan overall though.  I can't imagine I would drive to the strip just for this (especially since I would have to park at Aria and then walk over) but I would definitely be down when I am in the vicinity."
Positive	"I really love spicy food and my friends brought me here to satisfy my craving for it. It is a small casual restaurant with indo-chinese dishes. Basically, it is the kind of cuisine you would get in north-eastern China.  We ordered Chana bhatura, chicken lollipop and chillies momos. There Chana bhatura was so so. The bhatura was undercooked. But the chicken lollipops and chillies momos were amazing. The chilli momos are the best thing to order if you like my kind of spicy, that is, very very very spicy :)
I would definitely visit it back when I am in Toronto. 
Also, price-wise the place is ok. The service is good enough."
Positive	Came here with the family on a Wednesday. First timers and wow the food was great! I ordered the wings and they did not disappoint. Services was 50/50. Bar tender was a little rude when we were ordering our drinks but our server made up for her rudeness. I'll stop by again if I'm ever in the area but probably won't seat at the bar if the same bar tender is working.
Positive	"Am visiting Las Vegas for a basketball tournament.  Had a few hours in between games, Mexican sounded good.  

Found Leticia's in the area after a quick search.  When I walked in, the place has an odd smell, maybe it was the furniture or ventilation?  It wasn't an encouraging first impression.

Decor is nice, wood furniture with lots of Windows.  Service very friendly.

When the chips and salsa came, it came with a red, green and bean dip.  Both salsas had excellent flavor and respectable spice level without burning your mouth.  Love bean dip, but this one had a hint of cloves which I don't generally care for.  It grew on me, however, I wondered if all the sauces were going to have ""twists"" on the traditional versions.

I ordered one chicken enchilada green sauce, one shredded beef in red sauce, and one crispy tacos.  When it came out, I got concerned again, since the presentation was really nice.  In my experience, the Mexican places with fancier presentation often lack authenticity. I usually go for no fanfare.  

To my surprise however, the chicken enchilada may have been the best I ever had.  Fresh bright flavor including fresh oregano, tart tomatillo sauce and really tender chicken breast.  Generous amount of meat too.

The shredded beef was super tender and flavorful, and the taco shells were lightly fried just the way I do them at home.  Both very good, although the chicken enchilada was the star on this day.

I'm really picky about authenticity, and Letticia's pleasantly surprised me at every turn.  I don't know if I'll ever be back in this remote area, but the locals have themselves a gem in this one.

If you're a stickler for quality and authenticity like I am, you'll really appreciate this place.  

Immaculate bathroom for bonus points lol...it matters."
Positive	"I don't know what they put in their food but I am addicted!

It is the BEST indian food that I ever had. The owners and staff are all very friendly and do a great job. 

My fav is the dinner buffet. You have quite a big assortment of food you can choose from. My absolute long time favourite is the Chicken Tiki Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo. They are to die for. Perfect amount of spices! My boyfriend and I come here since they first opened and the quality of food and service has always stayed the same ehen not even got better! They imported a chef from India. So you can be sure that the food is very authentic.
In addition to the buffet they serve delicious garlic naan and chicken on a sizzling plate. Plus the price is unbeatable.

I am in love with this place and can't get enough of it. A hidden gem! They also have a banquet hall for groups of people."
Positive	"After patiently waiting for months for this place to open up, watching it periodically when i go to work or get off or when i go to EOS (gym).... it has FINALLY opened. 

Prior to entry, they had the music playing outside and inside of the restaurant. I don't know if it was on purpose but it was my favorite korean female singer, Taeyeon. Even after we had left and was outside, it was still more of her music. HAHA ! INSTANT 5 STARS ! Jk

This is probably the ONLY Certified Angus Beef KBBQ in the state, and currently, the BEST AYCE Korean BBQ establishment in the state. If i had to judge, the quality sits in between any AYCE KBBQ establishment, and Hobak's quality (a la carte KBBQ restaurant). But for the price, i'd go for this place if I want AYCE KBBQ. 

Unfortunately, according to our waiter, Martin, they are still currently figuring out the balance between usage of the exhaust ventilation system and the air conditioning system. So intermittently, you'd feel warmer then cool. Also, to my own sadness, they didn't utilize the ""pull down exhaust systems"" like some other places have, so a LOT of smoke went outside of the vents and into the restaurant. Hopefully this won't kick them in the butt in the future

A quick mention of the grill. Unlike most other places that uses a stainless steel plate grill, this place uses a non-stick coated one. DEFINITELY NON STICK ! (for now, until customers dig their tongs in and mess up the coating). Also a good amount of heat pushed out by the burners creating a nice crust on most things we cooked ! Don't know why or if its due to the gas output overall, a lot of places seem weak. 

OK ! BACK TO THE FOOD ! Who cares about the restaurant? jk Like some KBBQ in the city or other cities, they have 3 AYCE options (A - $22.95, B - $26.95, and C - $32.95) [please refer to picture of menu for reference]. Also, there are a la carte option and combos, like some places in town. Mutually through the table, we had opt'ed for option B which included more options than A, but did not have some C options, but we didn't really care too much about. 

Things we had tried was Black Angus Beef Brisket/Rib Eye Steak/LA Kalbi/Salted Beef Boneless Short Rib/Marinated Short Rib, as well as beef tongue, rib finger meat, organic kurobuta pork belly/shoulder blade, soy-glazed pork jowl, and the spicy baby octopus. 

My favorites were probably the brisket/tongue/rib eye steak/short rib/boneless short rib, and the pork jowl. 

""Brisket"" and ""Tongue"" are always good options for easy and fast cooking. They actually had a pretty decent amount of marbling within which made it even more melty in your mouth. 

The ""Rib Eye Steak"" was pretty marbleized as well ! Nice and tender ! Could have used a bit of salt to season though (we asked for salt later to use for other meats)

The ""Marinated Short Rib"" is similar to Seoul kbbq style galbi where its a flap of meat butterflied from a large short rib bone. Unfortunately they only offer a marinated version, but luckily, its not super marinated in terms of flavor, but quite light instead ! 

""L.A. Kalbi"" is the ""standard"" galbi you see at most KBBQ or hawaiian restaurants with the 3 bones. Similar marinade as the previous. 

The ""Salted Beef Boneless Short Rib"" is as mentioned, boneless short rib but i don't know where the ""salted"" part went. Tasted like other non-marinated to be honest. Haha. Only downside is the portion you get per order is like 6-8 1x2 inch pieces. 

""Kurobuta Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder Blade"". To be honest, i didn't taste much difference in these two meats. They are tasty but nothing too special? Needs some salt too. 

""Soy Glazed Pork Jowl"" didn't seem much glazed, but like plain pork jowl. Downside is they cut their jowl fairly thin, in comparison to the irregularly shaped pieces other restaurants offer, but it does make for quick cooking (all know pork takes forever, esp jowl)

""Rib finger meat"" was a bit unexpected. It was in similar slices like salted beef boneless short rib. 1x2 inch sizes. Much less fatty. 

Last but not least, the ""spicy baby octopus"". Upon arrival, it looked like it was super marinated in a spicy sauce, but maybe not. It was actually quite light after cooking it. 

Dessert, we had all got the korean style cinnamon pastry w/ our choice of ice cream. Unfortunately, i prefer the hoeddeok to be cooked a bit more. Weirdly, their ""dough"" aspect seems more chewy than onces ive ate in the past. 

Our server, Martin, did an AMAZING job. Very attentive. Tried to the best of his ability to answer our questions, get our orders in, refill our waters. For a soft opening, he made it feel like a normal working day ! Absolutely great service ! 

I'm going to have trouble avoiding this place after i leave the gym from now on...... oh boy"
Positive	"I popped in with a friend for the first time last night; I live right around the corner and I am unsure what took me so long to visit.  

I'd like to think I know a little something about beer but my friend is a bit of a brew snob.  He was pretty impressed with the selection and really enjoyed the Moroccan Brown (?) that is apparently really hard to find on tab.  (I also had it and would agree it was one of the best beers I've had in a while, especially among winterish types of beer).    

The dark lager I tried next, was not nearly as good.  But again, kudos for having interesting beers that are hard to come by in Toronto.

A pint was $7.50--totally fair for what you are enjoying.

On a Saturday evening, at about 9pm, the place was pretty lively--you might want a backup plan in pocket if you are coming out just in case you can't get a seat.  (The staff seemed on top of things and I didn't witness anyone leave without getting a table).

Highly recommended if you are in the area looking for a piece of Ossington hipness without crossing the Don or going south to Queen.  Worth coming out for?  Perhaps.  I'd need to try the food to be sure but it seems like you won't be dissappointed if you are the kind of foodie who doesn't mind a little TTC action before sinking into a meal."
Positive	"We reserved this restaurant for a birthday party around end of November. We were around 20 people so we needed to book multiple tables. We were given the table at the far end of the restaurant and two more tables which were in the same area. 

The service was EXCELLENT. It was a party and we were all over the place. Our server however, (and honestly the rest of the staff) were quite cooperative and understanding. This is important because we were on their way from kitchen to the dining area and also one of their cash stations. For 25$, they took care of the cake the best way I could think of. 

We wanted to order tea for each person at the time the cake was served and this meant we wanted to get 25 of their cups! They just accomodated everything to the best of it. The gentleman which I believe was the manager was continuously making sure that everything is in place with us and with other guests. 

I don't think I need to talk about the food and the quality. We ordered a mixture of breakfast and lunch and they were all at their perfect level. Their famous egg's benedict is phenomenal. All my guests and my sister (whose BDay we were celebrating) were quite happy with everything. Food, drink, environment, staff, location. quality, accommodation, ...

This review could probably be a way I say thanks for the great experience we had at the lovely Oxley's"
Positive	Seriously fantastic massage from Peter. Definitely in the top ranks, and thats saying something because my mom used to be a masseus and I've had my fair share of massages. I will say that it could've been uncomfortable had I not read the previous Yelpers reviews. It is a communal massage room, dim lights, soft music playing with minimal distractions. I was asked to take my top off and bra when I was turning over to have my back massaged, this was fine, although slightly awkward. When I walked in they took me right away, the technique was spot on and so relaxing. I explained prior to going back any issues that could arrise such as my recent foot surgery, and the front desk girl translated to Peter, so he accomodated me. I returned the next day as well to see Peter for another amazing massage. I even intended to go a third time but he wasnt working the last day I was there. When I return to Vegas I will visit Happy Feet again. Because the massage was so great I tipped  $20 each time. Unless your massage is crap,  I suggest tipping this amount. Hope this helps!
Positive	"Stumbled upon it in Caesar's Palace and was pleasantly surprised. Hostess initially wouldn't let us in w/ outside drinks but when she saw my struggle to ""chug"" a full vodka tonic she eased up & told me to say it was H20. Appreciate that! 
Our waiter was kinda a jerk (Steven) and seemed not to have patience with the 2 of us. He didn't explain the menu when we had questions, completely forgot a drink order and then left us once our food arrived. Asked for a steak knife for our cauliflower steak (delicious) but never got one and had to use a butter knife to cut. 
The busser tended to us with refills and was nice- Steve appeared with the bill and that was all. 

Food was delicious and highly recommend the pig ears. Not crunchy but not soggy and the cilantro w like was IDEAL for a shared pre dinner nosh. 

Cauliflower steak was perfect; not too heavy and the sauces were paired perfectly. 

Duck fat fries were good but alittle on the salty side."
Positive	"I have never considered myself a Buffet connoisseur by any means. I do enjoy certain items from a Buffet that I can keep coming back to though. If you have ever been to a buffet with me you know I never fill up my plate to where I cannot see the white of the buffet plate. I am choosy with what I eat at a buffet and pace myself!

With that said, I love this buffet. Mainly because of their option of Bone Marrow! Yes, I am a Bone Marrow fiend. Come on now, if you could have all you can eat roasted Bone Marrow smeared on little toasts you would love this place too! If it were socially acceptable, I would pile up dem bones on my plate but I do believe in social graces so I will just take multiple trips.

The other selections of food are pretty good for a buffet. The Angry Mac and Cheese as well as the cutting board selections are great. I have been here when they had duck bao buns but I have not seen them in awhile but the variety and change up of different food items are pretty darn good.

So if you see a plate full of bones at the Wicked Spoon, it is probably mine! Yum!"
Positive	Went for breakfast, and love that the full menu was available even though it was about 9:30am since I'm not much of a breakfast person. That being said, I went out on a limb and ordered the Berry Strong. It was fantastic! Tons of fresh fruit and the orange agave syrup was nice and light. Add the great selection of hot tea they have, and it was a great way to start my day off right.
Positive	"Unbelievable pizza and even better customer experience!! Emma was BEYOND helpful in making our our pies and her personality made us feel like we wanted to come back every day for lunch!!

If you're in the mood for pizza or just looking for a nearby lunch spot then look no further!"
Positive	This was our first time eating here.  We will definitely be back!  Avocado BLT is delicious - I added jalapeño mayo for a little kick. The bread was lightly toasted and delicious.  If you like batter dipped onion rings...you need to try them!  Yum!!!!  Philly cheesesteak sliders were good.  My son had the chicken diablo pita.  He asked them to leave off the Serrano peppers so it wasn't hot at all.  So glad we found this place.
Positive	I am a big fan of the Massage Envy program, in general, and this particular location is very well maintained, clean and every therapist I have been treated by has been very good. I recommend the 90 minute sessions over the 60 minute sessions because there is a fixed amount of time at the beginning and end of each session for set up and exit, so the 90 minute sessions result in a lot more therapeutic activity being delivered.
Positive	I've been coming here for years since I live right down the street, their food is very very good and their portions are ridiculously big! Seriously I'll have left overs for about 3 days, service is good, delivery is always pretty quick. Really nothing bad to say about this place, will continue to come here for more years to come! Thank you Golden China!!!
Positive	"Sasha is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met, inside out. I've lived and worked around strip clubs for much of my life, mostly in Vegas! I rarely feel like a review is necessary, but this dancer is exceptional. She has stunning curves and a gorgeous smile. Her beauty and fun, effervescent personality made my visit worth all the money I spent, and then some.

She can carry a great conversation about anything . 
 
It was great to be at a strip club and talk to the dancer about animals !! Sometimes you find great connections where you least expect it. 

Thanks Sasha . We had a great time !!"
Positive	This is probably my favorite Mediterranean spot in town. The baklava is divine. Not too pricey, and amazing customer service I can't say enough. I almost forgot parking is never an issue.
Positive	"Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up. Great overall experience. Especially considering we brought them a bus load. That can be extremely challenging. Michelle was more than accommodating. She was without a doubt the best host/manager we've ever had the pleasure of working with. She made us feel warm and welcome from the very first phone call.
On top of that the food was fantastic and service was great. I'd recommend the Fahitas and the Lava Cake.

Everyone was pleased. Fred's Playland thanks Michelle and Chili's."
Positive	After visit number two, this place is not as horrible as some reviews said. Yes, it's a laundromat, not a fun place ever, but clean. The attendant was helpful, even though she may be a smoker. I had two dryers not heating and she refunded me and started them in another dryer without me paying. I did not see any kids running around without parents and most customers were elderly. There was, a guy of course, sorting dirty laundry on a folding table. The attendant came over and wiped it right when he was done. Overall, good if laundromats are good! Ha ha
Positive	"Haven't been to this Good Egg since I moved across the valley 4 years ago. 

My wife and I arrived at 11 on a Saturday morning and there was a 15 min wait, so we took counter seats. Our server greeted us within five mins. 

My wife ordered the Good Egg Traditional, with two eggs, potatoes, three fat sausages and toast plus she added coffee. I got the Good Egg Benedict, which came with potatoes plus I got a small juice. It came to $25.11 plus tip. 

Our meal arrived in about 12 minutes. Both were cooked perfectly, with plenty of hollandaise on mine. We really didn't need or want to change anything. It was just what we were expecting for a diner breakfast and we left full, satisfied and smiling. 

I recommend the Good Egg to anyone wanting a hearty breakfast."
Positive	Target is an upgrade of Wallymarts. This location is alright at best, but again, nothing special.  Most of the special fountain hills progeny come here to work when there is nothing else available, so PLEASE, do not expect above average literacy here. Shop wisely my friends.
Positive	My wife and I ate at Ohya on February 16, 2018 and she had an allergic reaction the following day. Not sure if it was just a coincidence but I wanted to ask if anyone else had a similar experience after dinning there.
Positive	"I have been to Blue Man Group a few times over the years. I have always enjoyed it. It's very unique and funny. Most recently we got tickets through House Seats and were offered seats in the poncho section. The poncho section is the first several rows where you run the risk of getting hit with flying paint and Twinkies. You're given a poncho to keep you dry. We were in the second row a little left of center. Fortunately we weren't hit with any spraying liquids. 

In the past, I've had seats in the back. No matter where I've sat, I've had a great view and a great time. 

If you're looking for an out of the ordinary but very enjoyable show, Blue Man Group's what you're looking for!"
Positive	Love this restaurant! Sushi is always fresh. Great happy hour prices and choices. If you have a large party, I suggest getting there early or maybe making a reservation on weekends.
Positive	We were in Las Vegas with another couple who own several Italian restaurants in another city and our group of four thoroughly enjoyed our meal here after a poor experience the previous night at the tourist trap, Giada.  The service here was friendly and prompt. We shared and enjoyed every dish that was ordered by our group and found an extensive and reasonably priced wine list.
Positive	"Pink Dolphin Pool Care has gone above and beyond what I expected through their weekly pool maintenance. I have been very pleased with the team, their professional service, and my sparking pool. Steve quickly responds to my minor concerns and the entire time is very courteous.
When I needed to replace my pump and filter, they were very knowledgeable and considerate in finding a quality system that fit my budget.
Overall, I am very pleased and highly recommend Pink Dolphin Pool Care."
Positive	Just had our lunch here and I must say it was absolutely AMAZING!!!! Their savory crepes are made with buckwheat and they are incredible. You have to try France crepe. The owner is very kind and friendly. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had! I'll be back my my family. That's a great place to start your day.
Positive	Visiting from Chicgaoland and have to say this deep dish was great ! Service has been excellent as well! Will be back this week for dinner as well. We love pizza and this will be at the top of our pizza experience. Our server Tim was excellent , best service I've had in awhile !
Positive	"Probably my favorite Italian spot in CLE area, came highly recommended and met all its expectations. A little small, maybe hosts 12 tables or so, would recommend making reservations in advance. 

The smells are just amazing and you grow more impatient with each minute waiting for your food to come. Service was prompt and very helpful/pleasant. What's an Italian meal that doesn't start with bread. Freshly baked, light and flaky. Hate it when some places bring out frozen butters wrapped in foil. Not this place, whipped butter with garlic and herbs. 

For main entrée, I got my usual chicken parmigiana and again asked for extra sauce. Whopping portions. Pasta al dente and fresh. Chicken tender and juicy, with perfect amount of breading. Sauce, bellisimo.

I recommend this place to all my out of town friends who want Italian"
Positive	Just wanted to highlight the exceptional customer service I received from Kayla. Not only was I impressed by her product knowledge but her incredible 'people skills' were note worthy as well. Her attention to the clientele was sincere and she managed a good balance of being friendly and professional. Her advice on what I needed was spot on and as much as I haven't shopped at the DM before, I swear by your products now. This location was also great, clean shop and very inviting. Great experience overall.
Positive	"If you weren't looking for this place you'd drive right by and if you are already in the parking lot of the strip mall it is located in you'd never know it was here due to its sort of interior location between buildings.

I really like the bread they use...dare I say better than Cap's bread?  Yep, I said it.  I had the Club Tuna, #15 to be exact, and the quality was really good with all of the vegetables being fresh.  The only thing I'd prefer is that the tuna had a bit more flavor...some simple relish would suffice.  Also the drink offerings were not my style...I don't drink soda.  How about some fresh brewed ice-tea like everyone else has?

Service was good all around and the place was clean.  The restroom even had soap in the soap dispenser!  One confusing thing to me which I suppose could be a problem on a busy day is when the sandwich is done they just call out its number (i.e. ""Number 15"")...what happens on a busy day when maybe 3 people have the same order?  A brawl could ensue!

All in all it was a good place to grab a quick lunch since I was in the area.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to get here but if and when I'm driving by during lunch I will definitely stop back in to try another sandwich."
Positive	"I went here with 3 friends for a Sunday brunch. One friend ordered ""The Pig"", a three meat pizza. The crust was perfectly fluffy and not too thin. Another ordered the "" Short Rib Hash"". Which is only available on weekends and was delicious. 

Suffice to say we will be returning at some time in the near future."
Positive	had lunch here last Friday 3 people we ordered 2 orders of wings they took about 30 then they were room temperature I still ate them all because they were good but I mentioned it to the waitress and the manager came over and said he would take both wings off the bill that was way more then generous I will definitely come back I also tipped my server $15.00 on the remaining $6.00 bill she was great the kitchen screwed up. thanks to the manager great customer service
Positive	Twin is the consummate professional.  We had a pigeon issue in our attic and he was diagnosing the issue while doing an attic inspection (for free) and made sure all of our questions and concerns were addressed.  Because we wanted our attic issue fixed immediately, we ended up going with another company that was able to schedule us sooner, but that wouldn't stop me from ever calling them again.  We ended up calling again to have some pigeon spikes installed elsewhere as that wasn't as time sensitive and also having them spray for insects around the perimeter of our house.  We are very pleased with the work and the professionalism.  Thank you!
Positive	So I'm not actually the person who got the tattoo however it was my cousin and I got the pleasure of watching every step of it. Kelly is the lady who gave him his very first tattoo and she did an awesome job. He was happy with his first tattoo and I was ecstatic watching him get it. Kelly was given some basic information about what he wanted and she really brought his tattoo to life. She did a great job and it's healing perfectly. Now my son and I are going to experience our first tattoos with her in a month from now. Thanks Kelly for the great tattoo. Ariana thank you for your initial help when we first arrived and  throughout our visit there, you are great host. I would definitely recommend Paris Tattoo shop and let Kelly create your tattoo masterpiece....Thanks Kelly!
Positive	This shoppers at Coxwell and Danforth is really well kept. The cashiers are quite friendly, and it's got a lot of space to move around. There are usually homeless people outside the entrance though.
Positive	"Our backyard was empty and was nothing but dirt and rocks. We had a couple of companies come out and give us estimates for grass and bushes. The last company who came out was Sun Scape. They took photos of our yard and drew a layout with what they were going to do. The other companies did not do this. Sunscape also suggested some cement dividers for the yard and I knew then that they were going to be more expensive than the other companies because of the blueprint they made and the cement. When we got our estimate I was totally surprised at how affordable they are! They were less expensive than the other companies and their quality work and customer service was better.

We get their weekly services and they are always reliable. I love that they speak English in the office and at my home because I can talk to them about my grass and flowers and they can communicate back to me.

I highly recommend this company."
Positive	I absolutely love this place. I have been to them in Chicago and this one is just as good in my opinion. The only downside is the wait time for their traditional deep dish pizzas but as long as you plan accordingly, it's not a problem
Positive	Love love the pasta carbonara, ordered this each of the two visits. The saltiness and richness of the pasta dish really reminded me a dish back home. What they can really improve upon is to serve filtered water in the already fantasic chilled bottles and to unified the portioning of the pastas. Though portioning difference isn't very big, it sometimes irks me. I will definiately revisit this location as a regular whenever I get ths chance. Strongly recommend everything! I am very excited to explore the menu..
Positive	Great atmosphere! Great service! Wasn't that impress about the menu! But it worth a try! Lack of hot meals selections, more tapas & cold choices! Paid almost 400$ for 3 adults and wasn't that full and satisfying!
Positive	What a Tea only store.  Tea made from natural ingredients.   I tried pineapple berry blue very yummy & got a bag to go home. Also tried berry kiwi colada yummy as well. Just pure awesomeness.   A must try or a place to get great tea.
Positive	I saw these pictures and wondered if I should come here with my granddaughter. But I did anyway because she screams and I needed someone who would at least attempt it. We saw Jamie. Amazing experience. She blew bubbles with her, played with her, made her laugh and feel comfortable. I was so grateful. The only time my granddaughter cried was when it was time to leave. We will definitley be going back to her.
Positive	Grabbed a chicken and beef shwarma....under 10 bucks it left me full for the whole day! And not that disgusting full (like after eating a whole pizza) where it sucks all of your energy, but full and energetic (nice portion of veggies, whole wheat and protein!). Chicken was grilled with a nice little charcoal flavour, beef was tender and flavourful. Friendly staff as well.
Positive	Renata is awesome. She is professional and kind. My eye brows came out beautifully. She was very accommodating and squeezed me in before my vacation, I really appreciate her going the extra mile as she was already booked. I definitely recommend. (Process is about 2hrs, start to finish)
Positive	Just moved here from California and have been looking for a nail shop and it took over 2 months before I found this place which was recommended by a coworker. And I must say the customer service and the great focus on detail for color and design is amazing! Will be my new regular mail shop from now on. Thanks ladies!!!
Positive	Service was good. Food was good. We weren't disappointed at all.  I always forget how much of a pain in the buttocks it is to peel the shrimp, but the flavors were good.
Positive	The sales rep told me two hours to install and it was exactly 2 hours. Dj Quick got my truck all hooked up. Prices are very competitive and the service was great. The sound system in my truck sounds really clean and I appreciate their hard work.
Positive	We've been here a few times, the food is always great and the pancakes are huge! Love a place who gives large portions! And their breakfast potatoes are really good, not those overly greasy shredded garbage!
Positive	I've been coming here since they opened, never had a bad experience. I recently moved and am no longer close to it, so I try and hold off on car washes until I know I'm in the neighborhood for this one. One time my son locked himself in the car while I was vacuuming, four workers helped get the car open. It was very nerve wrecking but I'm glad they are always willing to help there, and are nice on all of my visits, even when I went in to cancel my monthly subscription. Only thing I recommend to them, is to try and find a way to put signs or something on the vacuums that don't work when they are out. There are always plenty of others that work though.
Positive	"Although I didn't know there was one closer to where I was staying, I'm glad to have been at your restaurant.  Everyone was very nice - and the manager stayed on the phone with me so I wouldn't get lost again.

The food was delicious!  I will most definitely be back when in LV."
Positive	This is one of my favourite taco shops anywhere. They offer all kinds of authentic Mexican fare, and the quality is consistently top-notch. The cashiers are always friendly and helpful with selecting a menu item. I've been here maybe 5 times now, at all different times of the day and different days of the week. This place definitely deserves to be one of the top rated Mexican restaurants in the Vegas area. Enjoy!
Positive	"I came here with my husband and we sat at the bar, which we didn't mind. This place gets pretty busy, and we got there just in time before the crowd rolled in. It's a rather small and noisy restaurant and as soon as you walk in, you see the noodle man standing behind the window twisting, swinging, and hitting the noodle dough around. 

I ordered the small beef bowl while my husband opted for the large bowl. You get a choice of the thickness for your noodles - super thin, thin, thick, etc. As well as the choice of chilli sauce, onions and cilantro. 

I also order a can of herbal tea. The waiter asked me if I ever tried it and I said nope! He told me that he's not a fan of it. I still ordered it. And loved it. It tasted like the grass jelly syrup. 

Then arrived our dinner - the small bowl was more like a large bowl (surprisingly I finished it). I mixed the noodles and beef with the chilli sauce and broth and couldn't wait to dig in. It smelled amazing! The broth was tasty. The beef was tender. The noodles did not stick together and al dente. There were also three slices of radishes. All in all, it was delicious and it didn't leave me feeling thirsty after finishing the broth."
Positive	"One of the best tea places I've had...hands down! The location is off the strip, 15 mins from the airport but worth the trip.
The cashier was very knowledgeable, friendly and told us about their 100% customer satisfaction on the drinks. The worker made sure we were satisfied with our drink after trying it which is a good quality about this business! 

I had the Rose Milk Tea which was a winner in my book...even my boyfriend loved it more than his almond milk tea! 
We went during the afternoon, it was busy but lines moved incredibly fast.
Bummer that we were here on vacation but we will definitely be back soon!"
Positive	Not only our favorite restaurant in Vegas but our favorite restaurant in the world!  We ate at Giada's last night (our fourth time) and it was one of the best nights we've ever had. We had a large party (13 people) so we were seated in a private room with a balcony overlooking the strip. It was absolutely amazing. Our food was so delicious, our wait staff was very attentive and we couldn't have asked for anything more. We love Giada's!!!!
Positive	Bought a groupon for lash extensions. The place is clean and simple. Jenny was efficient and a pro at applying the lashes. They were very long lasting over a month, I loved it! I came back for a refill and will come back for my next set of extensions. Be mindful that they are a very busy clinic run by minimal staff but I was very satisfied with the results and recommend it for the quality of work
Positive	After reading all the reviews, I noticed most of the 1 stars were just from people who never even got an estimate and no on returned their call.  So all these bad reviews were just because no one returned your call?  It had nothing to do with quality of workmanship or price?  Just a 1 star because your feelings got hurt?  Another person gave a 1 star literally just off of her opinion of other reviews.  She never even called, never did anything.  Just left a 1 star.  Seems like competitors are leaving 1 stars.  Any how, Im not sure if this is the right section but I used them to renovate my pool.  It was aged.  Needed cosmetic fixes.  They sent out one of their reps named Mike.  He asked what I was looking for.  He didnt try to upsell me on things I didnt need.  He measured the pool, spoke with me about all my options, even some I never thought about, such as a wet deck and putting in stacked stone and spray deck for a more modern look.   This was not an upsell because I actually asked his opinion on how to liven up the back part of the area.  It was actually the best thing that has happened to my pool.  I spend more time on the wet deck than I actually do in the pool.  Great for that resort type feel even when you dont want to go in the pool.  Just lay in the lounge chair with water all around you.  Well worth the money.  Mike was great, very knowledgeable without being pushy or trying to push the sale.  The process took 45 days for wet deck install, new decking and plaster and tile.  Had no issues and the price was perfect.  I did get a lower bid but did some research and found out that most companies just sub out all their work.  Desert Springs used in house employees and their own equipment.  Most of these vegas companies are working out of a  work trailer just subbing out all the work.  I highly recommend getting your pool renovated with Desert Springs.  Thank you
Positive	This restaurant isn't fancy but the food is great, have a wide selection, good price, and everything made by hand and onsite. If you are looking for good food without a lot of frills I highly recommend at least checking it out.
Positive	"I'd made a reservation here for a large group (13 people) a few weeks in advance, and on the day of our meal I had to move the reservation back an hour, which they graciously accommodated. Bonus points for Lawrence.

The food was absolutely exquisite - most of the party agreed that it was the best meal many of us had had in a while. The bone-marrow tortelloni was a big hit, as well as the grilled lamb. The drinks were also on point.

Excellent experience at Lawrence. Highly recommended."
Positive	"I've been coming here for like 12 years.  I love Ann and her staff , they're always so friendly.  I get the highest quality pedicures and manicures every time I come here. I regret trying anywhere else that may be closer to my home 30 mins away. I always end up back here, and they greet me with open arms and ""fix me"".. they offer a wide variety of designs and options to get your nails done.  Prices are very competitive and you will have a salon for life."
Positive	"I like this grocery store especially for canned items, dairy, some fruit and vegetables and frozen things. This is not a good place for salads, fresh ready to eat meal items or deli meat or cheeses. You will not find Manuka honey here if you know what I mean. It caters to a more economical crowd. 

The hours are horrible. They close at 9 normally or 8 on the weekends. This isn't a suburb of Winnipeg this is downtown Toronto!!! 

STAY OPEN LATER PLEASE! Like 10PM

Countless times I have had to go all the way to Whole Foods , Longo's or Loblaws for a grocery store that is open at night."
Positive	"Came here with a large group of people (20+ people). The person who organized this dinner is good friends with the staff (including the chef), so we were treated really nicely. Appearance wise, the restaurant has a nice rustic feel to it and the patio out in the back is really relaxing. When it starts to get dark outside, the staff light up the tables with little mason jar candles and turn on hanging lights above. 

For appetizers there were an assortment of olives, peppers, squidink bread, prosciutto, shrimp (which was delicious), potatoes, fried artichoke, white fish tacos (wrapped in a lettuce wrap - which was also delicious), friend green tomatoes, croqueta, tomato salad (amazingggg!), flying fish, and a potato-cheese-sausage concoction

For dinner we had the paella negra (which is black ink paella with grilled octopus - to die for!), paella del Carmen (which is shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, chorizo, chicken and saffron paella - also delicious) 

To drink I had the white sangria which was really good. 

To sum up, I really enjoyed everything I tried and felt that all the dishes really complimented each other. The service we received was unbelievable and the chef's personal attentiveness made the experience all that much better. I'd come here again!"
Positive	"Absolutely the best place to eat ANYWHERE!!

Every time we go to Vegas (From Los angeles) we have to eat at Joe's.  It's beautiful, classy and delicious.  

To start : Dirty Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  

Appetizer : Madagascar Shrimp - You can order just one, cause it's that BIG.  We shared it as an appetizer.  Sweet and tender.  Served with a side of aoili sauce, however, I didn't hardly use it as the shrimp was so delicious.

Entree - Large stone crab; Melts right in your mouth.  You don't need any dipping sauce or butter.  The taste is pure heaven.  Steaks - All steaks are perfecto.  They are lightly seasoned and then brought to the table with a side of herbs, pepper and salt for you to drizzle over yourself.

Sides - Lyonnaise Mashed potatoes.  Oh MY Yumminess.  Creamy, buttery and cheesy.

Dessert - Peanut Butter Cream pie - Good, but VERY rich.  I could seriously only have like 3-4 big bites and I was done.

SERVICE  here is top NOTCH.  I never have to ask twice or wave anybody down.  Each table comes with a server and like 2 other staff members to help take away plates and clean up bread crumbs.

I just LOVE IT HERE SO MUCH.  I could seriously fly in for a day just to each here."
Positive	"I just moved to Madison and Saigon Noodles was an amazing find. I have been missing my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Baltimore, and Saigon Noodles made me forget all about it!

Every dish tasted remarkably fresh. The pork skin rolls had plenty of fresh mint. For dinner, I ordered the pho bo vien and my friend had the bun bo nuong. Both were delicious. I chose the large bowl ($7.45) because it was only 50 cents more than the regular bowl, not expecting to finish it. I finished off the pho, all of the mung bean sprouts and Thai basil that came with our dinners, and even wanted to drink the broth at the end! 

Although initially I was excited about the strawberry smoothie with tapioca pearls, it ended up tasting a little chalky. It had fresh fruit in it though, which was a nice touch. Next time I will try the avocado smoothie. 

Two of us had dinner, drinks, and an appetizer for under $30. What's not to like?"
Positive	"I didn't want to write a review for 850°.  I really didn't.

On the advice of friends, we checked this place out last year. What a find!  We've been a few times now and the reluctance to review was purely selfish. We didn't want it to become too popular and cause us to have to wait for a table. 

Last week, You Gotta Eat Here aired and featured 850°.  We saw the episode and thought 'here we go! It'll be impossible to get in now.' So, we popped in on Monday this week, later in the evening. Thanks to it being a rainy Monday night, there were plenty of tables. 

First off, love the funky, relaxed decor. Second, the service is always top notch. Our server was fantastic - attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly.

Then there's the food. Admittedly, we stick to pizza and wine. Every pizza we've tried has been incredible. Some of the best Neapolitan style crust and sauce we've had. Fresh,  mostly local toppings, and the Canadian themes are inspired. We don't have a favourite, we have about 6!

On top of this, their Ontario wine selection is ideal.  Where else can you get a couple of perfect (in our humble opinion) pizzas and a bottle of wine for $60-$70? 

Great addition to the south Etobicoke neighbourhood!!"
Positive	"The food was good.  Not the best but it was a nice lunch.

That sticky tofffee pudding is amazing. 
The Hell's Kitchen Burger was spicy and delicious
Butter chicken was whatever
Scotch egg is a must try
Sausage rolls are just ok"
Positive	"I love this place, it's my go-to when I'm hungry at the fashion show mall and I don't wanna pay for over priced food for no reason.

Everything is fresh made to order, I always get the chipotle wrap on a tomato basil tortilla.  It's like one big fat short burrito cut in two.  Their a little skimpy on the fries but that's ok. The fries are just like hooters curly fries and go great with their little Tapatio packets they give you.

Next time you're in Fashion Show mall, just think... Non-dollar-menu items at Wendy's, or Great Wraps? Great Wraps!!"
Positive	This bar is tucked away from the main stream pubs. If you are visiting Toronto and would like a spot that's off the beaten path this is a great option. Very chill and quaint atmosphere. The bar is on the smaller side,so probably wouldn't be suitable for a really large crowd. It's great for an intimate date or drinks with a friend. Definitely check it out!
Positive	Sunday morning I was in the mood for Mexican food.  Not being from the area I turned to my trusty YELP.  The reviews looked promising and I have rarely been steered wrong by the fellow yelpers.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole and they were really good.  The other items on the menu also look good and I will definitely be back.
Positive	"Lawrence has been on my list of go-to's for a long, long time. When my parents came to town for a visit, I decided that it would be the perfect opportunity to try Sunday brunch at Lawrence. My initial excitement was dampened a little when we arrived and the hostess said we would have to wait for 45 minutes. We decided to tough it out and walk around the area until we got our table. In the end, we only had to wait 15 minutes. 

As per former Yelp reviews, we started off with scones and donuts. The scones had blackcurrants with cream, jam and butter on the side. It was quite good but I do agree with another reviewer who said the scone should have been served warm. The donuts were quite tasty - Lemon, vanilla and chocolate. 

To eat we ordered three different dishes: 
1. Pig's trotter with soft boiled eggs, anchovy and root veggies (parsnips, carrots, potatoes) - Amazing flavours in this one. The pig's trotter was tender, fatty and flavourful with a good mix of root veggies. I can also really appreciate a properly cooked soft-boiled egg. 
2. Scrapple with eggs and bacon - From the waitress' description, we expected the scrapple to have a little but more meat. It seemed more like a fried square of cornmeal and aside from the desirable crispiness, the inside wasn't that great. The sunnyside eggs were perfect and the bacon was well-cooked. 
3. Kedgeree - The curry rice was mixed with flaked haddock and soft-boiled eggs. The dish was incredibly complex in flavour - Fragrant, a little spicy with an unexpected sour taste at the end. 

All in all, the flavour combinations for brunch are very unique and worth a shot for sure. I'd recommend going right at 10 to avoid waiting for a table. Next time I'd probably go for the apple cinnamon french toast (looked unreal at the next table) and the deviled kidneys. 

Enjoy!"
Positive	Being new to Pilates I was searching for the most qualified and best trained instructor. From my first private session with Shelley at Sage Pilates I knew I found her! Working with Shelley has changed me physically but also has motivated me. The studio is immaculate and the equipment is state of the art, the atmosphere is uplifting yet calm. Shelley really knows her stuff!  She is certified in Stott Pilates and is also an experienced licensed physical therapist who works with each person based on their physical abilities. She makes her private sessions and classes enjoyable and highly beneficial. Whether you are new to pilates or advanced this is the studio and instructor you want!
Positive	"I just finished a hair extensions course at ""Jessica Hair"", and can tell everyone that she is an amazing teacher! Jessica is very knowledgeable and patient. She explains every step, answers any questions,shows how to do the extensions in a perfect way, and provides her students with lots of useful advise and helpful tips. If you ask me, should I recommend her to anyone? I would definitely say yes without any doubts. Im very impressed with her ability to deliver the material in such an interesting and respectful way when you are treated as a professional, and not as a student. She shares her experience and you can feel her support every minute. Sweetest and honest person I have ever met!Jessica is the best teacher I have had in my life!"
Positive	Excellent is all I can say .  Loved it and definitely will come back.  Price is very reasonable compared to other fancy steak places.  Meat was well cooked and delicious.  Hint, go there hungry !! Also staff was great but way too accommodating -- tone it down a little, too many managers and assistant managers kept asking and asking and asking how was the food.  Let us eat in peace.  Enuf said.
Positive	Sunday Brunch is amazing, all you can eat and margarita, mimosa & bloody mary bar for $12.99 a person. Food is updates fresh pretty often, made to order omelettes and options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. Best deal in town, dug the 90s playlist too!
Positive	Delicious and fresh tasting!! Great location. The Hawaiian Tuna is my favorite so far but can't wait to taste more next time. Staff was friendly and helpful. So excited to have a new poke place close to my house!
Positive	You would think that all chatimes taste the same, but that is not the case. This location is actually the only one I'd confidently say always have the same quality in taste, and the tapioca's never hard (yes i'm thinking of you, location at VIP Markham cinemas). Roasted milk tea is always my go to, as i think that's what's different about Chatime compared with all the other bubble tea chains. I must admit though, since The Alley has opened up in the same plaza, I've frequented Chatime a little less. However, out of all  Chatimes i've been to (dundas/commerce gate/finch location), this is the best one!
Positive	"Came here for dinner before the crazy nightclub hours began, and it was a good experience. Our food was good, seasoned well but not overdone, ingredients were fresh and satisfied us all. I highly recommend the MACHO NACHOS, very good nachos, I loved them.

It is a bit on the loud side, but that's not a deal breaker and it's not too loud to make you annoyed. I did not stay for the late hours dancing/music scene they have, that's not my thing, but for those who dig it...go nuts.

A solid place to eat and drink, it's certainly worth a try! Check it out."
Positive	"Came here last Thursday night for the 10:00 PM showing. I was visiting Vegas for the first time with a friend, and she got us the tickets. We had great seats! Front row right hand side. 

O was like any other Cirque show, in that it is hard to give them anything but glowingly positive reviews. The show is an experience, and you are happy to be there.

I have now been to 4 Cirque shows, and O stands out as the most visually stunning. The art design and set, trump any of the other shows I have seen, even if the acrobatics, and other acts are not as spectacular.

The opening scene, and the whole experience, was stunning, and drew me in to a beautiful realm of intrigue and magic. I even got teary eyed. I really enjoyed going to this show, and consider it an experience that I am glad to have had.

Definitely check out one of the most spectacular Cirque shows around.

Any Cirque show you see becomes a magical and memorable experience."
Positive	It was behind a Mortuary off 48th street and Indian School for decades before it moved to the last location.  You think it was good then, You should have seen it before in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  It left that location just after Thanksgiving in 1994, although it wasn't called the Monastery at that point as there was a fight between all the owners.  The Monastery had relocated around '91/92 or so.  The party was pretty much over after that.
Positive	This is a new location for me. I really enjoyed it. The massage was average, but the welcoming reception we (hubs and I) received from the staff was so amazing. I am POSITIVE no other location serves their clients like this one. I have a membership and will be visiting this location again and again.
Positive	"Although I felt a bit claustrophobic by the tight parking spaces and narrow entrance in the lot that connects Pawn Donuts and Coffee with the infamous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (from the show that's on tv), once I bit into the donut holes I immediately was glad we'd decided to venture in. We'd eaten lunch moments before at El Sombrero and my hubby wanted a donut. We said O Face, then I thought, let's try something new. SO glad we did. These are probably the best donuts I have ever had, or at least in a long, long, long time. We got the assortment of donut holes, named Holey Moley (a couple glazed, a couple powdered and one red velvet and one chocolate).  Super delicious, the dense, moist cake donut with sugary, slightly crunchy glaze was perfect. We also got an apple fritter which was outstanding, lovely chunks of cinnamon apple in a yeasty, puffy fritter, again, not too much or too little sugary glaze. 
There goes my clean eating 2016 resolution. O'well."
Positive	"I have an entire box of conversation hearts left over from Valentine's Day and these little morsels are going to be the inspiration for this review. Let the taste of cherry flavored death and pastel sidewalk chalk begin!

""My man"" and I decided to join a group of ten at C4 last night to enjoy the company of a quirky group of ""romeo""s and ""dream girl""s and sample the new Southwest inspired menu at C4.

I was impressed at ""how nice"" the decor was in the main dining area, since I had previously only frequented the bar and sampled some of the wretched Japanese inspired bar food. It's nice to see a restaurant ""wise up"" and invest a little ""tlc"" into reworking its image, as well as its menu. I thought that the bold, colorful Mexican centerpieces and hanging crystal light pieces were ""tres chic"" and when I saw the same strong use of color duplicated on the chair backs it was ""true love"" for me. I wanted to steal all the light fixtures, knick-knacks and tall chairs for my own home.

It was Valentine's Day and I had to order something to drink that was as frou frou and girly as my polka dot party dress, because when ""ur a qt"" you simply have to be sipping something just as ultra-femme. So I went for the Prickly (pear) Peach Martini and was not disappointed by its ""sweet,"" pulpy, hot pink contents.

For apps, we ordered two platters of the tri-colored chips with three dips and the crab cakes. When it came to the dips, there was ""one I love""d, the napolito corn salsa. The other two, guacamole and pico de gallo, ""I hope"" get better with time because the pico was bland and the guacamole was so overpowered by lime juice that it was nigh on inedible. The crab cakes on the other hand ""I'm sure"" I would order again because there was a good crab to filler ratio and a pleasant spicy kick delivered by the chipotle remoulade. 

""Lover boy"" and I split the bacon cheeseburger and the chorizo mac and cheese for dinner, both of which I wanted to be ""all mine"" because they were so good I didn't want to share a single bite with ""my baby."" I was hoping the burger would ""be good"" but I wasn't expecting it to be cooked to perfection and served with crisp tomatoes and a lovely pile of spring mix instead of some of the more lowly greens available. It also came with a side of fries that were more like munching on a plank of potato if you ""ask me."" And feel free to ""call me"" crazy, but they must have sprinkled ""stardust"" on the chorizo mac and cheese because it was out of this world good! You could ask any of the three people that ordered it at our table if that's too good to ""be true"" and I'm sure you'd receive the same response as mine. Spicy, tender homemade chorizo was afloat in three types of decadent cheesy bliss!

We ended the night with two dessert sampler platters, and if you have more than at least three people at the table, I highly suggest you take ""time out"" of your evening to indulge because it was ""way"" good. I am in ""love"" with two of the desserts in specific, the frozen key lime tart and the Mexican chocolate flourless cake. The key lime tart was ""cool"" and citric and I let it melt in my mouth like a bite of sorbet with a graham cracker crust and tasty little candied lime zest. The ""cutie pie"" slice of Mexican chocolate flourless cake was rich and dense with a deep cocoa flavor and a hint of spiciness at the end that ""let it be"" a bit more unpredictable and memorable than regular chocolate desserts. The borracho bread pudding wasn't as drunk as its name suggested (or as pudding-y) and the 7 layer chocolate cake was the same ""you & me"" could get the valley over. 

The waitress we had was an ""angel."" She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes on the menu and went so far as to open a dialogue with the chef when a member of our party needed a vegetarian, lactose free meal (who could that possibly be? "":)"" ). I ""loved her,"" and even though service was a little bit scattered, I attribute that more to having to deal with drink orders and food delivery at the same time (for a pretty big group) than any kind of slacking. It wasn't perfect and could definitely use some refining, but since that was the only minor hang-up in the evening, I'm going to ""let it be"" forgotten.

""I do"" think C4 has the possibility of becoming a five star dining experience. It just needs a bit of polishing!

Don't agree? ""Fax me."" (Sorry, I just had to include the most ridiculously out of date conversation heart saying in the history of Necco. The rest of them were just too ordinary.)"
Positive	Great spot.   The atmosphere is chic and open.  The food is fresh and flavorful.   Our larger group tried a bit of everything.  Ask if the have any whole fried fish left.  They go quickly!  Drunken beef, Pad Thai, papaya salad, short ribs....all delicious!
Positive	Great decor, fun staff food is good i love being able to see an open kitchen to see what is going on, if your ever at the jack check them out. Small menu selection but good choices.
Positive	"I went here for my birthday and it was maybe the 4th time we had been there. It was nice as usual. The only downfall I would say is paying $5 for a glass of orange juice. The ""cup of bread"" is delicious. I usually get the chicken, avo, spinach egg white omelette. It is usually very good, but the last few times the avocado was hard and tasted weird. It might just be out of season. Otherwise, this is a great place to eat breakfast!"
Positive	"We've been taking our dogs here for 12 years, before the move into the new facility. 6 dachshunds and a corgi have been trusted to these vets and let me tell you I trust no one else but them to handle our precious fur babies! 
Everyone from the receptionists, to techs to vets make sure you and your pup feel comfortable and welcome! 
I recommend Oasis to anyone with precious loved ones, you will not regret it!"
Positive	I can't get enough of Dutch Bros.  I'm glad they finally opening more locations in AZ.  You can't beat the deals and friendly staffs.  I love the Kahula Kicker and Annihilator.  Must try!
Positive	"This place is amazing. I'm used to staying on the strip so I was a little skeptical, but I am happy we stayed there.  We liked it so much we extended our stay 2 nights.

I really can't find anything negative at all about this place.  The restaurants are great, and the casino isn't overcrowded like the one on the strip.

The rooms there are top notch.  Simply amazing.

Definitely making a trip back there"
Positive	What's not to love! Anything and everything you could possibly need can be found here. Something for all budgets and many eating options after you burn calories cruising the tri-level structure. Many restaurant options in walking distance as well if you can't find something internally.
Positive	"I've been hearing nothing but positive things about The Olde Yorke's fish and chips, and yet it wasn't until a few days ago that I finally got to check the place out for myself.

We arrived around 5:00 on a weekday and the place wasn't exactly packed. We were shown to a cozy booth by the bar and I began perusing the menu, although I already knew I wanted some variety of fish and chips. I'm far from a connoisseur of this fried specialty, so I just decided to order the first option on the menu: Cod & Chips (""Moist & flaky, a British & Newfoundland favourite, served with coleslaw"").

It arrived a short time later and was undeniably delicious. The big, freshly-friend chunk of cod was cooked really well, although the fish itself was perhaps just a little overdone (i.e. it was flakier than you might expect). The fries were also quite tasty, while the coleslaw hit the spot.

I did find it unusual that the dish didn't come with tartar sauce, and when I asked for some, I only got a tiny take-out container of the stuff. It was definitely not enough for my preference."
Positive	I love the whole atmosphere here. So luxurious & glam! Makes you feel super pampered & important. It's the little things that make the service amazing like the smell throughout the lounge, the blanket they offer while you're getting your lashes done, the comfy chairs, everything is done with such professionalism. Maizy is my lash girl & she's is the sweetest & listens to my needs! Love it here!
Positive	When you first walk into Umji (in English, Thumbs Up), you don't really expect much. The interior and exterior decorating is a little underwhelming- just very simple, even a little run-down looking. However, you're greeted by a cute and friendly Korean family and you're either seated by a young man or a middle aged woman (so probably a mom/aunt with her son?) and you get a feel that it's a family run business. The restaurant instantly feels cozy and intimate, haha. The food was incredible and inexpensive- had the pork bone soup and the side dishes were one of the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm a Korean food fanatic so this is saying a lot. Would definitely recommend and try again :)
Positive	Great place for burgers, fries and a shake. The food is fast and fresh and delicious. You get your own condiments and soda/water, but they bring the food and the shakes to your table. You can sit anywhere you want. Highly recommend
Positive	"If you're craving some Mediterranean food, Istanbul Mediterranean will definitely satisfy your craving!

Although it's just like a stand in a market area near Bally's, the food was ON POINT. I had a chicken pita and they stuff it so much that you definitely get a bang for your buck. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and they customize the toppings as per your request. Ask for extra spicy sauce if you can take the heat! They also have a bowl option where the toppings are put on top of rice for a few extra bucks. 

Also, get a free bottled drink when you check in on yelp! I just went for a water bottle but that's the most satisfying on a hot day.

Although the service is a little slow, the food is delicious, relatively inexpensive, and satisfying. Can't go wrong! It also makes for some great drunk food lol."
Positive	Love this place! Previously eaten at their Pebble location, which is just as tasty. It's nice to have some new dishes when it comes to breakfast spots and all awesome ingredients which is a big plus for me. Friendly staff, good food. Boom.
Positive	"This was my 3rd visit at this location.  Service is always on point: prompt and friendly.   Food as well.  Delivered in time, tasteful, and visually appealing.  
However, tonight was the first time ordering the guac and chips.   First impression: overpriced.  The amount equated to what I think was less than a cup.  Normally that wouldn't be bad for PURE guac.  This guac, though with good taste, is full of fillers: corn, bacon, pumpkin seeds.  There is no possible way to pair each tortilla chip with some guac.  The chips outnumber it.  Would I order it again?  Nope!  Not for $11.50"
Positive	Today was the 1st time that i enjoyed Rito's at the Surprise location.  I usually get take out from their downtown location.  I will say that Surprise did not disappoint.  The green chile burrito enchilada style was on point. So so good.  Everything is so fresh. Helen was very nice.  My family and i will be back.  it is great to have this food on the Westside.
Positive	This place is probably one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  The ambiance is gorgeous, a very beautiful atmosphere, perfect for any form of celebration.  The service was top notch, everything was prompt, accurate and cohesive.  The standard of service was fantastic.  We started off with the escargot, and stuff calamari; both were great! Then I had the Veal for dinner, and my girlfriend had the Trout, again both were great! We ended the night with their signature desserts the beignets and a cappuccino.  It really was the perfect evening, I would highly recommend this spot.
Positive	"I have been going to Yolie's since the mid 90's - when tradeshow crowds dictated a 1+ hr wait.  I haven't been there for several years - and was a bit concerned based on some of the recent reviews on Yelp.  So I took my wife here this weekend for her first Yolie's experience.  It was just as I remembered it!

The staff was VERY friendly - getting our Caipirinha orders out quickly, to accompany the bread and salsa that is served.  

I knew better than to order anything OTHER than the special - all you can eat meat!  

We feasted upon chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sirloin, tri-tip, porl loin, sausage, and lamb.  The waiter was bringing it as fast as we could eat it - and we were offered as much as we could possibly take.

I am still a bit puzzled as to how some folks say that they were denied meat?  If anything, they could use the red/green cards used at many of the chain Brazilian places (all a copy of Yolie's!).  We passed on several rounds of meat, but as soon as we asked for something, it was on our plate within seconds.

Granted, this is not a glitzy place that you go to for the ambience.  But Yolie herself has always greets me, along with her very gregarious Italian head waiter (I never learned his name).  

I will always choose Yolie's over any of the big hotel's or chains that are present in Vegas."
Positive	"Singh Meadows is one of South Scottsdale/Tempe's hidden gems. Beautiful farmers market, restaurant/coffee shop and greenbelt. Mr. Singh makes every visit personal, like you're coming home to family, as does his extraordinary staff. If you haven't been, it's a must try, and once you do, it will become part of your ""must do"" weekend outings. Great place for families (including fur-babies) to relax and enjoy the day."
Positive	"Love this place for crepe cones!  I try a new flavor each time and none of them fail to be good. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Crepe rolled up with toppings and ice cream like a waffle cone -only soft, not hard like waffle cones.  They use Thrifty ice cream with 20 flavors to choose.

If crepes are not your favorite, they have waffles and smoothies as well.

Enjoy!"
Positive	Cheryl was our waitress; a pure delight.  We had a nice breakfast.  Everything was fresh and the coffee cups are huge.  We shared the deuces which was 2 sausage, 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes.  Pancakes were light and fluffy and the rest of the meal cooked perfectly.
Positive	"I don't like hot dogs much but if you smother it Palookaville Texas Beef Chili, fresh jalepenos and cheese--I will eat the heck outta that delicious mess. 

Wow. 

I didn't know I could eat a chili dog that fast. Really, really, really, good food here, people. You can tell everything is made fresh with great ingredients and love. And it doesn't end with the chili. That apple slaw is crunchy, tart, spicy goodness. It's so light and clean. Then there's the tasty cornbread with a hint of cinnamon--creative and delish!

I absolutely love the chill atmosphere of this place too. A cheap, delicious, laid-back meal when you're biking around town or not in the mood to cook dinner. And you can bring in your own beer, too! I mean, is there a greater compliment to spicy chili than barley pop? I think not. 

The owner is so frickin' nice too! What a great new local business in the area."
Positive	My service org was able to go play (about 20 of us) all together. We all had a blast! They newly installed a basketball hoop and I ended up playing with my friends for hours. There are a lot of multiplayer and rhythm-type games, which are my favorite. The employees are always willing to lend a hand, whether it be with changing games or teaching you to play the game. I'll definitely be back and I recommend this place over any of the bigger names! Thank you!
Positive	I don't know why everyone rates this place low. It's a fast food joint with a bunch of teenagers workin. Of course they dont care. It's a bunch of underpaid people working very hard all day. I went threw drive threw and the girl sounded pretty tired. Probably because she's gets paid min wage I'm guessing. It's all good though I got food and it was fine. People are stupid. Just cook your own food if your gonna complain.
Positive	"Only stopped by the bar for a drink, so don't have much to comment on.
Good prices on beer, great service.
Pickle fries are a MUST!  Fried pickles, but the spears have been cut thinner so they are easier to eat!
Was loud as roller coaster loading/unloading station was right above bar."
Positive	I honestly don't understand any of the bad reviews. This place was not only SO KIND to us, but they washed my car so well!! And they recommended what they can do for next time we come. I'm definitely coming back here. Thanks!
Positive	"I am not really an Abba fan, my husband is, but I like good entertainment.  I really enjoyed this event.  Went to the 5:30 show, it was not filled so they moved us up.  Started on time, could see from anywhere in the theater.  The whole show was very, very good, music amazing, singing great, costumes neat.  I would recommend anyone seeing this musical that likes good entertainment, not just Abba fans.  I would go again if I could.  I am a Henderson resident, saw Phantom twice when they were here.
The finale was unexpected and really something.  Loved it!!!!"
Positive	"The pho broth here is 100% better than any of the other places in North York, but they don't do pho with fresh noodles (which is how I like it myself).

But the broth......YUM! 

I can also say it's probably the cleanest, and nicest pho restaurant around the area, it's not as noisy as Vietnamese Delight, and its a much nicer dining experience than Pho88.

If it's a date, and you both want Pho, come here!"
Positive	"After 20 plus years, this is still an impressive property and casino! 
The HRH has expanded, remodeled and updated itself a lot during this time. Restaurants and bars have come and gone (RIP, original Center Bar). During a recent visit here, we had dinner at Culinary Dropout, a drink at Center Bar then some debauchery at Magic Mike Live! 

Among my favorites here are outdoor dining at Culinary Dropout, gaming at Goose Island Pub and hanging out at Center Bar. The casino has had some great gaming promos lately, such as 10x points on bartop machines on select days/times. I've participated in this a few times, and the points show up as you play! Genius. Club 45 (Classic Rockers Club) has a weekly point promo of 5,000 bonus points for 100 points earned. You can do this 4 times during that day! 
I don't know of any other casino that has an ""oldies"" players club that starts at age 45. 
Promos like this will keep me coming back to the HRH!"
Positive	I ABSOLUTELY love the sanctuary!  I went there with a good friend, and have introduced others to this sanctuary.  I love seeing what good they do, and how well the animals are cared for Being able to bring treats for the birds (raw, unsalted nuts!) is a plus.  I wish there were a way to virtually adopt, so that I could contribute regularly and receive a little information about my favorites.
Positive	Best acaí bowl I've ever had by far. All the staff is very friendly and helpful when deciding what to eat and will give you their honest opinions of their favorite foods! The portions here are much bigger than other Poke restaurants at the same price. Overall a wonderful place to eat!
Positive	"This place is really, really good. Quite possibly the best falafel in Charlotte! I have eaten here many times, and my vegetarian parents love the food as well. Here are my top three recommendations:

Best meaty option: MIX PLATTER   $12.99
Gyro + chicken kabob skewer + shish kafta skewer OR beef kabob skewer, two choice of side and tzatziki.

Best veggie option: MEZZA PLATTER   $10.99
Hummus, babaganoush, tabouli, grape leaves OR falafel and potato harra with tzatziki sauce

Best light veggie option: FALAFEL WRAP   $4.99
Homemade falafel topped with salad and tahini sauce
and wrapped on pita bread.

This place is the real deal! Come inside if you want to catch some Arabic soap operas (yes), and drink some really legitimate tea followed by really legitimate baklava!"
Positive	This place is a shining beacon of deliciousness. I was both delighted and surprised by the unique (pickled cherries) and balanced dishes. It's in an unassuming strip mall and if you were thinking Ruth's Chris or Paul Martin's (nearby) - I ask you to reconsider and come here!
Positive	A real short walk from Caesar's Hotel, a beautiful restaurant, great food, very good service. Nobody makes French Fries like the French! And it was very reasonably priced for Las Vegas. I would definitely go back again. I'm very critical of restaurants (not in a mean way) and I won't write bad reviews, or mediocre reviews. This is a great place. Wish I was there right now :)
Positive	"Everyone knows what Sheetz is and if you don't, you're missing out.

I love the food, I love the service, but the only complaint I have are the crazies that show their face at all hours of the night. I mean, I know crazies have to eat, but I wish they wouldn't murder me with their eyes.

Sometimes it just kills my appetite."
Positive	The guy who works there is always happy and friendly. Been here multiple times and never disappointed. The absolute best place to get black sesame ice cream. My go to dessert place when im in the area
Positive	"Their food is AMAZING. Talk about a happy tummy! The price point are good and super affordable for such flavor and so much of the food in a serving!!!

Better than Rollin' Smoke ;)"
Positive	First time to What's  Crackin. Seated right away, glad we picked outdoor seating. Nice and roomy. The cocktails are well priced and yummy. I ordered the Monte Cristo big portion  the fries are hand cut and were great. Will definitely go back. Service was good there was a gentleman worker or owner going to different tables to check on guests
Positive	"Try to come here when it's half off, it feels so good when you get that bill and see that tiny number. You may have to wait but it is so worth. I've had a few things here that I'll go over and rate. 

Frozen strawberry margarita is super huge and delicious - 4/5
Mad mex burrito is nice, it is simple and just has beans and rice cheese and meat inside. I had chicken in mine which was good. The tortilla is kinda lame. It is pretty good, and rather large, but not mind blowing or anything - 3/5
Nachos with chicken were SOOOO good, you get so much stuff, the chips are crunchy and yummy and it comes with cheese, chicken, and ... I don't know what else honestly but it was good. I did ask the waiter if there was anything spicy on it and skipped the jalapenos, but I believe the tomatoes or the guac was too much for me so I scraped it off. And then I kept eating. 4.5/5
I also had the wing-o tacos. I mistakenly came here with my friend once when it was not half off, so I was missing that TINY BILL HIGH that is a large part of the reason I come here. The tacos are not normally half off so I decided to try them. Anyways, these are tacos with some boneless wings in them. I got them because they come with some JERSEY CHIPS on the side, which you will understand later in my review. I had a hard time picking the sauce for the wings because they all sounded very not my thing. I settled on the southwestern wings and asked my server how the heat level at a mild level would be and she said there would be none. Well, once again, I am a huge baby who should not trust my server and they were too much for me. The sauce also had a bit of a ranchy taste which I hate. It was kinda lame, there wasn't much to it so it just tasted like I had some large pieces of meat with a sauce I didn't like wrapped in thin, soggy tortillas. 2/5

Finally, I will dedicate a whole paragraph to Mad Mex and their jersey chips. You get a huge basket of waffle fries which are perfectly fried - super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like to ask for ketchup with mine. Seriously, these are literally the best fries I have ever had. If you're just here with your buddies and you don't like Mexican food just get two orders of these. If you're not sure what to get, just get two orders of these. If you're getting something already, get an order of this to complement your meal. If you think you ordered enough and can't eat it all, but have not ordered these jersey chips, then you should still order them. A trip to Mad Mex is meaningless if you do not have jersey chips. I would even consider paying full price for the jersey chips (jk haha that wouldn't happen) I will give these fries an easy 10/5.

GET THE JERSEY CHIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive	We love Glamour Pets! Every time we go in, the staff is always so friendly and they make me feel comfortable and safe leaving my dog Khloe there in their care! The prices are fair for what you get, they do an amazing job!
Positive	I'm from the south and so am VERY picky about fried chicken. Lo Lo's chicken is sooo good! Juicy, crispy, and seasoned just right. I had fried okra, grits, and cornbread which were all amazing. We ate there for Sunday brunch and stuffed ourselves so much that we didn't eat the rest of the day! The service was great as well. No complaints! I was just visiting Phoenix and wish we had a Lo Lo's in Denver.
Positive	I love this place. Stephanie is by far the very best at what she does. As a registered nurse she is a true professional with all of her skin care services. She's honest and will explain everything in such understanding terms. She also offers some fantastic skin care products. The staff is also terrific and it's such a welcoming, kind and clean environment. I have also seen Dr Honing in this office for stomach issues and bio identical hormone replacement therapy. He has extensive knowledge in this area. He listens and is very patient and thorough with his explanations of treatment. I have referred numerous friends here and everyone has been extremely happy with their skin care treatments and the HRT services of Dr. Honing. I would HIGHLY recommend them and I truly thank them for their help throughout the years.
Positive	"Such a pleasant surprise.  Recommended to us by Indian friends as the best in Pittsburgh.  

Authentic Indian cuisine, great deals!!! nice service, strong flavors, very fresh.  Even love the wall art!  Second visit just as satisfying as the first.  We'll be back for more dosas/ sambar/ coconut chutney soon.  

Thank you Tandoor"
Positive	"I came here with my friend two months ago to get our hair curled for prom. Laura was our stylist and she was absolutely lovely. Personally, I'm a very chatty person and she was very good at keeping up the conversation. My friend and I showed her pictures of what we wanted and she definitely delivered. We were so impressed that we ended up talking about how amazing she was the entire car ride to prom. The next time I need to get my hair styled or cut, I'm going to book and appointment here, and ask for Laura of course. 

Another bonus: They gave us water in wine glasses! Ha. Super cute. Grateful Head knows how to take care of their customers."
Positive	I got the gold standard burger and my boyfriend got the rising sun burger. Two best burgers we've ever eaten in our lives. This place is freaking amazing! I will absolutely be going back next time I'm in Vegas.
Positive	"If you're planning on being in Vegas any time soon and you've been having trouble finding a bartender who could make you that exotic drink you've been searching all over for... then search no more.

Stop by the Bar Vdara at the Vdara hotel and ask for Antonio. He's probably the most worldly bartender I've run into. Ever. And quite nice to look at too :-)

He'll run all the way to the kitchen and back with an egg for the Pisco Sour you're wanting. Yes, he uses real egg whites. And he makes it to perfection. The flavor of the pisco isn't lost and it's definitely not sweet, but not bitter either. I marveled at the fact that he even knew what a Pisco Sour was.

And whilst discussing the history of this cocktail's origin with my work friend, another woman came up and ordered a Negroni and swore that he made the best Negroni she's ever had.

So - go to Bar Vdara, ask for Antonio, and ask for the exotic you've been craving forever. Chances are, he can make it. And the regular stuff too.

If I could have, I would have tucked him in my luggage case and taken him home with me! Tell him the cute little Asian girl that likes pisco sour sent you :-)

Oh, and a big plus because the bar is non-smoking!"
Positive	Took the stress out of moving! My brother who normally helps me move was out of town this time, so I gave these guys a call. Im glad I did! Mike and Kyle arrived at my house exactly on time, at 12pm, I was in my new house ready to relax, with all of the furniture in place, within a couple of hours. Mike and Kyle were awesome and did a great job, I would recommend these guys to anyone who needs help moving, made my life so much easier. Thanks guys!
Positive	I must say I had hesitation with this choice by my warranty company.  The poor reviews...but I remember each person should make their own opinion.  This company was courteous with each contact. They made an appointment for me in the morning for a same day visit.  I was given a large estimate time 'window' 4pm-9pm 7/6/18.  When I explained I am a senior and heat extra hard on me they marked it as a 'rush'.  I thanked them for the consideration and hoped for the best. The office gals even called a couple times to check in with updates-- then a pleasant surprise-David rang my bell around 4:15 p.m.  So pleased to have been on the front end of time estimate.  David was very thorough explaining as he went along.  I had purchased my condo last Sept.  and really had no idea the age of the a/c unit.   He said the unit was 8 or so years old and appeared in good shape.  He recommended a small part that might prevent the sporadic problem I had been having for the last week.  The part was covered by warranty company.  I am very happy with David and everyone I dealt with at Ideal Services.  Thank you.
Positive	"Been to a few different Babystacks around town. The one closest to me is less than a mile down the road from where I live, off Buffalo and Flamingo. There are a couple other good places to check out in this little strip mall area including 'Komex' and 'Off The Hook'.

Service and food are consistent between here and the two other locations I have been in. It is a Filipino-Hawaiian influenced cafe. I noticed the big set of wooden knife, spoon, and fork hanging on the wall (a favorite wall hanging in many Filipino homes). 

My favorite is Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice platter. I usually add one of their signature pancakes (usually the red velvet pancakes). I have sat at their dining bar when I am alone as well as at a table with family/friends. Staff is always friendly and efficient. Food comes out in a timely manner. Wait time can vary depending on time of day. We have waited as long as 20 minutes. (Please note, when you reserve a table, your entire party must be present in order to be seated).

The place is usually busy no matter which location I have gone to but wait times have been tolerable or move quickly. All in all, a great place to have breakfast/brunch whether ny yourself or with friends/family."
Positive	Kenny and staff continue to give me excellent service.  Whenever I have an issue, I will text or email Kenny.  I normally get a written response within a short period of time.  My concerns are always addressed.  Appreciate the 2-3 days advance notice when they will arrive.
Positive	This bike shop is convenient, great selection of Specialized and Cannondale bikes, many more brands. They always have stuff out on the sidewalk, you can ride those bad boys. More, no, most importantly, they serve beer and wine and have growlers that attach to your bike. That is next level.
Positive	"I enjoy the idea of the nice little family restaurant on the first floor and a bar in the first room, a second floor bar and high tops with a little dance floor and Dj on weekends. The crowd is is pretty relaxed and there are many TVs throughout the restaurant. The second floor had a Cali theme to it, with a long board as a drink sign, the palms on the bar roof, a wooden balcony and garage door Windows to open when it's warmer out.
   We sat at a high top on the second floor. It was quite crowded, resulting in a wait to get a server of 10 minutes. The menu has plenty of food to choose from. This made it harder to choose what to eat! But as soon as we put our order in, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our food to come out. The server was very nice and ended up being very attentive throughout our meal.
  We ordered the Reuben and fries, also comes in a sea food version, a regular cheese burger and fries, a firecracker app (stuffed fried flour tortillas with chicken, roasted tomatoes corn, black bean salsa served with pico de gallo and sour cream), and a steak salad (with tender steak, fries, iceburg lettuce, and blue cheese, however ordered ranch to come with it). The fries were my favorite type, crispy and not flimsy!
   The over all experience was not bad. I will like to come back again and try out the downstairs dining room with the kids and see how that turns out!"
Positive	"We had a delicious dinner here.  We came because of a Groupon voucher, but we'll be back when we are looking for an extraordinary dinner treat!  

We had an early dinner reservation (first ones in the restaurant that night!) and were greeted at the door by the chef.  We were there on a Wednesday - not a typical day for people to eat dinner out, but the restaurant was about a third full by the time we left.

Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  The wine selection was very extensive.  It's a small restaurant with an intimate feel.  The décor is very nice - very interesting pictures on the wall, which sparked interesting table conversation.  

They had quite a few specials for appetizers and dinner.  The menu didn't have any steak options, which is my preference, so I was trying to figure out what I would order for my main.  But then the waiter mentioned several steak specials, including - mmmmm - beef wellington. Sign me up!

For appetizers I ordered Baked Cheese in Phyllo and my husband ordered Crab cakes (special). For dinner I ordered the Baked Wellington (special) and my husband had the Grilled Rack of Lamb Chops. 

The baked cheese came in a 'treasure-bag pouch' of creamy cheese on top of salad/fruit. The dressing was delicious, and the combination of the cheese with the salad and dressing was incredible.  I ate every bite.  The crab cakes were lightly crisp, dense served with an unbelievable sauce.

When my husband got his lamb chops, he took a bite, and said it was good.  The second bite he dipped in the sauce, and his eyes got big.  I had a similar experience with my beef wellington.  All of our dishes were of excellent quality, but it was the combination with the chef's sauces that turned them into culinary treats.  If there hadn't been so many people around us at that point, I think we might have licked our dishes clean!

They have desserts, although for some reason they aren't on the online menu. My husband had the crème brulee with fruit.  I had the chocolate venetian pate (I think I'm remembering that name right) which was dark and white chocolate with pistachios and another delicious sauce.  My chocolate dish was described as 'denser than fudge' and the waiter said it was one of the chef's signature dishes.  It was very good, as was crème brulee - carmelized perfectly.  

One word of caution on the bathrooms - they have pictures that are supposed to represent male/female.  My husband said he stood in front of the doors for a minute trying to figure out which was which. I was sure when I used the bathroom that I had picked the female figure, but when I came out there was a gentleman waiting so one of us got it wrong. (LOL!)

One thing we would advise management - review your bench seating.  Some of the tables have benches.  When I first sat down I was so low it felt like the table was at my breastbone.  I switched to the chair and my 6'4"", long-backed husband moved to the bench.  The table was at an appropriate height for him, but he said he felt like his knees were in his chest.  He said it seemed like the batting where people typical sit may need building up."
Positive	We got cupcakes for our party and they made them look awesome.  Not only did they look great but ours tasted fantastic too.  We will make sure to go back for all our pastry needs.  Much better than other cupcake places we've tried.
Positive	#1 BUN BO HUE (HUE SPICY BEEF SOUP NODDLE) in town. Die for that. So delicious! And the very best Combo broken rice plate. Don't miss Pork sausage roll for starter! Yum yum
Positive	"I went to the Mahler event this past Saturday night at the TSO.  It was part of their annual TSO's tsoundcheck program: barbecue, beers - and Mahler.  

I missed the BBQ part, and had wine instead of beer.  I also dressed up, which a lot of other people did as well.  You didn't have to, but why not?

I have gone to the TSO many times but this was the first time I saw so many young people (even teenagers!).  The orchestra was amazing, you could bring alcohol inside and they played 70 minutes straight with out intermission.  

The show was over midnight and ended with a very long, loud, standing ovation for the TSO.  They deserved it.  This was one of the best live performances I have gone to in a long time and I have every intention of making it an annual event."
Positive	One of the best massages I've ever had!!! A friend and I wanted to try hot stone and it was amazing. Heidi was very nice and welcoming. I defiantly will be going back to her soon.
Positive	Absolutely love the experience I had with Andy and Nathan. Their very talkative and funny and better yet they do an extremely great job on your nails. My mom and I can't get enough of the personality that flows around their shop. They even pick your color for you, I promise you'll be happy with their work.
Positive	"If you don't already know how great Jimmy's is, then YOU my friend, are the ONLY person missing out.

Jimmy's makes THE BEST falafel in the city. I'm told their donairs and shawarmas are the best in town as well.

The service is always excellent, the portions are always mind-blowingly massive, the food is always to die for and the prices are always unbelievably cheap.

So what's the long and short of it? It's the same great Jimmy's A & A that we've all come to love, only now it's also available in downtown Calgary! HOLLLLLLLAAAA!"
Positive	"I'm not even joking best fried pickles I've ever had. Also, our waiter Kyle was so helpful and had a great sense of humor. Go for the pickles, but stay for Kyle.

I can't say how good anything else is on the menu, except the sauerkraut and potato pirogies were also good."
Positive	We had the best IHOP experience. I came in very skeptical and upset over the recent name change and the new emphasis on burgers, but our waiter, Gino, made the experience so amazing. Our food was piping hot, and the pancakes were practically sizzling on the plate. BEST IHOP EVER!! 10/10 would recommend to all my friends and family.
Positive	I added a star to my earlier review, as my experience on my latest visit was more in line with my expectations. Barista was pleasant, not overly talkative, but I was greeted and thanked after. Still a pleasant space to spend an hour drinking coffee and reading the paper.
Positive	"I typically like to embellish my reviews, but the day is long and my stomach is empty so I will get right to it. 

By now you know that Seasons 52 changes their menu every season and has a new side menu each week, hence the 52 if that was not obvious enough. There are a hundred other amazing restaurants in this area but Seasons 52 truly stands above the crowd with the total experience factor which includes the great ambiance, service and food that is Vegas worthy.  

If you are looking for an upscale restaurant with moderate prices and food that you can pronounce but tastes like you can't, Seasons 52 is for you."
Positive	This place is just about perfect. The staff is friendly and attentive.  The pizza my wife and I had was thin and crispy. We were kinda hungry so we ordered another and it was the same. The complimentary limoncello and fried dough with powdered sugar was really nice of the owner. We will be eating here again on our next trip to Phoenix.
Positive	Cartel has my favorite coffee in the valley. The coffee is a little on the bitter side but extremely tasty. It's located in the heart of old town Scottsdale. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Really cool vibe.
Positive	Love it !! so much fun to sit around outside and have a few glasses of wine. Very chill atmosphere. Also, I would recommend to put your name in for a table at pizza bianco, then chill at bar bianco..it will be about a good hour before your table will be ready but so worth the wait!
Positive	"With over a dozen types of their own specialty beer, like a raspberry ale with raspberries floating in it,  Brewsters offers a change from the tired old beer and a meal menu. Their small-batch-brewed beers are actually quite good and come with meal suggestions.
I had their brown ale with the meatloaf. That made for an appetizing combination. Nothing was too expensive on the menu and having fresh, clean beer is a nice change from having to suck back skunky Molson draught with a steak sandwich.
I can't wait to get back there and try a few more of their beer and meal combinations."
Positive	"All you can eat? Korean BBQ? I'm sold.

This place is almost too good to be true. The wait staff was amazingly friendly and quick. 
We had several orders of the beef and beef ribs. Both were absolutely delicious...and we loved cooking it ourselves. We prefer the beef ribs slightly charred like my boyfriends mom makes at home. 
We also had the pickled veggies and dumpling. I absolutely loved the pickled daikon, cucumbers and carrots. The dumplings were deep fried, and while they were quite good, I think I prefer pan fried dumplings (potstickers or gyoza). 
Also, the lychee martini was amazing, and if it hadn't been so hot out, I'd probably have had a few more. They were some of the cheapest cocktails around. (I think 5.75 cad or something).
The only hiccup was the internet was down so they couldn't take cards or print a bill, but they did have an ATM so we were able to grab cash out right on the spot.

This place made our trip from BTV to Montreal worth it. I would drive back just to have dinner here."
Positive	The dealership on Sahara left a bad taste in my mouth so I went to this location in hopes to get better service. I ended up purchasing a vehicle for an awesome deal! I also enjoyed the friendly, no-bs service. My dealer Daniel provided awesome customer service as well as the rest of the crew, including the manager. Thanks guys! I love my new car!
Positive	"Today's visit sparked some interesting debate about how to Yelp.

Each consumer ""consumes"" each experience differently - taking with it their own personal knowledge, background and perceptions.  With it, we all write Yelp reviews trying to best help other consumers understand our vantage point so they can pick and choose which information they absorb.

I really like Aunties & Uncles.  I am in the restaurant industry.  I understand it's extremely difficult to run a really small restaurant when it's always really busy.  They have two people in the kitchen, constantly making fresh from scratch food for everyone waiting.  And it's not a small menu - there are lots of options.  There are two wait staff, running around trying to refill waters, coffees, and service other needs.  Despite these set backs, A&U does something great - it serves great food, and good service.  

But because of these set backs, it's a long wait for A&U.  I didn't mind the wait because they have seats outside for the sole purpose of waiting.  I felt like the guy manning the door knew whose turn was next. Then, once inside, you've got a long wait for food.  I didn't mind the wait because I could see the two people in the kitchen working their asses off - and everyone who came before us got served first, and everyone after us got served once we had our food.

The food itself is fresh and delicious, and the coffee is great.  

The bathroom in the basement had a door that didn't close.  At all.  Despite numerous attempts.  This could be seen as a negative.  But when I told the waiter, and asked if there was another washroom, he let me use the upstairs washroom (perhaps a staff washroom?) and I appreciated that.  Again - some people might see having a customer washroom that was ""out of order"" as a negative, but I found a solution that met my needs.

If I'm not crazy hungry - this is where I want to be for brunch."
Positive	"Great dance center! Very affordable and fun adult classes. So far, I've only taken tap - both have been lots of fun and great exercise. Haven't tried the others yet but plan to. The owner is very great and very nice. 

Rare to find an affordable place for drop in classes - so glad this is just down the street from me."
Positive	Stopped in for lunch the other day. I decided to eat a little bit Unhealthy and go with the pastrami sandwich. I'm so glad I did. The pastrami combined with the coleslaw on fresh bread was  fantastic.after I get the gym a few times, I will definitely be back.
Positive	You can't find better bartenders.  Friendly, and know their craft well.  The happy hour is a bargain.  Delicious food items, even if you never reach the steaks. The manager Robert is warm and welcoming.  You will feel right at home.
Positive	"What an incredible meal. 

I live in NY and was in the restaurant industry in AZ for many years. I've known Chris from his days as a Sous Chef at NoCa and was delighted when my friend picked this for my first dinner back. Chris is extremely talented and the food was incredible.

Portions and pricing were excellent. We ordered everything on the menu, including the specials. My favorites were the Pad Thai, Fried Green Tomatoes, Gnocchi and Riblets. 

Service, cocktails and wine were top-notch. I hope they become a pillar for this struggling part of town.

Well done boys!"
Positive	"Have been there a number of times and the food is super. The service and atmosphere are added bonuses. 

The steak and ale pie, sticky toffee pudding, and lobster rolls are and have been totally tasty and delicious. The selection of comfort food is well rounded and slightly different than the average pub/ sports bar."
Positive	"I'm actually a co-op owner, because I strongly believe in what this place is contributing to the community. I buy most of my produce and groceries at Meijer, but we come here quite often for the bulk section and soy products. Prices are very moderate and cheaper than Strawberry Fields.

They also have a salad bar, pizza, and sandwiches. There's a bakery, coffee, and soups. Everything I've tasted has been pretty good!  I recommend bringing your own bags and using cash or a debit card."
Positive	"Everything a you could want from a neighborhood Chinese Food spot! 

The owners are always here and extremely nice. The food is fast, and super tasty. 

Big Bowl reminds me of an East Coast takeout spot. 

Love it."
Positive	I've lived here for three years and the only reason I'm moving is because I bought a home. The apartments are quiet and in a quiet area but close to the city. I'm only one half mile away from work. There are families and pets and rules are followed. When things started to get a little loud and wild, the management had their attorneys notify everyone that they would not tolerate bad behavior. It stopped. The area is kept clean and is refreshed regularly. Jamie and Cecelia are always available and friendly. It's been a very positive experience.
Positive	Great coffee! I dropped in before yoga class, and I had the lavender infused latte and it was so smooth and delicious.  Highly recommend it! Cute spot to just hang out with friends or yourself.
Positive	I love this car wash! The prices are so reasonable and my car always looks spotless when it's done. They really pay attention to detail! I always leave a good tip because I feel like I am not paying enough for the services received. The most expensive package is the VIP and that's only $20 and they clean it perfectly inside and out.
Positive	Amazing! This place has been on our list for awhile and it definitely over delivered. The food was even better than described on the menu. Great food. Great drinks. Fun and casual atmosphere and very nice staff. We'll definitely be back!
Positive	"Lisa the owner is awesome at coloring and cutting. She's talented at creative color, too.  She put violet streaks in my hairs underside that I got constant compliments on. 

Everyone is well trained at this salon, too. When I can't get in with Lisa I book with Julie or Erica knowing that I will be satisfied. 

And they have chocolate in the waiting area! :)

They're in the same plaza as whole foods so you can grab a bite or do your shopping after."
Positive	Such an excellent place to kill time! Such an astounding variety of books, DVDs and CDs (what are those?) If you're looking for a specific title, even newish this is a great place to check for it but this place is even better for those who just want to randomly stumble on something interesting. Best sellers from a few years ago can be found here as they tend to be excess copies that bookstores hold too many of.
Positive	Okay, I have to start by saying I used to be a die hard Pizza Hut girl. However, this particular Dominos really won me over. They're polite, super friendly and FAST. Pretty sure The Flash works there, lol. Seriously though, I've never had a problem ordering (from the app and online) and I LOVE the tracker feature. It lets me know exactly what's going on with my order at all times. I also love the points system to earn free pizza. Today I ordered using the app and forgot to mention I wanted light sauce on my pizza. I called up and they were EXTREMELY nice about it and fixing it wasn't a problem. All the delivery guys (and gals!) are really fast and well put together when they come to the door. All these things converted me into a Dominos fan. My absolute go-to when I want something fast and yummy.  Everyone that works there is a freaking rock star!
Positive	"My girlfriend won the grad trip, probably the cheapest trip to vegas you will ever get. The host Brittany is super dope, good energy, very accommodating and just has a really good personality. Limos and party buses to the clubs. Free alcohol on the rides to the club. Cabanas at the pool party and another ride to the club in the party bus that night. The only thing I would say that could be improved is definitely more alcohol. 50 people need a lot of drinks for it to be ""unlimited.""We brought alcohol to prefade anyways, just wish there was more to drink on the party bus. Costco sells bottles for the low. It's better to have too much and not need anymore than to not have enough.  Overall it is a dope trip though, I would definitely recommend going if you have the opportunity."
Positive	This has to be one of the best steakhouses we've ever been to. From the food to the excellent service. Our recommendation try the crab cakes they are delicious.  Lobster mac and cheese are amazing. Drinks are great also. Our waiter James was very helpful, attentive and overall amazing. We keep coming back not just for the amazing food, but the excellent service.
Positive	Excellent experience here. Friendly staff and nice location.  I love Indian food and I brought my parents here for their first Indian food experience. We got several different things to try a lot of the menu. It was all delicious. We are all happy with the food and experience. The owner/cook even came out to check on what we thought. He was very kind and we appreciated him coming to say hello.  I would come here again soon if I weren't just here on vacation.  I would recommend this place for sure!!
Positive	"I had a great massage this morning with Andrea to address some chronic muscle knots and numbness in my hands when I am sleeping.  

While the massage was very intense, it was exactly what I was looking for. Andrea asked me if the pressure was OK, and I felt comfortable that I could tell her if it was too much or too little. 

I was really, really happy that the massage room is quiet and dark.  No windows! This is very important to me because when I want a relaxing massage, I want it dark.  I was also happy with the fact that I was able to schedule online (major plus in my book) and I was also able to book for the very next day.

My immediate feeling is that I would rebook her again, and probably soon.

This initial review is to capture my immediate impressions and I will update it in a few days when I can better assess the physical effects."
Positive	Phenomenal. Katie and Tim were awesome servers and very attentive - get them if you can! Best cheeseburger ever! The truffle fritters were amazing! The short ribs melt in your mouth. Also, you have to try the Alien Ginger Margarita. Finished up with Salted Caramel Hot Fudge Sundae - unique and delicious! Whoever left this place less than 3 stars must have ordered the wrong thing. Everyhing we ordered was fabulous.
Positive	"Stopped in for a quick lunch and before I hit the front door I knew it was going to be good. The smells drom this place are incredible and the pie is even better.

I had the San Gennero and it was great! The small is enough for two and the flavors were perfect.

The atmosphere is really well done. Great place for a bite at lunch or for dinner before a night on the town.

Five Stars!"
Positive	"AWESOME!!

I came here while visiting CMU, and I was blown away! Service was exemplary, and the food was great! I got the California Club, and it quite good.

A good, casual cafe atmosphere: great for studying!

Would definitely become a regular here if I come to CMU!"
Positive	Went to the movies last night and the theaters have new seats! VERY comfy!!! The people were friendly, as always, and the movie was CRAZY! We saw Split, about multiple personalities, what a mind bender!
Positive	"While I expect things in Vegas to be kinda fake, this place was elegant and and foodie worthy.  We had a few nice appetizers that were presented beautifully and tasted just as good, as well as the stake samplers.  The steaks were great, I have to say the wagu tasted good but not that different, I have always have heard it would be drastically different, but this was not the case, it was not from Japan, so maybe that's the case. We also had a great bottle of wine that the waiter helped us choose.  

The bill for the 4 of us was a whopping $800 but good thing this was a business trip and it was all expensed:)  I'm not sure I would come back on my own dime, it was good but not earth shattering."
Positive	"I see that so many people have posted poor reviews about Vintage Pointe, and that's a shame. I'm on my 4th lease here and it's never been managed better than it is being managed at this time. I'm not saying that it's been perfect, but nowhere is perfect! 

Water and power outages are not under the control of the property management. Broken gates, fences and property burglaries, dog poop, and broken glass in the pool (leading to closures and drainage) are not due to poor management but due to faulty, disrespectful humans. Renter's insurance is in place for a reason, and the additional or fluctuating fee's are all disclosed in the lengthy lease agreement that everyone signs at every move in and renewal. 

The property has been flipped three times, and Camden's office staff was not the best, they were young and disrespectful to people that were not in their 'tribe'. I lived at another Camden property before this one, and shortly after my move to Vintage Pointe, that same staff was moved to Vintage Pointe. The current owners had a different manager at the takeover and she was a pro at yes-yesing me to my face about issues, and then nothing was accomplished. NOW there is Heidi!! 

Heidi has in two months changed the entire energy of the management team for the better! I have noticed that the maintenance and office staff seem to be happier and that makes me, as a resident and their client, happy too! There have been a lot of upgrades to the property and there are many more scheduled to happen. 

I enjoy living here and plan on staying. I know that this property is in improvement mode and it shows. There will always be disrespectful people (other tenants) that don't pick up their dog's waste, litter, and don't make it into the trash can- people are lazy, especially when they think no-one is watching; sending their young children to do these tasks makes it even worse because the kids really don't care at all. 

The property managers are not responsible for disrespectful people's actions, but they spend a lot of time and energy cleaning it up. The quality of humans being allowed to live here has begun to change too, and for this I am happy and thankful. Life here is good, clean, we now have security guards on site, and the property is beautiful. The current office staff and maintenance crew are kind, attentive and respectful. I look forward to the improvements to come!"
Positive	I found this nail shop thats tucked away but definitely a little gem! The customer service is quite friendly, as is the quality of service. The owner Tommy happened to be my nail tech and he was really nice and definitely provide it top-notch service. To top it off, they gave me their punchcard where you get a free pedicure on your 10th visit.
Positive	My first time to Mellow Mushroom and I was very happy with the experience. Great beer selection, the salads were fresh, and the pizza was top notch. I consider myself a fan. I will return.
Positive	Ever since my bad experience with the uncooked rice, this restaurant has been right on the mark with the rice and everything else.  I highly recommend this Filiberto's, the food is good!
Positive	Fish and chips is slamming. Garlic fries are with real garlic..this was awesome!  Kristen is great. Staff is beyond wonderful.  Great atmosphere.  Will be coming back. Wish we had one in Philly
Positive	An awesome tour!!  The cast of Tanked are exactly in person the way they are on the show.....great, down-to-earth people.  We got an insight into how Tanked started, the inner workings of the organization, and got to take pictures with Wade, Heather, the General and Bert.  Trisha was an outstanding tour guide and everyone was very gracious.  These folks are very busy, so you may want to check first to see if who will be in the day you schedule your tour.  Hopefully, you will be as lucky as we were.
Positive	"I discovered this place while searching for somewhere to go wine tasting, thanks to all of you fellow yelpers, this place caught my eye when i read ""FREE wine tasting"" on many reviews. And yes, new yelpers... you read right... FREE! Nothing is better than ""free"" :) The free wine tasting events are friday-sunday... Its 12-6 on Fri/Sat, and 12-4 on Sun.

If i could have one wish right now, it would be to have a Total WIne & More in North Las Vegas! I'm not a fan of driving through Las Vegas, but this place is most definitely worth the drive! They didn't have as many selections during their wine tasting event as they have at the other Total Wine store in Summerlin, but they still had quite a few selections to try and it was well worth it. Who needs to go to a liquor store when there's Total Wine & More? Everything was so organized and the staff were friendly and attentive. I discovered that I liked German wine, and to my luck... they have wines categorized by Country. How awesome is that!? I cant wait to make another trip here! Oh, and even better... they have coupons so you save even more on some products that they sell during the wine taste event. Their prices are pretty good to begin with as well. I noticed some liquors and beer are cheaper here than they are at other places!"
Positive	"We purchased the meal option with the Vegas show. Not a bad deal, but I did pay a $10 up charge for the parade of meat. It was a good choice as the meat literally is paraded to you. No complaints for the meat. Everything I ate was worth eating. My wife stuck with the meal option available with the show pass and it filled her up, but was similar to an outback sirloin special, two sides and a steak. 
This place is definitely not the most amazing Vegas experience, but it was a quality meal for discounted rate. Our experience was not like some of the others with bad service. Yes, the waiter was scarce once he took our order, but there really was nothing for him to do. The other staff roaming around kept our water full, and the guys bringing the meat were very kind and NON-STOP. There literally was meat piling up on my plate. 
In all, I think we saved $30 by using the meal option with the Vegas show."
Positive	On this trip, was determined not to use Showtime, too many bad experiences. Instead, took Airline Shuttle Corp. It was not only better but far exceeded our expectations over Showtime. $13 for a round trip to a strip hotel is certainly very affordable, and pretty much the same price as the others. The big difference, waited less than 5 minutes on our bus, and when it arrived, 6 of us on the shuttle and on our way in about another 5 minutes. They did not make us wait until the bus was full, got us quickly on our way. Hard to say this is the norm, but was a good experience for us.
Positive	I got a cut & color by Domey. She was fantastic! Color is amazing & very pleased with the cut as well. Domey was easy to talk to, understood what I wanted, & did an exceptional job. Salon is darling as well. Will be back & highly recommend!!
Positive	"I had never been to a Ruby Tuesday's outside of Flagstaff Mall and was never impressed with that one.  We ended up here because it appears to be the only actual restaurant inside PV Mall, and it was too hot to walk across the street.

Now, I don't know if the menus vary by restaurants, but this one had a completely different menu than the restaurant in Flag.  Much smaller and much better.  I had an avocado quesadilla.  Now you may think it would be hard to screw that up, but I was prepared for some green crap mildly resembling avocado, but it was actually the real thing.  My husband had the chicken pot pie.  That looked yummy-it was in a bowl of puffed pastry.  He was pleased.  Great salad bar, too.

What stood out was the service.  Excellent.  Would definitely come here again, but probably would still shy away from the chain otherwise."
Positive	I prefer this over Roberto's. Great sauces and excellent food. Plus I always love when a fast food joint is setup so you can easily see all of your food being made.
Positive	Vivace was excellent. I started with a side mixed green salad which was very tasty, not too large, not too small. Then, I had the sea scallop risotto for my entree and the swallows were cooked just right; the risotto was just the right consistency. The flavor was great as it needed no salt or pepper. I liked that the restaurant offered small portions as it allowed me room for dessert. Of course I had to try the tiramisu which was delicious. In addition to the food, the atmosphere and service was awesome. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Charlotte area.
Positive	"Second time we've needed a tv repair here in Vegas.  
Three years ago we found Bens TV repair.  What an awesome person Ben is.  The tv started acting up and we weren't sure to buy a new one or get it repaired   We called Ben and he came to our house.   He Had our tv repaired in hours  that tv is used in a different room and our new 2yr old Vizio went on the fritz.   
Ben to the rescue again.   Fixed in a day.   The cost is very economical not to mention he gives you cost upfront.  If there is more to be done he calls to see what YOU want done.  
We highly recommend Bens tv repair. He is honest and very friendly.   He always asks the right questions before he comes so he is prepared right  from the start.   If in need for tv repair call Bens tv repair. 702-280-9532."
Positive	"This place is basically 18-20 year old me's most romantic date spot/dream come true. The soundtrack was straight off my iTunes playlist when I brought along my love of Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, and musicals to college and learned about a whole bunch of awesome international music. It's a converted home with gorgeous ""bohemian"" (i.e. Turkish because this is actually a Turkish place) lighting, picturesque paintings and colored walls. Eating here is like living in a quirky, ""ethnic"" restaurant from a British RomCom :)

Okay, so now that you want to go there to experience this basic b!tch's college dream life, it's time to talk about the food! I took one bite of the Izgara Kofte and practically did a physical double take. HOW THE HELL WAS THIS SO GOOD??? Seriously, I enacted the wide eyed emoji and looked over to my husband like... you HAVE to try this! He was already basically mirroring me with his Chicken Kofte. The Turkish Tea was such a delightful addition to the meal and the only complaint was from my husband that the baklava was TOO fresh because he likes his when it gets a little more stale/hard. So basically, if you were already going here from my fantabulous intro paragraph, I KNOW you want to go here now :)

I don't like giving out five stars, but heck, I'm not a Michelin critic - I can freaking love a place for is adorableness as WELL as its food :)))"
Positive	I phone ordered soft shelled tacos and picked up in the drive thru and when I got home all the tacos were hard shells . I called and spoke with the manager and they put me on a list for my next  visit to receive more tacos . When I returned the manager on duty was Alex and I had absolutely no problems . She apologized or the inconvenience and made things right . I have never received such good customer service! Thank you Alex for caring !!!
Positive	"Stayed in the basic luxury king room and I have to say I was more than content.

When we arrived they only had a 2 queen room available but told us to call first thing to change rooms. It was quick and easy and they kept us on the same floor as our party. 

Our mini fridge wasn't getting cold when we called they came to check within the hour but said it was fine. But they sent us a larger fridge right away. We also had our privacy plaque up the entire time but housekeeping called everyday to make sure we didn't need towels or anything.

All the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful. The pool was nice, the room was more than sufficient and had a great time. The rooms are a little outdated but by no means not adequate. Would definitely stay again or recommend to a friend.

Only bad thing, the water pressure in the shower sucks."
Positive	"9/7/2013

A 3-hour tour is what we got.  The tour guide was thorough and gladly answered questions.  He was knowledgeable in bot technical aspects, business aspect and social aspects of the furnaces and history.  However, this is risky place to walk in and you need to watch where you walk. At the beginning of the tour the pace is a bit quick for someone out of shape or with bad knees.   After that it settled down.  A couple of sets of stairs of about 40-50 steps each can be rough and visitors should be made aware of this before showing up.  There is no place to sit and relax and yes, it is dirty,    Part of the challenge is finding this place.  Follow the instructions on  the web site.  

This is a national historic site that might eventually become a national park.  This could ruin the tours since national park rules would probably keep you from entering certain areas because this place can be dangerous.  Part of the excitement is touring all parts, even those rusting away."
Positive	I saw Dr. Walia Who performed a deep cleaning, wisdom teeth extraction, scaling and I have to say I am extremely happy with my results! Dr. Walia was very attentive to any needs I had throughout my procedures even checking up on me at home following those procedures. He and his staff are incredibly kind, caring and professional. I would recommend Dr. Walia for any procedures you might need.
Positive	"The resort is part of our Shell Vacations Club ownership and when we visited for just a night in April, we added it to our list of places to come back to for a weekend getaway. We were fortunate to take this getaway August 14th - 16th.  

This was a perfect spot for a weekend getaway.  We only left the resort once, and that was to go sample some bbq at Little Miss BBQ just down the road.

We took our 18 month old and she couldn't have been happier enjoying the wade pool and the main pool (when daddy gained enough ambition to get off his lazy rear to go for a relaxing swim).  

This is a beautiful spot.  We stayed in a 1 bedroom which came complete with jacuzzi in the bedroom, full kitchen, living room, dining room, full size balcony (we prefer 2nd floor), and bathroom with stand up shower.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Both the living room tv and master room tv come complete with dvd player, and as we knew it was going to be a hot weekend (114 degrees) we brought movies to watch during the afternoons.

The pool, while one large pool, is broken down with two parts, 1 side straight for the lap swimmers, and the other curved for the kids to play around and do their thing.  The depth goes to 5ft and diving isn't allowed. There's a seperate wading pool and 2 hot tubs, one in the main pool area and a 2nd around the gate for adults only.

There are tennis courts, volleyball area, and playground for the kids.  The kids playground was covered so there was no direct sunlight beating down on us.

There's a Walmart Essentials close by and we stocked up on food there to supply us through the weekend.

This is a timeshare so when you check in, there is some pressure to take a meeting during your stay, but after saying no a few times, we went on with a relaxing weekend.  

We look forward to another stay in April, during the kids spring break when we can arrange time with the grandparents to fly from Chicago and stay with us."
Positive	"We've been here many times before on the weekends so we tried it out on a Wednesday evening. What a treat... cool vibe, great service (Andrea) and Duane Moore was fantastic on the guitar.

Ordered The Sonoma, Artisan Board and Shrimp Skewers with a couple of glasses of Malbec.

Perfect evening, highly recommend."
Positive	I like it.  It reminds me of another place called Gusti Italian Grill that was sadly only open for 4 months before it closed down due to poor management.  The food at Piada is great, quick and they have healthy options, just don't eat the actual piada.  The piada cheese stick has like 790 calories!!!  But the pasta and salad bowls are reasonable and tasty.  Kudos to this place.
Positive	Midnight specials(midnight to 6 a.m/) honored with your boarding pass. Super cheap and large, awesome portions.  No complaints here. Had the 8 oz steak, hash browns, eggs and toast for $5.99!! Their country fried steak with sides is ONLY $4.99 and is enormous!  The decor in this place is nice, but the service could improve greatly. They were very SLOW and it wasn't busy.  A special thank you to Cashmere who works at the pastry/desert counter. She is a pleasure and excellent with customer service. :)
Positive	I was in Willoughby Hills for a couple weeks and visited this cool place! I went with a friend that's from the area and told me I had to try their BLT. So I did and it was the most extraordinary BLT I have ever had. Went back again to get one more before I left town. Also had very friendly service and a good selection of beer on tap! Highly recommended
Positive	"I go to bubble Mixology almost everyday now!
Its the only icecream i want in town!
Their nitrogen infused coffee affogato with their coffee icecream is a must try!
I love the new ""build your own Bubble Waffle"" menu
I got the ""thai breeze"" chocolate-coconut bubble waffle with thai tea icecream banana whipped cream and chocolate-coconut pocky sticks 
Prices have gone down since their soft opening
and they have a new drink menu! Nitrogen coffee milk was of course my first pick 
guys their icecream and waffle batters are all hand crafted and authentic 
so for those of you who appreciate real tea, ingredients with natural flavors this is the spot to go!  Their staff members are great! pleased with their progress on the menu and i am definitely their return customer for as long as they are here"
Positive	"Mai Japanese Express is my go-to place for sushi in the neighborhood.  I can't speak to the non-sushi items, but the sushi and rolls are fresh and well-prepared.  They may not have the variety that some other sushi places have, but the rolls they go make are solid.  Their sushi rice is flavorful every time as well, so it really complements their nigiri and rolls.  I've occasionally had issues with the tuna being less fresh than the other fish, but that seems to be a problem at several other sushi places here in Charlotte.  I also really like their ginger dressing that comes on the salad - I think it's tastier than a lot of other restaurant's dressing.

I always get carry-out here, so I can't speak to the service.  However, each time I've been in the restaurant was clean and the employees were nice. The prices are a little higher than some other restaurants in the area, but I think the quality of food is much higher and is worth the price.  Once of these days I will definitely have to dine in instead of getting carry-out."
Positive	"We visited Muddy River Distillery with a Groupon last weekend -- it included a tour, a tasting & a shot glass. Hold on to your shot glass - it gives you free tours for life! I so wish I lived closer!

The owners were super friendly and you could tell they love what they do. We went to the 4:00 tour, but if you're a better planner I heard the 5:00 is the longer, more informative tour. We didn't have reservations but they seemed flexible with walk-ins. 

The owner talks to you a bit about Muddy River, what they are working on, where you can find them - but let's be real, we're all waiting for the tasting. You get to taste 6 of their spirits - including a couple of moonshines. My faves were the coconut rum and the amaretto moonshine, yum!

They have a shop in the front where you can buy direct from them (1 bottle/per person/per year, thanks NC laws). I would definitely visit again, hopefully for the 5:00 tour next time!

Tip: Bring a bottle of water to cleanse your palate between tastes!"
Positive	Its a surprise to me as a local that this place is busy and people from all over come here. The food is great. I had the chicken fried steak..the gravy was delicious. The owner is the host and he really makes you feel welcome. We waited for a 20 mins to be seated and it was 11am.  This place is really close to where I live and Im glad i found another breakfast place because I love a good breakfast. We will come back to try their pancake and french toast which looks good.
Positive	OH SO DEELISH! The chicken ramen is sooooooo good, I couldn't stop eating it to take a pic! The broth makes your soul feel its best. Make sure to try it with the garlic butter if you want to fully experience greatness.
Positive	First visit and on New Year's Eve! Wasn't sure what to expect, but was very satisfied with the food and service. My only recommendations would be to remove the nutmeg from the butter that goes on the complementary bread, and have the filet and the shrimp and grits meals available without pork touching them. Otherwise, the ribeye and kabobs were cooked just right.
Positive	I just want to echo all the 5 stars everyone else has given to this specialist office and the wonderful staff. I saw Dr. Toniolli for a THIRD root canal on the same tooth, and with his up to date microscope technology, calm attitude and precision skills, he not only did excellent work, he found a past unresolved issue: he found a FOURTH canal that no other dentist had. I believe the tooth should be fine now, and I trust this office that makes you feel very comfortable and welcomed. They open at 7am too, which is earlier than many, and when I arrived at that time, they were already awake and cheery, so that alone said a lot-lol. GREAT WORK Valley Endodontic Group, thank you!
Positive	"Had an amazing dinner at Toqué during my trip to Montréal last weekend. I had very high expectations and the service and food both exceeded them! Very glad I decided to celebrate my birthday here.

My boyfriend and I did the tasting menu (him with Foie Gras and me with Fish) and the five wine pairing. While everything was really good, the seared Tuna was the standout of the meal, and top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. I'm so happy that we were here this specific night, the week they got this tuna in, though I'm sure whatever else they have instead when they don't have the fresh tuna is great too. 

My boyfriend and I both live in Manhattan, so we are rarely wow-ed by food, so when I say that we both were in disbelief when we took the first bites of the tuna I'm not saying it lightly. He's lived there forever and is a frequent traveler, and it was worth it coming here just for me to have the satisfaction of picking a restaurant that produced a meal capable of impressing him! 

The wine was also great, as was the service. Not a cheap meal but definitely a must if you're looking to eat some truly phenomenal food while in Montréal."
Positive	A fun and SAFE environment.  We haven't had interactions with every coach but Kevin and Erin are amazing! We are so impressed with their ability to be strict and fun when appropriate.  The coaches think about the gymnast first and what's best for them.  I am very pleased with our experience here so far!
Positive	"I hadn't eaten at ES before but saw the great reviews and thought I'd try their breakfast burrito since they had tots in them. Tots rock BTW. I had the Undergrad with the sausage and pork belly. YUM! Great flavor, slightly toasted and crispy tortilla, meat was warm and flavorful, cheese all melty, egg scrambled and hot, and house sauce was complementary/flavorful without being overwhelming. I was really looking forward to that first hot, crispy-crunchy tot bite

I got to the tot. Cold, chewy, disappointing. Maybe it was a one off fluke. I mean, they have tots all over their menu. They seem to stake their reputation, at least partly, on their tot offering. They must know how to tot right. 

Nope. I pulled a tot out to eat it alone and same disappointment. Tots ruined what started out as a great breakfast. I told the staff and they quickly replaced the burrito. The second burrito was much better. Tots were warm, and not chewy, but still not crispy-crunchy. So ES only gets 4 stars because they don't do their tots crispy-crunchy. 

I learned they bake their tots. I think you can still get a crispy-crunchy tot with baking. Maybe it was an off day or new kitchen staff. I'll try them again or try another location at some point."
Positive	"We went to see Glendale Glitters on a recent Tuesday evening. Parked near the park around 8:15. My wife and had heard but never experienced this place before, but knowing they closed at 8:30, decided that at best we would maybe be able to order a to go pizza. We never want to be those people that try and sit right near closing!! Walked up to the restaurant and was warmly greeted at the door, told them we would order and go with it but she asked us to sit, relax and enjoy ourselves! We were very impressed!
Shawn our waiter never made us feel like they were about to close, told us to take our time and let him know when we were ready to order. We ordered the calamari appetizer, some wine and a beer. The calamari was awesome, tender and very flavorful. We ordered the Salvatore pizza for the both of us, and it came very quickly! Excellent high quality ingredients, perfect crust! We ate everything, were even offered desert even though they were now closed. Will definitely be back, excellent food and service!! Thanks Shawn"
Positive	Not many Hungarian restaurants in Toronto, this happens to be a great one! Smaller place, and surprisingly very very busy! It has a cozy feel, and a European style decor...kind of like your in Grandmas kitchen! Note: CASH ONLY. This atmosphere is definiteley a nice change from your typical Toronto restaurant. There is a bit of a wait (30minute), so be sure to make a reservation well ahead of time. The best part about this restaurant is the portions and pricing. All prices are with tax included, so what you see is what you pay for! The portions are extremely generous compared to what you usually get in Toronto. My group of friends and I got the platter for 4 that included 3 schnitzels (veal, chicken and beef), 2 grilled sausages, beet salad, a breaded/cheese curd appetizer and potatoes, oh and not to forget the cabbage rolls and sauerkraut all for $70! Very delicious, my favourite was the cabbage rolls...they are very filling and full of flavour. Be sure to ask for some sauces for the schnitzels...your options are a bit limited with regular over the counter mayo and yellow mustard...it would be great if there was some organic or home made styled sauces. Very home styled feel, puts your right in Hungary. 4/5 would come again!
Positive	I messed up attempting to try this place on a Friday night. Please note: if u want to be seated quickly then make a reservation!!! Other then the extensive wait time to be steated and the wait for your food in whole quality was amazing and fresh. The drinks were made perfectly by a bright and bubbly bartender and the food was outstanding. Its always refreshing when you try a place that claims to have fresh pasta and they really do. My favorite part of the food besides the fresh pasta was the fresh peas!!! I despise peas and think them to be little balls of baby food so i was sketchy on trying theirs but i was pleasantly surprised at how good they were!!! Huge recommendation on eateries for the foodies of Las vegas!!!
Positive	love this place. they are polite to me and always helpful. I've been getting gels for over two years now with James and I've gone to a few other places in between while out of town  etc and no one compares to James! I always make regular appointments and have never had to wait. I cannot speak for walk ins as I've never been a walk in client but I've never walked away dissatisfied from James and will not ever go anywhere else.
Positive	Had a lovely dinner while in pittsburgh house hunting. Brussels sprouts app was delish with ample Parmesan cheese to add even more flavor. Smoked beets were good.. truffle fries were outstanding.. chicken sandwich was ok a little on the spicy side and fried. People next to us had what looked to be amazing pot roast!!! Plan to come again.
Positive	Finally found delicious, healthy meals that are delivered to my fridge. Keeta is an amazing cook w a creative mind, the menu is unique each week. I've enjoyed all of the fresh meals and especially like the clean start energy balls for breakfast! Chia pudding is also A+ and keeps for days!
Positive	"Went here during restaurant week - 3 courses for $36. For that price, I would give this place 5 stars. As their usual price is significantly higher, I give this place 4 stars.

Lets start with the food - delicious, creative, unique. The big theme I noted is that cooking is done via sous vide, enabling them to achieve unique textures you may not have tried before. One of the courses that night involved a sous vide egg yolk, which had a texture much like butter. The salmon was very moist and flaky - a beautiful medium rare. While I appreciate a restaurant which goes through the time and effort to do this, it's really not that hard to do on your own either. Also, it's delicious.

They also like to bring sauces and pour them on your dish tableside. These sauces show the restaurants originality - my favorite being the shellfish sauce, which was paired with a pork loin. It was creamy and very fishy - and that worked fantastically well with my sous vide pork.

Oh, and before I forget, the beef tartar was probably the best I've ever had. If it's on the menu, don't miss it!

Service was decent - they only had 2 servers for the restaurant that night, and given the intensive level of service required for this restaurant (changing silverware between courses, explaining each dish as it is served, etc.) it was sometimes slow. But the servers were very nice, well informed about the food, and helpful when I managed to get their attention.

Overall, this place is a tad too pricey for what it offers. I likely won't go back until the next restaurant week because of this. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my meal here very much."
Positive	"I love Chipotle in general. I hate their anti-GMO stance and their inability to prevent horrible outbreaks of terrible diseases, but that risk is MINIMAL. Go ahead and take that as a given in all of my Chipotle reviews. I'm reviewing each of these Chipotles independently.
Since the Old Town location screwed up our faxed lunch orders so much, I was very happy when this location opened up. I RARELY had them screw up a fax order (although maybe 20% of the time, it would happen, which was not nearly as significant as the other location). They are a very friendly staff over here. They don't have as many fax issues as the Old Town location, but there were a few times when I didn't confirm my fax order immediately, and this ran into me sitting around while they finished the order. Decent portions, though I wouldn't say generous as PV mall or some in Seattle. Parking lot is a bit of a deathtrap, but hey, it's Scottsdale. Overall though, good experience."
Positive	"I am currently a senior at west coast ultrasound institute, getting ready to go off to externship with an awesome site placement at a hospital. I would personally say that if you put in the work, then what you get out of this school is worth it. We get ample scanning time in the lab which I personally believe is the most important part of this entire program. You can be extremely book smart, and not be good at scanning. It takes practice, practice, practice. I work in a hospital setting as a CNA and most of our Sonographers went to west coast ultrasound institute, and they are amazing sonographers with registries. 

Our school has changed quite a bit since some of these reviews. It is actually frustrating to me reading some of these. Our program now offers and AAS degree, with 6 months of extern instead of 3 which is a huge change for the better. We are now able to sit for the ARRT sonography exam right when we graduate, which allows us to then sit for ARDMS or for CCI. There is no more working full time for a year before sitting for the registries.That was the main issue with this school just a year ago. We offer great extern sites, but our extern coordinator is picky about site placement. If you are lazy, get bad grades, are absent or tardy often, you probably will not get placed in a site that is expecting a good student that is ready and willing to learn. You are still going to get a site, but it may not be the site you want. 

Unfortunately this is a for profit school, not run by the government and with that there will be hiccups and things are not perfect. Which is why I did not give a full 5 stars. However overall, if you are a good student, study the material, read the books, and scan as much as possible this program is worth not waiting 10 years to get a spot in gateway. 

Bottom line I would absolutely recommend this school, if you are willing to work hard, study harder, and put in your absolute best. If you are looking for an easy ride to make good money then I wouldn't recommend a career in sonography. This is a tough career path not for the lazy or weak minded."
Positive	Ample parking.  Brightly lit.  Friendly staff.  Love the cheese and salad selection.  If you ever see the Chile Rellenos in the frozen section,  grab a few.  We usually buy all that they have they are so delicious.
Positive	The fiance and I came here for a very early dinner. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by very friendly staff and seated right away. There were only two other parties in the restaurant, but no surprise since it was so early. We both had pad thai with beef instead of shrimp and shared the golden bananas. I'm new to thai cuisine, but really enjoyed my noodles. The meat was cooked and seasoned very well, the veggies were delicious, the noodles were not too soggy and a great thickness, and the sauce was delightfully spicy with just a tiny bit of sweetness to it. All of the staff was super friendly, and the manager made sure to stop by and speak to us about our meal as well as their promotions and lunch buffet.  My fiance said his pad thai was not the best he has had, but that he did enjoy it very much.  And my left over noodles made for a great lunch the next day.
Positive	"Oh Mary Lou how I love you!

I still don't know how this dish came to be called the Mary Lou, but I don't care what it is called...it is sooo good!  A cheese quesadilla covered in a delicious green beef chile sauce....it is so indulgent, but it is worth it!  They sure don't skimp on the cheese here and the beef in the chile is so tender it just melts in your mouth.  Add on a side of their delicious beans and you have yourself a tasty meal.  Be prepared to share (or just have lots of leftovers) cause this thing is huge!  The best part is during happy hour you can get it for half price!

The tacos, enchiladas and beans are also top notch here.  I would also have to say the plain old cheese crisp is one of the best ones out there, always crispy and not skimpy on the cheese!

I just wish they had a parking space for take-out orders!"
Positive	I got a really good deal on snow tires here a few years ago. They throw in a free alignment.  Their prices are generally competitive. If you don't know much about tires and you want decent advice and a piece of mind, then this is a great place for you. You can get better deals elsewhere if you do a lot of tire research, but as the average driver probably doesn't even know how to read a car tire size, they should find Bruce Brothers to be perfect for them. For someone who knows the tires they want, this place might be limited and unless they changed their policy, they don't price match.
Positive	I've had Danny Boys once before and liked it. It wasn't extraordinary but it was definitely good and worth the money as the ingredients were fresh.  The staff is very nice and the place seems to be very popular. I'd recommend the pizzas that are more unique with other sauces than just the standard tomato sauce.
Positive	First time to the XD section of this Cinemark.  Popular place.  Great seats.  Beer and wine but pricey.  Tuesday's is half off.  Fast processing for tickets.  Good service.  Appears only a few years old.  Audio and video digital systems.  LOUD at times.  Hint.  Sit in the middle rows all the way in back-- the screen is large and sitting closer makes your head spin after awhile in action movies.  Food area clean; restrooms maintained well.
Positive	"PWR

I first found this place via craigslist...they post a lot and basically own the space for power window repair. They said they had great yelp reviews and they were not lying....really not a bad review. I called to a few other places and almost took on the job myself after getting some very high quotes from some reputable places. PWR gave me what I thought was a very fair quote to replace the window regulator on my wife's and I 99 Jetta. She decided to drive to their ""office"" location which is actually a converted home. It's very nice, not ghetto, its fine. We did this because it's hot and having people fix things in a parking lot is never cool...pun intended. Paul was a great tech, he had the job done in about 45 min, it also included fixing some things that the previous repair ""attempted"" to fix with tape and glue at no extra charge. Thank you! Berkley handed all the money aspects and was very kind and answered all our questions. I will be having them look at another car of ours in the very near future.

Thank you PWR"
Positive	I've moved in not too long ago from out-of-state & the staff have been incredibly helpful since. The apartments are clean, residents are quiet but friendly, and my agent, Jesse, that helped with the setup was incredible during the whole process. Definitely recommended if you're looking to be a new resident in the Henderson area.
Positive	We moved to Vegas about 3years ago and always craved food like this! First time we went we didn't know it could be X rated but laughed our asses off! Now we are regulars we love tiger! If you can get him to cook for you please do!!! Every time family comes into town we take them here and they LOVE IT! Oh and make sure you try the yum yum!!! I take tons home every time!
Positive	Loco is one of the best places for a good time. Food was amazing and the service could not have been better. I recommend this bar to anyone who wants Mexican food and good margaritas at a cheap price! A+
Positive	"The Beatles? Count me in. 
Cirque du Soleil? Yea, why not. 
Combine the two? OHH YEAA.

I've seen enough Cirque shows to know that the is no such thing as bad seats (unless it just happens to be obstructed) and I actually prefer the seats in the back since you don't have to crane your neck. We had the perfect view of everything from the back (all performers, corners, screens).

The show starts out slow but things really kick into gears half way through. By the end, I'm crying from the performance and nostalgia, and then when it ends, I'm just sad there isn't more. Beautifully choreographed to the songs and just flows so perfectly."
Positive	"My friend recommended this threading salon and I decided to check it out since my eyebrows needed major help! I've been to other salons in the valley for threading services, but none of them compare to the awesome service I received from Sristi! 

Sristi was super sweet and really paid attention to the detail in my eyebrows and made sure that I loved them before I left. She also took the time to explain what she was going to do to them and made sure that it was okay with me first. Other salons don't even bother to consult with you first, so this factor really stood out to me! I'll definitely be back in a few weeks to get threaded by Sristi!"
Positive	"I've had Pad Thai with Chicken and Tofu here at lunch and dinner. The lunch portion is smaller but it comes with a fried egg roll. I only get mild but I hear that medium spiciness is pretty spicy.

The dinner portion to go is amazing. I tend to eat a lot, and my friend and I were able to share a dinner portion and were completely full afterward.

I love Tum Nak Thai because they don't charge extra for splitting up the meat. I love fried tofu, but sometimes I just want a little meat, so I always ask for a mix here. 

The flavor is good, but the dish is pretty oily."
Positive	Went last night for dinner, sushi was great!  We kept it simple with spicy tuna, white crab, Philadelphia rolls, etc.  They were all fresh and delicious.  We ordered five rolls and then took the server's suggestion for a sixth, the Love roll, which was also very tasty.  I'm a big fan of casual little places like this, and the closed circuit tv showing your sushi being made was a nice touch.  I'll definitely be going back!
Positive	In a city full of great coffee places and pastries, Café St. Henri is quite deserving of another rave review.  Despite our group overwhelming the small staff, everything was A-okay.  All our coffee drinks came with a palate cleansing shot of sparkling water (nifty idea). My very pretty latte was one of the best tasting I've ever had....and I've had many.  And the berry muffins were amazing, fluffy and chock full of actual fruit.  Can you ship some to me please?!
Positive	Another great experience! The service was much quicker this time and all of our sushi rolls came out together much sooner than last time. :-) My new favorite is the yum yum scallop crunch roll and my husband's is the lobster roll. The Cajun albacore was much more balanced than the garlic albacore. The eel and spicy tuna and spicy tuna crunch rolls were also delicious! Yea, we didn't realize we ordered two similar rolls until we got our food :3 but it was still tasty. It seemed pretty busy tonight too so I'm glad that they seem to be doing well. Love this place!
Positive	Joe and Ty have been doing my nails for about 8 years (since they were in Reno) and their professionalism and personalized attention to their customers is something I haven't found anywhere else in NV. Yes, they are inside Walmart but that only makes them even more convenient. Joe's pedi's are unmatchable, sometimes he has ladies waiting for hours but worth it! Tom is amazing as well for mani's!
Positive	"literally the most amazing food ever! everything i got was delicious! very experimental in the food combinations but every single one they've come up with is awesome!

try the mac and cheese! i know that the dates sound weird but it's amazing!"
Positive	For Las Vegas buffets it's hard to beat Red Rock Casino. The servers are nice and attentive considering how many people they are serving is impressive. Cecelia was our server today and I don't think anyone could have performed their job any better.  The food at the buffet is extensive serving food from Asian, BBQ, Italian and Mexican. The desserts are decent with a wise cracking guy serving gelato and the gelato isn't bad but the salad bar is very good. The prime rib I had I didn't care for but everything else was quite good. Prime rib can be tricky and today it was a bit tough. Unfortunately my wife was here the other night and said it was tough then too. We like coming here. Good atmosphere and service.
Positive	"Made to order, so give yourself 30 minutes for a hot and freshly prepared meal.
Various heat scale flexibility, and a very extensive menu variety.
Dress is casual, and during the warm weather, there is a private courtyard for outside dining.
Great vegetarian selections, and equally ample meat offers, including wonderfully prepared Goat Curry.
Finish with a cup of Masala Chai Tea and choices from ice-cream; Mango Lassi; 
Ras Malai (sweet cottage cheese with pistachio and rose water); and much more.
-Friendly Staff
-Order at counter and choose a seat
-Reasonably priced
-Authentic Indian Cuisine
-Casual ambience
** Will Return Often**!"
Positive	"Definitely recommend!! 

My friend had Stevee do hair and make up for her wedding in October 2015 and did such a fabulous job.  Stevee was outgoing, fun, professional and did exactly what we had asked for so I decided to book her company for my 10 year vow renewal July 2016.

My event couldn't have turned out better.  Besides myself there were 5 ladies getting make up.  The 2 gals that came to our hotel were on point.  My hair was amazing and the extensions were placed perfectly even after having them cut into a different shape back in WA state.  Our make up was so pretty and ALL of us were extremely happy with the results.  Stevee's staff was friendly, efficient and listened to what we wanted but also gave feedback which we really appreciated. They were also very sweet with my 5 year old daughter. They styled her hair and put a little make up on to make sure she felt special, too.

I can't wait to go to Vegas again and just have my hair and make up done for a fun night out!"
Positive	"Love square one my favourite mall so far. 
Great food court great food. Variety of stores with a lot of discount ( check well though for greater deal)

Only inconvenience toooooooooo crowded 
A lot of human bumping if you don't pay attention lol."
Positive	"After seeing them listed on the open table top 100 restaurants in Canada I couldnt help myself by to make a reservation (note that you can't actually reserve for 2 people, the minimum number of people for online reservation is 3). They actually have happy hour from 11-5 where there are deals on a lot of their dishes - it's not a huge discount, but it's like 1-2 dollars off each dish. 
I've been twice so far, and I'm definitely going back. The menu is extensive enough that after two visits there are still things that we want to go back and try. It's mostly meat that you grill yourself, but there are other menu options, some veggie sides (like butter corn... Mmmmm yummmm, broccoli (which I think also has butter) and there are some rice and noodle bowls and appetizers as well. 
We tried the bibimbap and the garlic noodles. Personally I like the garlic noodles better, good taste, and I love the texture. There are other small appetizers, such as deep fried bacon and fried calamari etc. The deep fried bacon - as much as it sounds super unhealthy - was amazing, so amazing that the calamari fell short, and I usually love calamari. 
They also have a phone app where you can collect points and get free stuff for your next visit! 
Great food, good prices, excellent service... Can't ask for more!"
Positive	"Everything I imagined a Korean taco could be! I have dreamt of Korean tacos, and 9091 is kinda like a dream come true. From the cute Dr. Seuss-esque building to the complex flavors delivered in corn tortillas, the details add up to a winner winner kimchi dinner.

The menu is simple and reasonably priced with tacos, burritos, tortas, and salads. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos. They came heavily dressed in cabbage! Bravo! I love greenery. The flavors were definitely Korean, enhanced by two sauces on the side. One sauce reminded me of bibimbap dressing; the other a galbi marinade. Yum and yum. Plus, I am a huge fan of corn tortillas, and they double 'em up here Mexican street style. Last, but not least, the tacos are served with sweet potato straws. The needle-like nature of this side might not be the best, but even in slivers, the flavor is banging in a big way. I found myself greedily stuffing as many into my mouth as possible to capitalize on the flavor punch. Perhaps shoveling them onto the taco would be smart call, kind of like the old chips on a sandwich trick. 

They crank the music for atmosphere. The day we visited it was country! Talk about a culture collision: Korean tacos while listening to Tim McGraw. Hey, as long as they keep the tasty kibbles coming, I'll listen to whatever they like! Hopefully, they'll get more seating in the near future. I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of country-humming taco eaters real soon."
Positive	The best Thai food around! It's one of my favorite restaurants. The waitresses are always very pleasant and happy. The food is always served quickly and is very delicious. In the 4+ years I've been going there I've never had a bad meal. Their Thai iced tea is soooooo good too!
Positive	"I hadn't been here since they closed for remodeling. I stopped here for lunch with a coworker and it appears that they have changed up the menu as well as the process for ordering lunch. It is now waiter service: no more order and then fight for an available table type deal. The menu seems a bit smaller but with more Asian-inspired dishes, particularly with their addition of the ""Oceanic Banh Mi."" 

I had to get something off the new menu so I ordered the Oceanic Banh Mi with Swordfish. My coworker ordered the Tacos Del Dia (tacos of the day) with Blackened Chilean Sea Bass. To my surprise, Penn Ave Fish Company got all the components of the banh mi right: sweet and sour pickled vegetables, fresh cilantro and cucumber, spicy fresh jalapeño and the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside French baguette. They even wrapped it in paper the same way Vietnamese delis do it. The swordfish had a type of Asian barbecue sauce that added a wonderfully savory yet sweet aspect to the sandwich. Having tried their old swordfish sandwich, I have to say I like this version a lot better. I didn't get to taste my coworker's tacos but they had a lot of colorful ingredients that looked to be incredibly fresh. My only gripe about Penn Ave Fish Company is that they haven't changed their flavorless sides. Our meals came with Asian Slaw and it was mainly shredded cabbage and vinegar.  Perhaps by doing this, they are putting more emphasis on the flavors of the main entrees, but I feel it should be about the meal as a whole. But I can't be too upset because my banh mi was pretty delicious. 

Overall, great lunch spot and probably the best place for sushi in downtown Pittsburgh. Also a great place for intimate, romantic dinners."
Positive	Absolutely love the food here!!! The short ribs are to die for, which I ordered again today. Also, tried out their tropical lemonade which is made fresh daily and continues guava (my favorite juice) and passion fruit. So yummy. Highly recommend this place.
Positive	"The aroma from the outside was amazing! I could already sense the positive vibes of the business with how packed the parking was, and with the line almost beginning to form from the inside. It seemed really exciting and alluring. 

The decor of this place is reminiscent of an LA Korean bbq establishment I frequent before. The place looked very trendy and the lighting was good. 

We were actually seated rather quickly and was placed in a nice part of the restaurant. The service was ok but I was quite disappointed they did not have dishes I thought traditional places would carry. They had No Chicken or Seafood... Ouch! 

The prices seemed on the higher side but the flavors were really good. The side dishes were not what I was hoping for while the soups did taste amazing. 

Overall, I think this place is ok. Not sure if I would frequent it again as many of my friend do eat chicken and seafood. Foodies, please try it out and see for yourself."
Positive	You have to love the tiny restaurants that have a giant impact on the taste buds.  The food was cooked perfect.  The chicken was fresh and juicy and the vegetables were cooked to an al dente texture.  I ordered the Asian Q and added a perfectly cooked over medium egg which was spot on.  My wife order the Coconut Curry Chicken which was really good.  It was a little on the sweet side for me, but very good with the brown rice.  DO NOT forget to try the Lychee lemonade, Mmm.  The staff was so happy and their knowledge of the menu was impressive.  Great job to all the staff at Mochiko...we will return!
Positive	"So! I have been frequenting Earth Fare consistenty for about 6 weeks now (even though I am a Heniens lifer) - and today was a pretty cool experience.  I stopped in to get a cake for a family birthday dinner and got a pleasant surprise!!! 

As I said- at the the bakery to get a cake and of course they had sold out of the red velvet.  So in my mind, I am thinking...""great cake w/o a lot of preservatives""... I guess I'm headed to Westgate's Earth Fare, which is like 30 minutes away!  

So any who.... I decided to grab a litte brown rice suishi and a few additional items I needed so I could just run in to the other location for cake only.  

While I am persuing the suishi counter and gabbing on my cell... A friendly lady wearing an Earth Fare shirt approached me at the suishi counter and asks if I had a scavenger hunt sheet...I politely said ""no"" and indicated that I was in a bit of haste but ...""thank you"".  So she then goes on to say.... are you done with your shopping and I sheepishly answer...Yes... and then she says....WELL LET ME BY YOUR GROCERIES TODAY...WHAT A HOOT!  

So needless to say, I only had about $35.00 bucks worth of grocery in my cart because Sunday is grocery day in my house....But it really was a great way to show appreciation for customers.  I was so tickled,,, thinking I may need to purchase a powerball ticket today huh!!! 

But as always, a great clean and friendly environment that warrants many returns."
Positive	Fun, energetic vibe, make a reservation if possible or be prepared to wait.  Favorite dishes of the night were beef tartare, fried chicken, black cod and char siu ramen.  Ramen broth was very flavorful and good.  The grilled table steak and asparagus with bacon was pretty good too.  The shrimp tempura, chicken with plum sauce and grilled squid was ok.  Sappora beer comes in huge liter glasses or pint size on tap.  The sake bombs are fun to do.  I would definitely come back here again.
Positive	PMG is a great community management company. I've been the board of our subdivision, Arizona Pravada, out of Gilbert. PMG, especially their representative Julie Cowand, is always there for our community's need. Julie is GREAT to work with and incredibly talented at keeping our community on track and looking fantastic. Sadly, due to health reasons, I'm required to sell my home and move to a different area, but I am ever grateful to Julie and PMG for their wonderful service.
Positive	Best seafood you will ever get. All the products are amazing and fresh. You can pickup the fish/shrimp/crab at the local farmers market or if you live outside the state you can have it shipped overnight. Love how the owner is actually the fisherman and is not just selling a product. Hands down best fish I have ever had :)
Positive	Anna did a great job on my haircut.  She was friendly and her skill was meticulous !   She listened and cut my hair to the right length .   Didn't leave feeling scalped
Positive	Had a wonderful birthday dinner last night with Mike, Stephani and Richard and from drinks to dessert I was not disappointed . The lobster bisque was excellent as was. The crab stuffed shrimp. Server could been just a bit more personable .
Positive	Solid service, their draft beers & ciders are outstanding, and always good healthy food options.  BJ's is always a good choice for a business lunch, after work beer, or a nice dinner.  I've been to at least 5 locations and always impressed.
Positive	Family decided we wanted some Chinese for lunch.  So what do I do, jump on Yelp of course!  This place exceeded all of our expectations!  Great service and delicious food.  As said by others, I'll agree this was some of the best orange chicken I've ever had!!
Positive	I love great BBQ and this spot hit the mark . The ribs are out of this world good and the mac and cheese was melt in your mouth great. Very cool little North Carolina stop that I would recommend to anyone looking to grab a quick and good lunch in the area.
Positive	I love Babbitt Motor Werks, I have been a client of theirs for over 10 years.  Nate always gives me more that I ask for in making sure that my car is performing well.   Once, he even came out to the shopping center I was broken down at and gave me a jump, and then finished up with replacing the battery!  Jenn runs a tight ship and I get top notch service from them!  I would highly recommend!
Positive	"Wow, wow, wow! Giuseppe's on 28th isn't fancy looking but the food is absolutely wonderful. The place is small and so they clearly have high quality control because everything was off the charts delicious. The sign out front about being on the Food Network is a bit corny, but don't let that stop you - this is the real deal.

We started the evening with the squid in white wine and one taste had me thinking about building a shrine to its greatness. The squid was so fresh and tender, the tomato sauce had a deep richness and sharp spice, and the peas (courtesy of Tuscany) were a stroke of regional genius. You'll never eat fried squid again - this is the only way to go. We ordered the garlic bread to sop up every drop of tomato sauce.

We tried the bruscetta which is prepared on the most wonderful bread you will ever taste. My wife said it is from Willo? I'm not sure ,but I was thinking maybe heaven? You get 4 different slices - the one with prosciutto, fig and goat cheese was magnificent.Then the dinner. You must try the ""as seen on the Food Network"" Osso Buco. Oh my God - this was the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Parked on a bed of home made noodles was the most extraordinary marinated meat with a complex tomato-based sauce that could bring Michaelangelo back from the dead to declare his entire lifes' work a failure in comparison to this work of culinary art. Savor the beauty. My wife had the manicotti, which because of the fine tomato sauce and fresh noodles, was excellent.

We finished the meal with tiramisu. After one taste I laughed out loud at anyone that would give this place a negative review. That would be the definition of a shill. Giuseppe's on 28th is not the fanciest, but it is the best Tuscan-Italian food you will eat in Phoenix. Delizioso! We also thought it was pretty cool that the owner walks around and makes sure everything is perfect. It was!"
Positive	I have loved eating at this place since the first time that I ordered the rolled tacos. All the food tastes great. My favorites so far are the breakfast burritos which are enormous in size and served all day and I also liked the the rolled tacos which come with the delicious rice and beans. I have never had a bad experience ordering from this place. They raised the prices recently but the food is still good for the price. The guac that comes on the rolled tacos is kind of bland but adds to the delicious greasiness. It's also open til 2 am so the late hours were perfect for college students or a late night run for burritos when nothing is open. Definitely a great find!
Positive	"I don't usually get my nails done out of fear of getting an infection, but this place was great. It was very clean and the staff were very friendly. It also lacked the usual smell of nail salon which was a pleasant supply. The tools used all looked clean and well kept. 

They were quick and friendly to get my nails done. My nails look amazing and they didn't cut my skin or anything.  I will most definitely be going back to them for my nails in the future! My only suggestion, get there early or call ahead for an appointment because they seem to get pretty busy, for good reason!"
Positive	A few weeks ago my bestfriend was turning 21, so I last minute looked for a place to get a blowout. SO happy that I found this place. Super easy to book an appointment online. The location at Town Square is convenient and the salon is gorgeous. I had my hair done by AJ, she is amazing!!! The head massage felt great and they let you choose a hair oil, I went for coconut- smells so good! She did a fantastic job and is an absolute sweetheart. I cant wait to have another reason to go back! And to top it all off, a super affordable price. Go! You won't leave disappointed
Positive	Loved this place. It was me and my families first time here. The pizza was amazing. It was hot and fresh and you could taste every ingredient. I prefer it over a lot of other franchise pizza chains! Everyone was nice and helpful. Laser tag was awesome and challenging for points. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the long and unorganized situation with the indoor go karts. There was a lot of younger kids on the karts that kept having accidents and when that happened everyone on the track has to stop. They should have young children on the karts and then pre-teens, teens and adults so we can get our FULL money's worth.
Positive	"While on a short weekend trip to visit my son, we looked up restaurants in Chandler to grab a bite to eat.  We saw San Tan Brewing Company, checked out the menu online and decided to go for a Sunday early lunch.  They have an extensive menu, and also offer a small ""brunch"" menu.  We ordered the Bloody Mary's, OMG they were one of the best I've EVER had!!!   On the appetizer menu, they have an appetizer called ""Raspberry Stuffed Mushrooms"".  My son ordered these, I thought I sounded a bit strange, but they were DELICIOUS!!  We raved to our waiter about how yummy they were and he said that come January, they will most likely be taken off the menu!   You have to try these before the go away!!!  Great place to kick back and watch football or any sporting event!!  We will be back!!"
Positive	"Simply put, the food is outstanding. Sandwiches to die for on some amazing bread. I haven't had sandwich bread this good since I was in Europe last year. They make everything fresh. On the way to work today I grabbed 6 Puff Pastries. So flaky they were unreal. No I didn't eat them all.
I've had sandwiched there and some deserts. A few things look odd but try them. Things here are not what they seem and it's all delicious. The smoothies are so good. My treat today after having a tooth pulled. 
$3.75 for a sandwich and $7.50 for the combo. Amazing prices."
Positive	"I've seen every type of show at the High Noon, and I can conclude that it's definitely my favorite place to see music in Madison.  There's several reasons why nearly every experience i've had there has been positive.  It all starts with the staff.  Every night I've gone there, the doormen have been very polite, the bar(s) never take too long to serve you, and the bartenders sometimes strike up great conversation on slower nights.  

The High Noon also consistently features a solid lineup of acts that you will want to see.  They feature all genres from indie rock to hip-hop to metal to punk to bluegrass and everything in between.  Some of the names they get are small, but others are legendary or breakout acts that you'll otherwise never see in such an intimate space.  The space itself is good, whether you like to get up close and personal with your favorite artist, or want to sit at a table from the second level.  Either way, every spot  (except behind the pillar in the middle of the venue) gets you a good view of the artist and sounds stellar.  And while we're discussing space:  The bathrooms are very clean, which is refreshing to see when the standard for a music venue is just barely usable.

As for prices, the High Noon is more than reasonable.  There's plenty of good microbrews to choose from, and none of them are ever over $5.  The tickets are almost always worth the price of admission for the caliber of acts they bring, especially since Chicago and Milwaukee both would charge higher ticket prices.  Sometimes there's shows that don't charge any cover or only cost $5, so they're sometimes worth checking out on nights where there's not much going on.

Overall:  The High Noon Saloon is awesome.  You'll initially come to see your favorite act, but you'll keep coming back for the great atmosphere and service."
Positive	Tom Cropp was extremely great with my family and myself. Yes the outside is not ery welcoming. Believe me as soon as my family and I saw the outside we were not very happy. My uncle was brought here from the hospital and my mom and I came from out of town to help my grandparents. Tom is great he completely walked us through the extrememly painful process. I do hope that they move or get a better location. It is very industrial and not very welcoming on the outside. Tom helped us so much. He went out of his way to make sure we knew he would help us in every way possible. We liked him so much that we asked him to be the mc for our memorial. He was not able to but instantly knew someone who was able and willing. Thank you Tom. I asked tom if he could relay a message to my uncle. He said do one better and write him a letter. I will put it with him when he is going to be cremated. He let me know that he recieved it and it was three pages.Thank you so much Tom.
Positive	"for the price, you really can't complain. i had the pleasure of staying in a connecting room with fellow yelp elite'r and the review below, Kenny L.

two connecting rooms, with everything the normal vegas rooms have. I look for odd qualities in a hotel room so i'll share

1. the beds were a little soft, i prefer really firm beds for extreme support on my ailing back after dancing my booty off all night but the comforters were very plush and warmer than inside the devils ass.
2. both of the irons in BOTH of our rooms were broken. stttrrriiike uno
3. combine that with the tiny flatscreen TVs that look silly compared to all the space next to them? strrrrike deuce equaling -1 star.
4. the showers are spacious and yes, like Kenny L. says the water pressure is low. however lets not forget, Las Vegas is the DESERT.. water is scarce so stop crying you sissy. get in, get clean, get out.
5. the view was great, though the windows are situated in weird spots, like half of it is cutoff and it ends into the wall? the connecting rooms basically share a long window so its really awkward... put it in the middle to maximize viewing pleasure? (again, like Kenny L. says, no fresh air.. then again NO HOTELS in vegas have windows that open because PEOPLE JUMP) ..sissy x2
6. theres a ton of different amenities downstairs, restaurants, convenience stores, slots, tables, etc.. but the area i frequent most often is the sports book betting room.. TI's is great, and during other trips where i've stayed at other hotels i've came to TI just to lay down a few stacks on the squad about to ball during the day.
7. room service is trippy.. even having a privacy sign hanging on our front door, they called to check on whether or not we wanted our room serviced. take it how you want, a privacy sign means we don't want service, don't bother us? ...but they double checked? ehh, whatever.. not trippen.

lastly, some girls we knew had a suite upstairs and it was very spacious. a double bathroom, sofas, and they rolled in two pull out beds. they fit a ton of females in there and if they kept it cleaner it would have been SOLID.
if they keep sending us deals, i'll consider it. if not, theres plenty of other hotels on the strip with similar prices that are a lot nicer.

REMAIN COMPETITIVE TI!"
Positive	"My husband and I just went in for the first time and were not disappointed. I have been experiencing very uncomfortable neck and shoulder pain (probably from working out and sitting too long) and my husband has always had back and shoulder pain (probably from being hit by a car years ago and working out, too.) 
Lena is a pain specialist, and although it was painful for her to workout my husbands issues, he gained more rotation in his shoulder for the first time in years. She spent time testing different muscles to identify the issue and then working on pressure points to correct it. She was nice and very helpful! She told my husband how to correct his workouts moving forward.
I worked with Kayla and she was very nice and professional. She immediately saw my forward posture and knew my neck muscles were stretched so she worked on my chest and neck. I also got a quick full body massage. Although I am a bit sore today I feel better and am able to roll my neck back without that obvious discomfort. Kayla also showed me a chest stretch I should be doing to help correct my chest/posture issue.
I am curious to see how I feel after the soreness and toxins subside!
The shop is small and clean, it isn't showy- it's not a spa. They're there to help you, not dazzle you with pictures ;)
We will both go back in the near future for corrective massage therapy again.
Don't just go in for relaxing massages, go here to correct the underlying issues too!"
Positive	Bruce Brown's Catering is top notch at any event I've been at - weather it's casual, business, or formal - the care they give to any client is top-notch.  I would  refer them without question to anyone who's looking for a caterer.  You can't go wrong with their company, they'll give you a wonderful experience.
Positive	The food was delicious and the service was amazing. We will definitely return. We had the greka for an app, I want to start making his at home! The. The house salad was to die for, and finally the entrees! The artichoke salmon was amazing and so was the stuffed shells spinachi. We were so full we were not able to even order dessert. We will come back to try those out! I have stopped by and gotten coffee many times prior to this, and I have always been very pleased with it. I think I have a new favorite spot to eat.
Positive	Fair prices.  Full vegan menu!  Nice sized drink menu.  I have been to this location twice, both times I ordered from the vegan menu and was happy with my selections.
Positive	My boyfriend booked this hotel for Super Bowl weekend. I was a little hesitant because there wasn't a casino.  I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Aria is very close walk to Vdara and you don't even notice that  that there isn't a casino.  The rooms are very nice and bed is super comfy. I probably wouldn't stay here for a girl's weekend, but this was the perfect spot for a couple's weekend. There was a little store on the first floor that had a variety of alcohol and food options. The prices were very reasonable and not the normal Vegas overpriced casino options.
Positive	"The buffet had so many different choices, and everything I tried was delicious! 
The service was excellent, every sever was so friendly.  I barely waited in line for the buffet (even at dinner time).
There desserts were phenomenal!
I highly recommend the buffet if you are in Vegas, it satisfies any craving you may have!"
Positive	"It's the one cafe along West Queen West that always has customers and I think it's the owners and their unique touch that makes the difference. 

On a sunny day like today the place is packed, and people are sitting outside on the benches. I order a macchiato and as I wait for my drink, I check out the gorgeous copper tin roof l, and stained glass. 

The drink comes, accompanied by a soda water on the side. There are fresh cut flowers at my table. And as I look out and watch life go by on Queen West, I realize:

I could get used to this."
Positive	"What a lovely place! I would refer anyone here looking for a home that feels like resort-style living. I had lunch and a tour here and the staff were very attentive and cheery! The chef was as good as any that run my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale. If you know anyone looking for a beautiful place to live, thus is it!
April in Phoenix"
Positive	I came here for a mid-week lunch at 11:45 and the service was excellent.  We had waters on our table as soon as we sat down.  The waiter came to our table almost immediately.  I loved all the sandwich and wraps options on the menu.  I had a hard time deciding but I selected the Veggie Wrap.  It was packed full of delicious fresh crispy vegetables like shredded carrots, jicama, cabbage, black beans, avocado, and tomato.  It came with a sauce that had a slightly vinegar and sweet taste.  The sandwiches all come with a side of either sweet potato fries, homemade potato chips, or side salad.  Prices for the sandwiches are in the $8 ballpark.  The wraps are very large and you can easily get full on half a wrap and take the other half to go.  They offer seating on their covered patio or inside. The inside is basically like sitting outside since they open up the whole wall to the outside.  It makes for a very pleasant airy fresh environment.  The restaurant offers a private parking lot in the back, and there is side street parking all around, plus public parking lots nearby.
Positive	We ate here for breakfast during our stay at bellagio in October. Food was very good but slightly over priced for breakfast (70$ for 2 with no alcohol) but that is expected for a place like this. We came around 9am on a Tuesday and there was no wait, service was quick. I got the crab cake Benedict and my wife the Belgian waffle, both were very good portions.  Worth checking out but if your looking for a cheap breakfast this is not the place.
Positive	"Great hot pockets and beer!  I don't know what pasties are but the best way to describe them is gourmet hot pockets or calzone.  The menu offers many different kinds of pasties - steak, pork, lamb, Italian, meatball, Mexican, veggies, etc for about $10.  They also have soups, salads and sides.  This place was already busy around 5pm on a weeknight.  The place was big on the inside and very dark.  Service was friendly and fast.  There's happy hour daily between 3p-6p where you can save $1 off draft beer, wine and liquor.

Four Peaks - $6 for 20oz local beer.  Light and refreshing.
Vindaloo Lamb $11 - Tasty and slightly spicy.
Oggie $9.25 - Delicious steaks and potatoes! I like the side of gravy that came with it.

Easy parking in the strip mall parking lot.

Positive	The nicest gay bar in Pittsburgh. Very nice bartenders, Arthur, Brett, Larry, Nick, Cole, Jonas, Travis, Will and Bill are great! The back patio is beautiful!  The food is awesome! I recommend it!
Positive	"Gonna be a long one.

Came for friend's b-day, so we had a big long table out in patio.
Also Free Valet parking on arrival. 

Environment: love the aesthetics and factory feel and decor.
good for groups and couples. Modern.

Service: friend and quick. Fast refills. 

Pricing: overall on the more pricier side. 

bathroom: love the M/F combine private bathrooms with a sink in each one. 

Food: 
prosciutto bruschetta  -$10.5
had a bite of this. There's a lot going on with a bite. first bite the  prosciutto and crescenza cheese is what you get. As you continue biting down, you get to this asparagus and and grana padano. So mouth full of cheese. If I had to get one appetizer, see the next one. 

Crispy Calamari $13.5
Get it!
not too much crusting that you don't taste the calamari. Just enough crush that doesn't hide the calamari. the lemon vinaigrette is legit. 

White truffle garilc bread $12
didn't get to sample this until after it got cold...so harder to judge, Probably better when hot. But I could pass on this appetizer, 

I personally had the strozzapreti - $18.5 consisting of the chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, pine nuts, and Parmesan cream. overall remind me of chicken Alfredo, but not. The noodle are STROZZAPRETI  which are elongated cavatelli. never had this kind, but I do like it. It is able to soak up the sauce. Chicken was grilled nicely, not dried, but juicy. The Parmesan cream sauce was not overwhelming to where you might get full of it before you're done with the dish. toasted pine nuts sprinkled in for extra dimension crunch. And mushroom throughout each bite. Pretty good. 

Chicken pesto with zucchini noodle - $17
had a taste of this. If you are wondering about zucchini noodle, don't hesitate to use this kind. 

diver scallops $25
mmm, had a bite of this as well. Big juicy, succulent and cooked to the right amount that the scallops melts in your mouth. Do recommend. 

Roasted salmon $23 
had a bite of this as well. again. Spot on with the cooking. Salmon wasn't dried and cooked just right. flavor was there but not overwhelming. Just salmon done right

Do recommend this place. 

PS
did not get to try the pizza. 

I was full also."
Positive	I'll rate my experience a 5 star rating. The lady I had was so considerate and well trained. It was my favorite massage so far. I opted for just the small amount of time in my back since I more of a leg/foot/ shoulders/hands person. It was great. My husband however did not like the lady who attended him :(
Positive	"I came here for dinner for a friend's birthday and it pretty much met my expectations, based on what I had read and heard previously. We ordered the prix fixe menu and found that the portions were not as large as we had expected. That being said, the taco was flavourful, the vegetarian shepherds pie was well worth it, and the dessert (cake) was rich and moist. 

As part of a big group, I found that the service was not as good as I would've liked. It did take us a while to flag down our server at times, and she seemed to be a bit overstretched. We were unable to use the Yelp check in coupon because we ordered from the prix fixe menu. Though I understand that, it was frustrating that we had presented the coupon earlier in the meal and only found out that we weren't able to use it right when we got the bill. 

I would definitely return to try their breakfast/brunch prix fixe -- which is essentially their Summerlicious menu -- however I would probably try to avoid coming at a very busy time. In summary, good food at a reasonable price and a convenient location, though a little on the noisier side."
Positive	"If you want to get Meat wasted you've come to the right place! I can't believe I have driven past this place countless times and failed to see it. What a hidden gem in Chinatown. I know you're thinking, an Argentinian restaurant in Chinatown that's legit?! Well yes, yes it is. It's also a deli and mini market. Upon entering you'll see a huge display deli case full of meats, cheeses, empanadas etc, to the right is a mini market that sells various dry goods, drinks etc. 

Our server who greeted us upon entering told us to sit where we liked and she took our drink order right away. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order but we browsed the menu anyway. I'm curious about the Italian dishes they serve but I'm almost certain we will be ordering the grilled meats again. We were brought some bread and chimichurri upon menu browsing. I'm a little disappointed it wasn't warmed or toasted but the chimichurri made up for it. Flavorful oil with herbs and garlic. Just be careful to not to over indulge you will get full quick. Take my word for it ;) 

We went ahead and ordered the Parrillada Martin Fierro which consists of kalbi,skirt steak, flap meat and filet mignon. We also added sausage since I didn't come with it. Also and two orders of Spanish rice which is a la carte. One order was not enough for the both of us. We came hungry though.  

They brought over the meat feast and man oh man! I can't state how much I enjoyed this. Cooked a perfect medium so it was still juicy and pink inside. So delicious yet seasoned simply so the meat can stand on its own. My favorite was the filet but all the meats were really good. At one point in the meal my fiancé mentioned he was meat wasted! In a good way of course. Drizzle the meat with chimichurri and eat it with the rice that soak up the juices from the meat. Honestly it was the best meal I've had in a long time and my mouth is watering just reminiscing. I will definitely be back to try the other meat platters as to decide which one is my favorite. Love this place!"
Positive	Great drinks, great food, great music, cool vibe. I've been here twice - a Saturday night with bands playing and a Wednesday night with a smattering of bar patrons. The busy night was a cluster, there was no hostess/host to be seen, and the bar tenders were rude (wouldn't even make eye contact while we stood waiting at the bar for 5 minutes). To be fair, it was so busy they were just trying to keep their heads above water, but it was irritating. Our other visit was awesome and both our waiter and the bartender were super nice! Would highly recommend the wings & fried pickles. Drink-wise, the Mai Tai, Tiki Underground Mai Tai, Jet Pilot were all quite good!
Positive	My wife and I received a gift card for a ride with Turf Soaring, and it was awesome. My wife did the 5,000-foot scenic ride and enjoyed taking the controls and piloting the craft.  I did the 4,000-foot aerobatic flight, and it was among the most fun activities I've done (up there with racing cars, motorcycles, sky-diving, and parasailing). For the aerobatic flight, you need to don a parachute before climbing in the cockpit.  After the briefing, we towed up behind the other plane, released, and then the instructor did a series of aerobatics -- starting with a roll and a loop, and then a cloverleaf (loop with a 90-degree turn).  Then i took the controls and got to fly, which was fun. I had the option of continuing to fly or turning over the controls for more stunts, so I chose B. We then did a roll, a half-roll (flying upside down for a lot longer than i thought we would!), and my personal favorite, a hammerhead... basically diving steeply to gather speed, then climbing vertically until just before stall, and then peeling off left and diving again.  On many times through the flight, i felt my face flapping under the g-forces (we hit about 4 G's), and felt more like a fighter-pilot than I ever thought I could.  Extremely fun!  Our instructors were both exceptionally nice, knowledgeable and patient.  We had a blast.
Positive	The staff here at Red Rock Dentistry are amazing! Very friendly and extremely professional. The Dentist are also masters of their trade. I have never experienced any pain or discomfort from any procedure so far. I highly recommend this dentist office.
Positive	We had a lovely brunch here. Being Sunday late morning, they were crazy busy. With that said, they got us in right away and hustled to get everyone served quickly. We sat in an outdoor area which was covered, so it was warm. The food was good and serving size was massive. I ordered eggs Benedict and held the cheese, but added mushrooms. Yum!! It was served with some delicious breakfast fries and a huge bowl of fruit. The one downfall was the eggs were cooked all the way through, so there was no runny yolk. I'm not a local, so maybe that's how this dish would be served throughout the region?!? Regardless, you should check this place out!
Positive	Great BBQ.  Very nice place with great food.  Ribs were delicious that fell off the bone.  Also the brisket was great.  Nice staff.  And then the little suprise of sugar cinnamon donuts for desert.  Kind of expensive but not too bad.  I will be back.
Positive	I love it when a restaurant owner (Franco) is as involved in running a business as this place. His Italian accent made it even better. Even while being the only bartender, he was still attentive (I was sitting at a table in the bar area). The food was reasonably priced and quite good. I do wish the tomatoes on the Caprese were a little riper, but the huge slabs of mozzerella made up for it. The decor is cozy and inviting. I will be back.
Positive	"If you like meat, friendly service, and more meat then go here. My advice is to get there early because there is literally always a line out the door when they open. But not to worry...if you do have to wait they offer you bottled water and you get to marvel at their tremendous smoker. 

Fantastic food (I highly recommend the Jefe Sandwich with Brisket and a side of the jalapeño cheddar grits), super friendly staff, and pretty reasonable prices. 

Don't be put off by their location. It's an ""up and coming"" area. 

GO HERE! You won't regret it."
Positive	Great store. Clean, friendly service and good prices! Best part is free childcare! Gives you up to 90min to shop kid free! Video monitors are set up around the store so I can keep an eye on the kids.
Positive	"This is the top of the crop, the best of the best. The decor is Western, smart and tasteful. It is maintained very well and the residents smile and say hello, they seem genuinely happy living here.

I love the lounge and library, which has so many books and well organized. 

The restrooms are. Try presentable and clean.

I enjoy visiting the 1/ year old tortoise. ( c pics)"
Positive	"Very nice staff and doctors 
Honest with you and doesn't sugar coat. Gives the best advice for helping with your vision and suggestions on how to improve your vision at work as well."
Positive	"Absolutely the Best! 
I have been there.......a number of times and they have a variety of flavors, yes I have tried them all. Universally the cake is light and moist, the frosting varies depending on the cupcake but they are all good and really compliment the flavor of the cupcake. My favorite is the Coconut no the Salted Caramel no no its the Smores! Well maybe they all are, I dont have to choose just one now do I :)
I will travel miles and miles to get one and I am always glad I did. My next review may have to be a personal trainer but i'm ok with that!"
Positive	"I like this place... Definitely cozy, small space with couches and comfy seats in the corner.  Their chai is delicious and I love that they use the loose, real chai and not some crap syrup or powder. 

Being that they're known for their crepes, I ordered their (sweet) ricotta with lemon zest and dark chocolate. It was good and it was a good portion I couldn't finish it! What I didn't like though was there was hardly ANY ricotta. Almost an indiscernible amount. Other than that I love the place and will be back for sure!"
Positive	Busy place for sure, wait  staff friendly and attentive. Fun interesting atmosphere lots of tv's to watch. I had the philly cheese steak it was good but nothing spectacular, I've had better and worse. But over all an ok place to eat, decent value for your money I'd go back again someday I'm sure.
Positive	"We've had our eye on the Lobster Pot since it opened and finally gave it a go for our daughter in laws birthday.

We were greeted by their very friendly hostess, and then by our server.  He was very attentive throughout our meal.

For our appetizer we ordered the Blue Point oysters.  They were generous in size, clean and had already been cut out for us.  VERY good, although a little pricey at $33 for a dozen.  Our server also delivered a nice, warm French bread that was very good.  

Our selections included the Swordfish special, Lobster Roll, Scallops, and Oyster Po'boy.  All were excellent!  

My only complaint was their desserts.  While very good in flavor, they were outrageously priced at $9.00 a piece and $7.50 for the small sliver of pecan pie.

We will definitely be back, but will be skipping dessert!"
Positive	"Was at the playoff game last night where the Cards pulled out a victory over the Packers in OT.  This is the 3rd game I have attended at this stadium and the 1st ever NFL playoff game.  The environment was electric.  The prices were higher than what I though was usual for food and drinks.  Perhaps it was just the playoff prices, but for $40 my wife and I got 4 waters, 1 bag m&ms, 1 thing of red vines, and a $15 bag of mixed nuts that was cold and honestly not very good.  

Now that is out of the way.  We have sat in the end zone twice and it was decent.  We were on the first row of the ring of honor last night and it was great.  Could see the entire field and had a blast.  

Definitely excited about purchasing season tickets for next season.

Positive	"I am going to give this place a five star review for this one dish. I've never seen it anywhere else. I've never tried anything else here because of the unbelievable awesomeness packed into it.

What is this tasty tasty dish you speak of? Pollo Amables. 

It's essentially the chicken and veggies that would be in a fajita, but they're covered in cheese and sautéed with bacon. YES BACON! in Mexican food. 

Go and order it, it's awesome,

I had a margarita, I ordered the cheap one and it tasted ok, and it was super strong. Spend the money for the upgrade for the better booze"
Positive	Thank you Jess for my amazing lashes!   The open fans are perfect, and you guys help bring my lashes back to health after mistakenly going somewhere else.  I will never go anywhere else again! I can't wait to come back again and again!  The lashes are super soft and luxurious!  Thank You Kyou Beauty Team!  You all are awesome!
Positive	"My family and I were driving down Las Vegas Blvd. to grab some dinner. Our initial pick was some burger joint off the strip, but we saw a sign that said ""D'Pinoy Joint"" and of course, my parents got excited so we had to come try it out.

We parked in front of the restaurant, or so we thought (haha), but it turned out to be the back side of the restaurant. The lit ""OPEN"" sign in the back kind of threw us off! But, it's ok. It wasn't a far walk to the front.

The food: My family and I ordered the lumpia, adobo rice, sizzling pork sisig (yum!), bulalo (hella yum!), sweet and sour fish, and the halo halo for dessert. The food was pretty good! I've had my share of filipino food and I got to admit, this place is one of my top choices. Who would have thought to put an egg in the middle of the sizzling sisig?? Too bad they're not in the Bay Area (California)!

The service: The staff was very attentive. We were greeted the moment we came in and throughout the whole time my family and me were there, Paul (I believe that's his name lol) had always checked up on us to make sure we were ok. Super friendly guy!

5 stars for the good food and the amazing service."
Positive	"I was blown away by this show. I have never been so entertained during an entire show before. It was the highlight of my trip. 

Sometimes I have ADD sitting for long periods of time. During Love there is always something going on from the moment it starts to the end. It was crack for my eyes, ears and mind I wanted more. There is music, acrobatics, flying and fabulous props. 

I bought the ""cheap"" seats row FF and two tickets were $195.00. Our seats were great. There isn't a bad seat in the house. I recommend purchasing directly from Mirage it was more expensive through the other ticket agents like Ticketmaster. I bought them before the trip and picked up the same day as the show at the box office. 

The staff were very nice and did a wonderful job getting people ushered in and out quickly. 

Also, the line is very long to get into the show. We were told to get there 30 minutes before it started. There were already hundreds of people in line. The line snaked through the casino all the way to the gift shop. I recommend showing up when the show time is that way you won't have to wait in line."
Positive	This place is great! They have a breakfast menu and an espresso bar, as well as lunch wraps and salads. This is in addition to the fine chocolates. I also saw a note about an evening open mic and a full bar with interesting cocktails. They have an outdoor patio in front with shaded tables, as well as lots of space to sit and work in the air-conditioned space inside--just ask for the wifi password!
Positive	"The best sushi place in town hands down! Fish is always fresh and the customer service is always spot on! 

The sushi chefs are so friendly and make the experience the best! The manager and owner always make a point to say hi to us and ask us how we are doing. 

Keep it up!! Won't go anywhere else.... You shouldn't either trust me we have tried. Did work out, no place as good as sushi koma"
Positive	Excellent!! The chicken paprikash soup was out of this world... bread was amazing, the Cajun shrimp pasta was spicy, creamy and not fishy although the andouille had a bit of a beef stick bite to it. Beer selection wasn't bad and the wine selection was excellent. The Cuban sandwich was delicious as was the wedge salad. Nobody was disappointed with their meals. I think our waitress may have been on another planet but the food made up for the weird service. It wasn't bad... Just .... She was a strange bird. And the flies were annoying the entire time and never seemed to go away...while we were inside. Highly recommend for some good food in the middle of nowhere.
Positive	"Brew Tear Bar's five stars are well-earned. Not only are their drinks truly delicious, they go out of their way to make sure you are actually satisfied with it before you leave their cafe. I observed the brewers tasting (sanitarily via a spoon and a separate tasting cup) samples of their work to make sure it was okay.

I had the hot taro milk tea (no boba) and was blown away by the flavor. Unfortunately, Brew Tea Bar is on the other side of town from me, so I will not be able to get their drinks EVERYDAY as I would have wanted."
Positive	"Love Lulu's from the eclectic decor to the yummy food.  My husband and I love coming here on weekends. The coffee never seems to disappoint.  The smores latte, white mocha, and pumpkin are some of my favorites.  Hubby gets black coffee and enjoys it.  My go to is the Benecio Del Porko because its delicious and so different from what you can get at other restaurants.  Hubs usually gets the pastrami hash because it is that good.  The nutella croissant is to die for!  Sometimes we order ""one of those"" as a little breakfast appetizer...they are the best thing ever (they are sometimes the winning argument when we are deciding which breakfast restaurant to go to). The Captain America breakfast sandwich is a good choice too.  My husband things it's a little too salty, but I think it's just fine.  Lulu's Breakfast Burrito is a winner also.  The mix of flavors and the roast pork seem to set this apart from run of the mill breakfast burritos."
Positive	"Great place for an oil change. They don't provide you with coffee and a paper while you're waiting like Mr.Lube, however provide honest recommendations.

Wouldn't hesitate to come back for repeat service."
Positive	"Although I've been told the food here isn't that authentic, it's still one of my favorite Thai food restaurant in Toronto. I love the busy environment for dinner with one to two friends. I find if I go with too many people then you can't really hear what everyone's saying because it's loud. I especially love Kaosoi, a curry dish with noodles, for its rich flavor and balance between the texture of the noodles and fried noodles. I think their Thai ice tea and coconut water are good too. I never order the Thai ice tea just for myself since it's quite sweet but coconut water is a must if I'm having something spicy.

It's a good place to go with a close friend or someone who you know well. I find the place loud so if you're really trying to get to know each other you might not be able to hear them well."
Positive	"Just like my tip for the casino, ""Where is the actual business listing for this restaurant?"" I read most of the reviews and they all say Longhorn Cafe or Longhorn Restaurant. When I checked the place out, there is a big sign right above the place that says ""Chuck Wagon"". So why no one has done a listing is beyond me. The casino itself is a separate entity but when you go over the reviews, about 80 percent of it pertains to the restaurant.

So here's the first offficial review for this listing.

Like everybody else, I was drawn by the billboards off of Boulder Highway about their food specials. One example is the Barbeque Combo Plate for 9.99 which consists of 1/4 Babyback Ribs, Beef Brisket, and 1/4 rotisseried Chicken accompanied by Baked Beans and a mini Corn on the Cob. Another is Steak and Petite Lobster for 9.99 as well. They also have your basic steak and potatoes for 5.99 which is not a bad deal.

I got the Barbeque Combo because the picture from the billboard looked rather enticing. The Babyback Ribs were surprisingly tender and flavorful. The Beef Brisket was ok and the Chicken was a bit dry. All items were topped off with a drizzle of tangy barbeque sauce which I thought was pretty tasty. The corn was your basic corn and the baked beans tasted like it was from a can.

The restaurant itself is a little bit cozy meaning they got a decent amount of tables and booths kind of crammed together. So dont be surprised if you have to wait a bit especially for dinner. I went on a monday at 11:45 am and only waited for about 2 minutes.

As for the service, nothin major to complain about or take my hats off to. You do get what you pay for in terms of service. I recommend you not be in any hurry if you plan on eating here. Overall, the staff is friendly from my first impression.

Some random info: These guys are open 24 hours and you dont need a player card to get the food deals. The bathroom is in the casino to your right when you exit the restaurant. Occasionally you will get a whiff of the second hand smoke coming from the casino, especially if you have a bunch of smokers out there on the slots and tables.

In conclusion, I will definitely come back to try their other specials and most definitely will come here if I have friends or family that just want decent food at good prices."
Positive	I used this company to paint 105 feet of exterior stucco brick wall. They were prompt in contacting me and responsive to my needs.   I would recommend this company and use them again.
Positive	I wanted a new A/C unit. A sales rep came to my home and explained the process to me and quoted me a price. I accepted and the work was completed as discussed and without incident. I put the installation on a payment plan that was interest free for one year. I paid it off within the year and the matter was closed... also without incident. The payment plan as not with the company... but with a 3rd party financial institution that deals solely with HVAC financing. It was a painless process. Oh... and we got a rebate check in the mail from the government, shortly after, for getting a more efficient unit.
Positive	"So I've been to Vegas plenty of times and was sick of eating blah food for breakfast and waiting till dinner time to enjoy the buffet or a fancy restaurant, so I did my research and also asked my local familia for some great recommendations and this was one of them!

I was hooked from the moment my girl told me about a cafe that served red velvet pancakes! (shout out to my naning Mary Rose F.!) So I knew it was a must... I am the queen of breakfast... I love breakfast for lunch and/or dinner :)

So we got there closer to closing time (2pm on weekdays) because nobody vacationing in Vegas gets up earlier than noon (well, definitely not me!) so we beat the morning congestion and were seated promptly. I guess we got lucky because I've read that the wait can get pretty bad.

I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my sweetheart ordered the s'mores pancakes. DAMN! Both were sooo good. The red velvet pancakes were like eating perfectly flattened cupcakes smeared with cream cheese syrup and whipped cream! Each bite melted in my mouth... perfection!  

The service was great too! My coffee cup was always filled and we didn't wait too long for our food to come out. Also, they were very accommodating and  even though we showed up closer to closing time, they didn't rush us at all which I appreciated very much. 

Definitely a must-try especially if you're visiting from out of town. Yeah, so it's located on the other side of town from the strip but it's definitely worth the drive!"
Positive	Im sad this place closed. It was a bit pricey, but they gave safelite employee 10% discount and the food was pretty bomb. Their bread is really good (although I wish they hadn't done away with the parmesan garlic bread that was my favorite) and I enjoyed their soups and unique root beer. I think the employees were nice and friendly. Now there is no where to eat as close by to my work : (
Positive	"After some ""less than stellar"" experiences with my hair, I am thrilled to say that I found an awesome stylist at Cielo!  Jenn is outstanding!  She's great at the basics (color, cuts and perms) and is always learning new techniques!  My hair has never looked better.  The shop is adorable - and you can even relax with some wine while you get your hair done.  Awesome experience.  Highly recommended."
Positive	This is a very well hidden & almost unknown gem. I'm a foodie & had to be sent to this establishment. The décor is nice but a little cramped of a space. We went on Saturday evening but were able to find a seat at a booth for the 4 of us. We had the spicy TNT burger which had the right amount of heat & spice but was super tasty with the fresh jalapenos & siracha mayo, we also had the Hangover burger with an over easy egg which was delightful with the potato hash & bang sauce dolled out on top. Highly recommended & good on a budget.
Positive	"Didn't eat here, just got a few margaritas at the bar! 
Upon us sitting down the bartender brought us each a menu and told us she would be back in a few to get our order, she also informed us we got there right when happy hour started! I love when bartenders give us a few minutes to order, because I always feel so rushed when we immediately sit down and they want our order. 
We got the house margaritas because they were 5 dollars and that was a deal we couldn't beat! 
The bartender made them quickly and they were delicious. Came in a cute little glass and had plenty of tequila, just how I like it!
The bartender was great, we would come back again just to get drinks from her!"
Positive	I love this restaurant. Their food is affordable and delicious ! But I hate that it's a cash only I wanted to buy two chicken apples but only had a $10.
Positive	So I haven't been to this show yet, but I have taken a couple of online courses from Jason and the value of his knowledge is worth it! He really knows his stuff and is able to communicate in a very clear and concise manner. The website quality isn't my favorite, but I have purchased classes and product from him and have been very pleased. He provides information for all sorts of safety measures to help you get off the x. This includes information and training for home defense, gun use and practice, survival driving, how to get free from duct tape, how escape handcuffs, how to create big out bags, how to have situational awareness, and what to do in common life threatening situations. I highly recommend him and his courses.
Positive	"What a perfect place for a date night! Love the quality of the food and the service! They sure know how to take care of you. Husband took me here for date night and we enjoyed not just the restaurant but walking the ground of the hotel where Roys is located. Very romantic. 

O.k. for the food, this is what we ordered:

For starters we ordered the Lobster potstickers drizzled in spicy togarashi miso butter sauce. It was really good, wouldn't say it was the best lobster potstickers I've had but they were good. Wish there was a little more lobster in the filling.

For the main course, I ordered the butter seared Georges Bank sea scallops with creamy coconut black rice with lobster essence. I have to say that the coconut black rice was so freakin' good they seriously should have it as a side item because it's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life and I'm not kidding. It's so full of flavor and the texture of the rice is A-FREAKIN-MAZING!

We will be back!!!"
Positive	It was surprising that we drive into town or Leetsdale or North Hills for Mexican food when so close to Plaza Azteca.  The different flavors in the dishes; the hospitable staff; and clean, pleasant environment.  So nice that each dish had it's own flavor.   We were probably their last table of the evening and they could not have been nicer and the food really fresh.  We had appetizers (empanadas, table side guacamole); beef and chicken enchilada's and fajita's... Their salsa is the best I have had outside of (forgive me, that well known place downtown across from Heinz Hall).  Yes, that good.  Nice to note also that their seating/lighting allows for people to have privacy.Sounds as though this family owned business will be opening another Azteca in Washington PA in the next few months.  Good Luck!
Positive	Wow. This place was outstanding. Alluring, romantic environment, great service and outstanding food. Went with a big group for a business dinner, but looking forward to coming back with my wife for a date night.
Positive	These folk always make my day at least 20% better. Always kind, thoughtful, and professional. Today I was lucky and showed up just as the Everything bagels came out of the oven. There is nothing quite like an untoasted Bruegger's bagel fresh out of the oven. Mine had the salmon cream cheese. Yum. Add the sunny disposition of the staff and you have a great place for quick eats. The coffee is good too. Free wifi.
Positive	I love Mexican food in fact I loved Mexican food so much I married a woman (back in 2007-2010 been free of the shackles for 6 years now) of Hispanic origin (Mexican). She cooked really good Mexican food but let me tell you this place is right up there in terms of authentic taste! The vibe you get when you walk in and the layout makes it feel authentic as well! Their horchata's are sweetened just enough to make you want more! Their chicken enchiladas...man don't let me get started I'm hungry now just thinking about it! All I can say is that if you read this review and you're not already on your way to the restaurant to try it out then you need to reevaluate your priorities! Juan's is the epitome of authenticity!!!!
Positive	Even with the young employees working they give good service. I had a couple questions about the menu as there was a wide variety of drinks. The cashier helped me find a good drink that satisfied my cravings. Boba was warm & sweet as it complimented my taro green milk tea with Oreo. Sweet & satisfying.
Positive	Just met the new bartender he called himself Danimal at first I thought he was weird , but then I realized I was just being rude because he was gosh darn sexier then me. He poured drinks like a man with bubble guts driving home (f ing FAST)! Now I know why he's called Danimal cause he's a beast! AMAZBALLS !
Positive	"Convenient location with nice amenities, but ridiculously slow service

Our group stayed at in three rooms at the MGM Signature Tower 1, floor 16.

SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: King-sized beds - comfy, clean and completely bright white with plush pillows. The couch in each room also unfolded into a bed. 

BATHROOMS: So spacious with its giant bathtub (with jets), shower, two sinks (more in the big corner room), and separate toilet area. There was even a mini TV!

OTHER SPACES: The corner room had a living room, kitchen and additional bathroom, while the adjacent hotel room had a kitchenette and just one bathroom. They connected through a mini ""hallway"" space, which could be locked from the main hallway of the hotel. 

My one complaint was on the lack of trash cans: there were only one small trash can in each toilet space and an additional one under the sinks in the kitchen/ette for each hotel room. 

The balcony was nice, overlooking the swimming pools of the MGM Grand. The never-ending river looked particularly awesome. It did get noisy each morning starting at 9 am, because the neighboring pool ""club"" started its loud music then.


SERVICE: Soooooo slow! We were scheduled to check in at 3 pm on a Friday, but they weren't ready for us until ~4:30 pm. The maid service, on the other hand, was great! They were careful and accommodating. I loved that they cleaned the bathroom counters and moved all of our toiletries and bags onto a medium-sized towel without mixing our toiletries. They also knew not to throw away plastic ziplock bags or rubber bands. Amazing. Internet was free and functional, which was really handy.


LOCATION: It's tucked behind the MGM Grand away from the strip, but the building is connected to the MGM Grand, which makes it convenient enough. The taxi ride from the airport seemed to differ a lot in price across all of us, ranging from about $18 to $31. Avoid using credit card too on taxis, because there's a $3 charge that the drivers never tell you about! Taking a taxi from MGM Grand was cheaper, though you will need to take your luggage across the casino area and mall area, then down a long corridor before you reach the towers of the Signature (15-20 mins walk, all in-doors)

VISIT DETAILS: Bachelorette party"
Positive	"My favorite sushi restaurant by far.

Happy hour is from 4-7 and amazing. They also have a reverse happy hour late night.

I've had really good service at the Kierland location... 

So pretty at night! Great atmosphere to go out and have some drinks and HEALTHY food with friends."
Positive	Being a huge boba lover, I have been searching Vegas for a spot I can love.  Although I've only tried two spots, this one is definitely better than the other.  I normally try basic flavors like classic milk tea or matcha milk tea just to see if the base is good or not.  I was able to get a sample of drinks that are not blended since they are easier to make samples from I guess.  So as I tasted the classic and matcha milk teas, they were way too sweet for my liking.  But in their defense I have worked my way down to zero sugars in my milk teas.  The basics were good.  The reason I had to knock off a star was because they aren't able to adjust the sweetness level.  Or maybe they dont know how?  But I'm assuming it's as easy as adding more milk/tea.  At least thats how I normally do it.  Just that option alone would be able to make a world of difference.  Another thing I thought was a bit weird was the fact that branded mason jars were sold but not especially made for drinking boba from.  If only the tops had holes made to fit a boba straw in it.... genius!  It's actually a common thing, where I'm from.  And it encourages being a little more eco friendly.  No cups to waste and the business could offer a small discount for bringing the jars back when ordering.  As far as the staff goes, the cashier was very friendly, answered all the extensive questions I had and went above and beyond in making sure I was pleased with my drink.  The price if the drink, even with the jar was still cheaper than some boba spots I've seen in my area!  Under 8$!  The location is really nice.  Its conveniently places between a bunch of modern shops with parking right outside.  I'd highly recommend anyone that likes boba to check this spot out.  They really are more than a boba spot but my review was purely based on the one drink I had.  If I have time I'll sure visit back fir their known mangonada and maybe some of the foods they serve as well.
Positive	They've just done a renovation on this place and it looks great. The food is really good and they always have daily food features. If you live in the area, it's definitely a good option for watching sports, grabbing a drink, or a quick bite to eat. They've added several large tvs to the place, so watching different games is no longer an issue. Food and drink prices are pretty standard.
Positive	Had a very thorough eye exam by Dr. Romaguera. She was very professional and knowledgeable . I was very impressed by the whole team at this location. Manny was extremely helpful and fitted my glasses perfectly! He had my glasses ready the same day!!  Thank you Manny!!! Also, Jackie helped me pick out great glasses and after a few days of having my new glasses she called to make sure I was satisfied with them. The service here is definitely 5 stars!! I highly recommend this location! Thank you Manny, Jackie and the whole team at Perale Vision!
Positive	"We met Dr. Maria Santabene shortly after she started working at WVH.  She is a wonderful veterinarian.  Well trained, direct, compassionate, caring, smart, and she has a great sense of humor.  She currently is caring for 3 of our family's dogs (out two and my son and his GF's).  They have presented with strange afflictions (giardia, some other weird worm, the need for our female gordon to be spayed at the age of 6, skin infections, etc.) and she has managed the diagnosis and treatment with self-confidence and a quiet assurance.

On occasions when necessary, Dr. Santabene has always returned phone calls in a timely manner and she explains things so non-vets can understand.

I highly recommend her.  Welcome back to Pittsburgh.  Just don't get too busy for Cayman, Mirabella, or Asher."
Positive	"Such a great first experience here! We came here for a girls night on a Saturday evening, the food service and the sommelier were fantastic! 

They were so kind and served us multiple orders of the fresh rosemary bread with olives along with our wine. We wanted to have a nice sweet wine with our pasta so the Sommelier suggested a Primitivo which paired beautifully. 

I also tried the Rigatoni, which was so fresh and full of flavour. I would definitely reccomended it!"
Positive	Been going to this gym the past 4 months and I have been quite satisfied with the workouts and the friendliness of the staff. The managers seem to be on top of their game and keep the equipment well maintained. Keep up the great work, EoS!
Positive	Pai is one of my favorite restaurant. I went there for my birthday and I love the decoration there. Good for groups! Their Tom Yum Kung is a must-try item! It surprises me with their flavor coz its acidic taste really embraces my appetite! I cannot stop eating it! Definitely go again. Tips - make reservation! Or go earlier because this place is super crowded.
Positive	This is the best Thai outside of Bangkok I've ever had, we've gone multiple times and although there's a chance you'll have a good wait for your food you have to remember it's a family run business, it's probably the same chef who makes your dish every time, not just anyone, which means the food is consitenly delishous and made with pride.
Positive	Sabores in the farmers market..........access to fresh ingredients means only great things.......Asada tacos are done just right.........Molé anything is delicious........fresh inhouse made tortilla chips.......guacamole mmmmmm......and a huge variety of salsas to choose from........never a long wait.........vegetarian tacos are the best in the city......no skimping here for non meat eating types.........oh and did I mention they use real mexican cheese mmmmmmmmmm.........no cutting corners at this place !!!!!
Positive	This is my second time here.  Had the Teatro last time and simply loved it.  Tried the salmon special this evening which was salmon atop lobster ravioli with a rose sauce and chunks of lobster.  My girlfriend had the Chicken Davida and was speechless.  She had it gluten free by substituting fried eggplant for kale.  I tasted some and it was great.  This is a neighborhood treat.  You can't go wrong with this place.  Service is great and attentive.
Positive	KoMex was so so delicious I enjoyed my kimchee rice and the bulgogi burrito.  I will definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and family...so yummy!! Will come again for sure!
Positive	"What a great little coffee shop.  Guess i really should say coffee and more.  Love all the art work, the very friendly staff, the great calendar of events they always have lined up.  

I fell on Jarrod's by chance and sometimes you just get lucky.
I hope their business thrives.  it is a great addition to downtown
Meas."
Positive	Had their hamburgers last night, and I have to say they were the best I've had in a long time.  I love the atmosphere in there and the staff was wondering.
Positive	"My gf and I did not know what to do on a frigid cold Saturday.  She told me that she had a group on for Corned Beef House.... so off we went. 

Immediately when we walked in there was this laid back, friendly kinda vibe.  With Sam Cooke and the James Brown playing in the background,  we enjoyed a large Smoked Reuben Sandwich and their Mochas (which totally hit the spot).  

This place is classic, unpretentious and just plain badass.  Love the decor, Great food, Great service, and Amazing Reubens."
Positive	"Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm, mmmm, mmm good!  Had lunch here with my hubby and teens to celebrate my birthday and I wasn't really that thrilled about going at first because another place was really my first choice.  We got there about 15 minutes before they closed after lunch so apparently they close at 2:30 and then reopen at 5:00.  They were very kind to us despite our timing and we were only ""rushed"" so that the kitchen staff could be done by 2:30 and leave.  We order three Pad See ew, two with tofu and no eggs, one with beef and for myself I decided to try the Massaman curry which comes with a crispy spring roll. My hubby ordered is tofu pad see ew with a level 4 spice, highest you can get and he enjoyed it but he said he likes the wider noodles that you typically get at other thai restaurants and I must agree with him. His portion size was good as well. My daughter had the same thing with a level 3 spice, wished she'd gotten the 4 but enjoyed it nonetheless.  My other daughter got the one with beef and enjoyed it but she was upset that she didn't really have enough noodles and I must agree.  It was a lot of beef and broccoli but very few noodles, bummer.  Now, on to my massaman curry, level 4.  Amazing!!  At first I looked at the portion size and it seemed really small but it wasn't because I ended up having enough to share with my hubby and daughter.  We did have to order another bowl of rice because most thai restaurants never give you enough rice it seems.  But it was sooooo good!  Great flavor, perfectly seasoned, hot and spicy!  I was pleased as punch with my selection. 
The waitress was really nice because she told me that if the kitchen hadn't closed she would have given me a dessert to celebrate but that next time I come in to remind her and she'd take care of me.  The meal with tax and tip cost us about 62 bucks which was a bit steep for a lunch that didn't include any appetizers, drinks or dessert so we may not come back much as a family but I'll certainly be back to get some more of the curry and maybe try a few other options but overall, it's worth a try for sure.  Enjoy!

That is all! (Don't forget to hit the useful, funny or cool button.  Would love the feedback.)"
Positive	I love this place. Yoga is a great way to relieve stress, get stronger, healthier, and I always leave feeling so good. The instructors are wonderful. Every class is different which makes it fun. I wish I had the time and money to go everyday.
Positive	Complimentary bread and olives were very tasty. I got the scallops which was good. The creme brûlée was excellent! We got to watch the water show outside from our seat indoor. I loved the lighting and atmosphere. I will definitely return.
Positive	Been here twice now and both times the food was good and tasty.  We had a group of 13 people and ended up with lots of left overs. I recommend this for families with kids and casual dinner night. Food is reasonably priced for Vegas restaurant. Recommend for casual dinner night with the kids.
Positive	"We have been here twice and the food is great. We love the grape leaves and my wife is a tough grader, but we had them on both visits. The 
baba ganoush is smokey and wonderful. Reasonable prices, nice people.
If you like mideastern food please give this a try."
Positive	I knew this place must be good when I went there for lunch on a Wednesday and the line was out the door at 11:20, so get there early!  I had the beef hard shell tacos and chips and salsa.  Everything was excellent and reasonably priced!  I would highly recommend going here!
Positive	"Being a resident of Vegas for over 14 years, I have eaten at most restaurants worth eating at in Chinatown. This by far is one of the best and authentic Taiwanese food we have in sin city. Beef roll is def worth trying. I usually get the pork chop rice plate, beef roll  and wonton soup for lunch. 

Pros: authentic, almost home cooking. Price is very reasonable. 

Cons: not much I can think of. But I will update my review if I discover any cons next time I eat there"
Positive	"Heaven on earth. *Pear & Gargonzola* The best vegas yelp ever. *Guava Smoothie* Yes, better than the Bellagio Fountains. *Banana Nutella Rocky Road* (yumm) The other reviews are not exaggerating. *Tiramisu* Missed the old store by one day. *Black Sesame* 
Now, in some boondocks location. *Mango Taji* Just set Google maps. *Ube (Purple Yam)* And make the pilgrimage. *Salted Butterscotch* Can I get a Hallelujah? *Cafe Latte*"
Positive	We have been here twice now. The service is excellent even when they are pack. The food is amazing we got the prime rib dinners the first time and a steak the second. Everything was amazing. Definitely one of our favorites
Positive	Wow just wow, my girlfriend found this place while working and said. We needed to try it out. So that is what we did and now will be making return trip after return trip to this Amazing Mom & Pop Italian Pasta Spot! Hand made Pastas and Sauces to die for. She had Fettuccine with Pink Diablo Sauce and I had lobster ravioli with clam and mussel red sauce. We had some amazing garlic bread and when I joking asked for a loaf of it the sop up the delicious sauce our waitress return with a plate of garlic beard which I put to use. I can not wait to go back and try a different combination of pasta and sauce. Vegas has some amazing Italian places and in my opinion Pasta Idea ranks right up the with best of them. Did I mention that both our plates were huge and it was under $50 for the entire dinner! simply fantastic.
Positive	The burgers are great! I had never had tried their food before, until a few weeks ago. My girlfriend was in the mood for a burger and she recommended this place. I decided to try one myself, and I'm glad I did because it was delicious. I will be coming back for more soon, can't wait to try something new of their menu. Keep up the good work!
Positive	We purchased 2 rolling sun screens from this awesome company about 4 years ago. We did not purchase them motorized but rather they opened and closed them manually with  attached chains. Over the years the chains have broken I believe 3 times. Everytime we called the company they had someone out within a week to replace the broken chain. And we live in Rimrock, roughly 140 miles north of Phoenix! The last time we had a problem,  they suggested that the screens be motorized so no chains to keep breaking. They came and picked up the screens, connected them to a motor, which required more parts than originally thought, returned a few weeks later,  installed the newly motorized screens, ran all the electrical, and left a remote contol. ALL for only $125 !! We are astounded by their concern, willingness to make it right, and certainly the cost of what should be the perfect solution! I HIGHLY recommend this product and especially this company! This type of service is very rare now days!
Positive	I always come here when im feelin sick or about to be sick. I get the recovery drinks and boy do they do wonders! I love them! Good prices too. Really healthy!
Positive	"Pros: what a cute cute cute place to eat breakfast. Perfect day to eat breakfast on the patio. Good services. 

Cons: long wait. Luckily we were able to explore the Trader Joe's and Whole Foods in the same shopping complex."
Positive	"Super in love with this place! The staff is super friendly and inviting. I will be getting all my waxing needs here from now on. 

I needed a last minute appointment & they were able to accommodate me 30 minutes after I gave them a call. 

When I first walked in, I was greeted by Mayeli. She seemed like a genuinely nice person & was very helpful. 

I got my wax from Shaina. She is pretty amazing. She had some entertaining stories to tell to distract the pain. She told me how she's a perfectionist, which I love because I am one myself. 

I will definitely be coming here again. Service and product is amazing.  Overall a wonderful experience!"
Positive	Great variety with pictures on the menu helping narrow your choices if you're unsure what you want or just wanting to try something menu.  Price is reasonable amd service is always friendly.  Facility has a nice ambiance and well kept.
Positive	"Hole-in-the-wall place that will satisfy your Lao food cravings!  Trust me on this because I'm from Laos.  Hubby isn't Lao, but he loves Lao food.  So of course he tagged along when I went to check out this place. 

We went with the the staple for our maiden voyage - sticky rice, papaya salad, and beef jerky.  Sticky rice was cooked perfectly- not too sticky and not too mushy.  Papaya salad wasn't acidic enough for me.  I like it WAAAY acidic though.  Just a personal preference.  ""B"" (our waitress & cook) kindly fixed it for me.  Very much appreciated.  Beef Jerky was well seasoned. 

We went back for more of the staple on subsequent trips and have also tried nem khao, beef larb, sandwich, and sticky rice with bananas.  All good.  So many more things to try.  We will eventually make it through the menu.  

As others have mentioned & pictures show, this place is primarily a grocery store that happens to serve food.  There are a few tables & chairs in the middle of the store.  So if you are looking for an upscale place to dine or a certain ambiance to impress a date, this isn't it.  But, if you are looking for Lao comfort food in a no frills setting, this is for you. 

Hopefully, y'all will go check it out and keep them in business!"
Positive	"So the girls and I decided on MGM for EDC weekend even though we weren't actually going to the festival itself. MGM was also hosting the fight so it was a busy weekend! We arrived Friday night around 11 pm and valet was still open. I've stayed at other hotels on the strip with a late arrival and valet was closed. So kudos to you MGM.

Check in was pretty easy considering all that was going on. I think we waited a total of like 30 minutes roughly. Our bellhop was extremely nice and asked if we needed anything else after he brought our luggage to us. We actually only left the hotel itself once because we enjoyed it so much.

The hotel offers wifi, but don't get too excited the service was horrible whether I was on wifi or using my own data. Don't plan on sending too many text messages or using social media while there, lol.

We decided to eat by the pool. It was a nice view, but a little hot. The menu didn't have a wide selection of food. In my opinion it was pretty limited. I had just a burger and fries it was about $17. The burger was pretty good and the portion was large. 

We spent Saturday at the lazy river and that was tons of fun. A lot of people, but everyone was super friendly and there to have a good time. They have different drink options you can pretty much get anything you want in what I call a to go cup. They cost about $26 with your drink of choice and refills are $17. Also jello shots are $3 which is even better. 

Overall the hotel was nice. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was also nice. I would stay here again."
Positive	"Tasty food, great service, and they don't skimp on portions or flavor!

favorites are their carne asada, carnitas, fish tacos, and their horchata which is freshly made and not out of a bag or machine...you can actually taste the rice and bits of canela with every sip...

They are a ton more authentic than that other place that starts with an
L(indo......YUCK!!!)

Mondays are AYCE Taquizas(street style tacos)...Bet this place will be jumpin' during football season!

Try Leticia's out, you'll see what I'm talkin' about....ALOHA!!!"
Positive	I had the Mediterranean sandwich and added chicken to it on Multigrain bread. It was so tasty. I love how soft the bread is and that they toast it. Staff were friendly, but a bit slow in making the sandwich...so that's why I gave this review 4 stars. Women's bathroom was tidy and clean. All the tables were clean. Cheesy broccoli soup was just okay..kind of bland. Other than that, a nice healthier option for lunch.
Positive	"So I'm giving Thrifty's Ice Cream a five star!!! Man this place brings back memories from when I was a kid, and let me tell you- even today, nothing's changed. It's just as I remembered it-creamy, cold, and delicious ice cream! As a child I'd usually get a double scoop, bubble gum flavor and something else, most likely it was cookies and cream. They still have those flavors and they're just as good!! 

We went on Mother's Day last Sunday, May 14th. I guess everyone was feeling ice cream that day because the line was almost out the door. I couldn't believe how long the line was, but it moved rather quickly. 

They have so many flavors to pick from. I got a triple scoop that included butter pecan, strawberry, and mint chocolate chip on a waffle cone. Super delicious!! And it was huge!! They offer three options for cones. Sugar, waffle, and the traditional ice cream cones. You can even request they be chocolate dipped. Other items they provide are milkshakes, etc. Also, if you're not sure which flavor (s) to choose, they will gladly let you sample their selection. 

There were two employees working that day- a young man and lady. Both were fantastic at moving the line of customers along, while also  providing above average customer service. Great attitudes these two had, they didn't appear to be stressed or overwhelmed by the volume of customers, which is sometimes hard to do. 

So, outstanding employees, clean premises, and quality goodies means it couldn't get any better. Yelpers, go check them out. Bring your loved ones."
Positive	Never having Chinese noodle soup before, I wasn't really sure what to expect. We sat at the bar and watched a gentleman, on the other side of the glass, pull and twirl strands of uncooked noodles before our eyes. And I enjoyed every minute of it- dinner and a show? SCORE. THE SERVICE. The server was nice and knowledgeable and described each dish perfectly. There were no surprises for us when we got our food. And she did not lead us astray. They were also quick refilling our waters (it's the little things that count.) So onto what's even more important. THE FOOD. We ordered spicy wonton and I'm sensitive to spiciness but if you avoid the hot chili oil, it wasn't that bad. But if you like the spice than dipping and rolling it around in the hot oil would satisfy your taste buds. The wontons are smaller in size than what I'm used to and I ended up pouring a little soy sauce on them. The flavors were good and all, however, I probably wouldn't order that appetizer again. For our main course, we ordered Shang beef noodle soup with the thin hand pulled noodles (naturally, wanted to try what the noodle artist had been working so hard on making- but you have different options, the one we ordered is similar to spaghetti in shape/thickness but there's a flatter noodle choice as well.) Anyway, this soup is what I would come back for. The broth, texture of noodle and the braised beef brisket were YUM. The thought of its dark broth and bok choy are making my mouth water as I'm recollect and write this review. Honestly. You just have to try it for yourself.
Positive	This was another Yelp recommended stop. The food comes out quick in almost all Mexican restaurants but it took quite some time for us at this place. The dining room wasn't even full which was odd. Food was really good though so that made up for it.
Positive	I agree with my fellow Yelpers.  This is a fun little venue, and worth the $7.00 cover charge.  The singers might not actually have the best voices, but they are definitely talented entertainers.  I went early-ish (9PM) and there were no seats left.  However, the place really didn't start jumping either until about 10:30PM so...
Positive	A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied.
Positive	"After reading Jade W's reply about where else to look for Mashti Malone (Persian style) Ice Cream, I Yelped Zaytoon Mediterranean Market and Kabob, which another patient where I go for my PT sessions had also recommended last week.  So with the location programmed in my head, I drove to Zaytoon after my PT appointment for my late lunch.

The market is larger than I expected for an ethnic market located near Desert Breeze Park.  There are plenty of parking spaces in the strip mall where it is located, so buy as much as you want, because the walk to the car will be a short one.  The market has a decent size herbs & spices section, including Sumac, which I have recently heard about in my Mediterranean Cuisine class. They also carry fresh herbs in the refrigerator and they are in good condition and priced reasonably.  But I was mainly here to try the kabob and the Mashti Malone ice cream, which I didn't find on my own and had to ask about with the owner/cashier.

Anyway, my primary objective is to try their kabob and I ordered their Koobideh Kabob entree ($8.99), which is Persian marinated ground beef, grilled on a sword-like skewer, and served with grilled tomato and Basmati (long grain) rice, and some raw onions.  The portion was good, and the Koobideh was juicy and pretty tasty. I would give it a 4 stars on the food. And 5 stars if they also serve fresh bread (like the one at Flame Kabob) too.

Service was good, but I was also the only in the ""restaurant"" at around 3:20pm, and the older gentleman and later the son(?) both came out on separate occasion to ask how the food was and if everything was okay, plus give me suggestion about the traditional way of eating the Basmati rice (which is to mix it with some of the soften butter and sprinkle with some Sumac).  So 4.5 stars there.

I also asked about and was directed to their freezer right by the cashier and the door, where they keep all the Mashti Malone Persian Ice Creams.  I tried the Rosewater Saffron with Pistachios Ice Cream Sandwich last night, and wanted to try a different flavor today and went with the Creamy Rosewater Ice Cream ($2.99 for the smallest size container or 4 fl oz) so I can have it at the store.  I love the taste and fragrance of the rosewater, which is so different from the other more traditional ice cream flavors available everywhere else.

They also serve fresh squeezed juice at the juice bar, but I didn't see a menu for that.  Their ad states that they serve fresh juice (juiced per order) and have no additives, no added sugar and made from fresh not frozen ingredients.  Which makes this a hidden gem for juice lovers.

With Zaytoon being in my neighborhood, I will definitely be back for more ice cream, kabobs and sample their Juice Bar offerings.

P.S.  They also offer cater services and will deliver within a limited delivery area for a 10% delivery charge and on minimum order of $50."
Positive	"This location is visually seductive.

Their version of the vegetable spring rolls, hot & sour soup. Mandarin kung pao and fried Rice are successes, no question about it.

The Vegi rolls are bright, aromatic, spicy, sweet. An impressive cold appetizer.  

The hot & sour authentic soup is essentially an ancient doctor's curative healing magic combined with taste.

Mandarin kung pao a super familiar dish that delivers if you eat the peppers. And the fried rice, a basic godsend.

My expectations are met."
Positive	This is place is awesome, hands down great food and craft beer. not to mention a dog friendly restaurant for you animal lovers. Everyone is very helpful and passionate about their job. fantastic place for families and large parties.  If your a sports fan of any can this is the place  for you ,over 10 led's and great sound systems. A classy sports bar without a doubt.
Positive	I loved the service provided by the office. The front desk was very helpful and answered all my inquiries. Dr. Walker was very professional and I felt very comfortable and happy with the procedure. The office is very neat and nice. I highly recommend Endodontic Specialists.
Positive	"The sliced lamb is much better than other hotpot places -- much thinner and more fresh, a real northern china hot pot style.

The service is good. I got my items within 5 mins after I placed my orders.

Will definitely go back!"
Positive	"This place did an amazing job on my nails! I wanted the acrylic ombré full set and they did a beautiful job. 

The reason I rated 4 stars was because when I signed in I asked if there was time for my sister in law to get a pedicure and they said no. Not even 4 minutes later they had a walk-in for a pedicure and accepted it, then the person who was working on my nails said someone would finish them up soon and went and started on this persons pedicure. Take me confirm, this person DID NOT have an appointment, they asked we when she walked in. The other thing, I was quoted $60 (which is really pricey!) for my nails then when paying they charged me $65! I had to bring t up to get the correct amount charged and put that $5 towards the rest of her tip."
Positive	"Overview: Very clean, chair and table restaurant located a little far from the strip. A bit pricey (100$ for 3 people). Best for dinner with a small group. I would eat here again as well as recommend it to others that enjoy asian tapas. 

Ambiance: modern, medium lighting, played 90s alternative/pop music 

The best dishes I had: 
thai chile nam pla chicken wings - perfectly lightly fried wings with a very flavorful thai garlic fish-sauce glaze, good size wings

hamachi special - very tender hamachi sashimi in a light sweet ponzu-like sauce with a jalapeno slice and garnish on top (my favorite)

Dishes I did not like that I ordered were: 
vegetable tempura - not a fan of their vegetable selection; too oily and can get much better at a sushi restaurant; also eggplant does not taste good in tempura form

asparagus bacon kushi - plain, nothing special (you can make this at home)

shio ayu - very dry and plain (comes with a lemon and some blended daikon as garnish)

Other dishes:
age dashe tofu - beautiful presentation, good marinade. solid dish, like most other restaurants that offer the same dish

crab fried rice - very good fried rice. standard deliciousness

beef tongue kushi - very tough and no sauce. not a fan of beef tongue to begin with but they did a satisfactory job

shrimp kushi - (shell on shrimp with the head) miso butter makes it good and a little different

kara age chicken - tasty and juicy but typical asian fried chicken nuggets

half japanese street corn - very tasty corn covered in their special sauce. A must try if youre a corn lover. pretty presentation.

wagyu beef kushi - 3 pieces of steak, very tender and juicy

shishito pepper kushi - very tender squid, not tough at all (which what I was expecting). Comes with what tasted like a light sesame seed oil glaze"
Positive	"After reading a couple negative reviews, we decided to give this new restaurant in our neighborhood a fair chance to either earn a return visit or not.  We were delighted to eat on the patio around 8 p.m. on a Friday night, because the noise inside made conversation difficult.  Part of this problem was due to the crowd and an open kitchen with clattering dishes, but mostly it was due to the hard surfaces and lack of acoustical tiles. This might not be a problem for those with perfect hearing, but if one has challenges, eating outside eliminates any problem.  

We were greeted by the owner, Pon, who I recognized as having worked previously at Pho Chandler; she also recognized me, which was nice.  Another waitress came by our table frequently, making sure we had water right away and following up to make sure we were served in a timely manner.

We ordered the summer rolls, which came with a delicious peanut sauce, and Tom Ka Coconut Soup with chicken.  Sometimes chicken in this soup is tough, but this was tender and tasty.  The spice level was perfect--unless you accidentally chewed some of the root.  Most of the menu is Thai-inspired, but Mongolian Beef was more Chinese in influence, and it was tasty as well.

I was also happy to see the TV sets were not turned to F(o)aux News, as some other neighborhood restaurants are.  That kind of vitriol and fear-mongering has no place in a restaurant or other public place, imho.

Our bill was brought promptly on request, and I'm happy to enter a good review for the ""new kid in the neighborhood."""
Positive	"I honestly have no complaints about Vua aside from the fact that I spilt some of the delicious sauce on my pants as I was eating! 

Vua is a cheap but good quality banh mi place in downtown Montreal. They have quite an extensive menu but only one vegetarian option, so that's what I opted for (as usual for me). 

The base of the veggie banh mi was a tofu carrot mix which was prepared quite well and tasted very flavourful. After that came the toppings which were red onions, coriander, jalapeños and shredded carrot - all the toppings were super fresh! 

If you decide to dine in, Vua has a really clean interior, but it works awesome as takeout! What really made this banh mi so good was the sauce - it was a fish sauce of sorts and when mixed with the mayo...mmmmm just so good! It wasn't overly salty - it was just perfect. 

At the price point, you really can't go wrong with Vua."
Positive	"I originally reviewed this restaurant when it was under old ownership. I have been a couple of times since the new owners took over, and it gets better each time. They ask for input when you get your bill, and the menu has changed a bit since my  first visit under new ownership. 

The selections are great. I love the different wine flight options they have. I have only had a few things on the menu, but the bruchetta was amazing! They have updated the seating area and added a patio. The live music is always awesome, and really helps create a relaxing environment. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable. 

A few people mentioned high prices,  but I think it's on par with all the other wine bars I have visited. Plus, the food is better than most and the service is great. Love it!"
Positive	I've always wanted to try this place, as we drive past on our way to our daughters house. Husband was craving a BLT so I suggested we try it. Wow, so happy we came by. Hubby had the BLT. I had the Brussels sprouts, extra crispy and the Seared Foie Gras. (Dang was that delicious!!!!). And, they have homemade cinnamon ice cream. It's like the chef knows very thing I covet and love!
Positive	"I was pretty excited to try Beckett's and I have been back 4 times in 2 months so I consider myself a devoted fan. They did an excellent job of remodeling the old place (whose name we shall not mention). And no matter how busy they are I have never had a wait for a table. 


Here's the breakdown of what I have tried:

Grilled cheese with pancetta and roasted red pepper tomato soup - 3 stars

Rock shrimp, corn and butternut squash enchiladas in a guajillo sauce - 3 stars

Short ribs, mashed potatoes, green beans, red wine reduction - 4 star (when they say fork tender they mean it and the reduction is amazing)

Brussels sprouts, pancetta and manchego, in a lemon thyme vinaigrette - 5 Gazillion Stars, best I've had in a restaurant.

And to top it all off (Damn you Georgie S.)
chocolate dipped bacon s'mores - They come on a plate with  caramel, marshmallow creme,  peanut butter, and a graham cracker- 4 stars


The patio will be a nice place to hang out when the weather gets a bit warmer, and one day I may even go back and try a cocktail."
Positive	Great friendly knowledgable staff! Great selection of items and a great catalog to order from if they don't. Got a small quad with an fpv camera and made sure I left the store with it working and even helped me trim it. Other people came in while I was there with some issues and they jumped right to helping them figure out the problem. Definately coming back when I graduate to a bigger drone for video work.
Positive	"Best quality handcrafted ice cream ever in T.O. The huge lineup even in winters says it all. Good combination of the ""ice cream"" flavor vs. the actual ingredients, e.g. the strawberry flavor doesn't taste too sour like actual strawberries, but not fake enough like bad quality ice cream. But you know they use the real thing in there. (:"
Positive	The customer service is great! And it's pretty much the only up to standard Greek place out here. It's great if you're really craving a gyro which is sometimes the case for me, but it's definitely not the best. The pits is not a great texture and the tzatziki sauce is really bland and watery like most people say on here. It really compromises the whole meal in my opinion but it gets 4 stars because it actually has really good food.
Positive	Gud place ths, tho vry smal, i wud try 2 find a place anthr tym as wel..! nt jst milk, bt also passion nd interest ws poured in2 the cofe..! gues wat.. the flavor ws perfekt..! Wel, hw cud it b any les..?!
Positive	"A massively commercialized ""farm"" experience, but what the hell?  It's pretty damn fun.

You get to pick some apples, pet a goat, find a pumpkin, wander a corn maze, eat some AMAZING fresh hot apple donuts, grab some soybeans, or frolic amongst the squash--ALL AT ONCE.

I liked it.  It was cheesy and a bit cliche, and the people that were visiting were as much farmers as I (a Los Angeles transplant) am.  But that's alright.  I spotted everyone from a nun to a group of African international students to a Chicago businessman in the cafe eating those delicious donuts."
Positive	LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUDIO! The teachers are very welcoming and friendly, and the classes they offer are great. It definitely has a sense of community, but not the community where new people aren't welcome, but where new friends are encouraged, so don't be afraid to go by yourself. The studio is very clean and very although its an intense workout, the breathing and meditation that they teach you is very calming as well. I highly recommend this place.
Positive	"Amazing Customer Service and an Amazing Owner!! 

I found the Bike Shop with some word of mouth and the occasional drive by to and from home. I had always wondered what I'd find in the store and how I'd be treated walking in not knowing really much at all. 

On my first visit I was quickly greeted by Terry and asked what he could help me find. I explained I was looking for a low end road bike to get into and never once was I pushed into another direction. Terry was great at explaining all my questions and didn't make me feel out of place with not knowing much about cycling. 

I ended up leaving the shop that afternoon not making a purchase however with a great deal of knowledge given to me by Terry. The next day I returned with an extremely used Frankenstein bicycle that was thrown together from someone on Craigslist. I had decided to take an alternative with a smaller budget to get into my new hobby. 

Terry was at the store once again and he was again extremely helpful to me with my Cobbled bike of parts. What was also great is the fact I was remembered and called by name! Terry took great care of me with all questions and outfitting me with all the gear I asked about. I also appreciated the fact I wasn't being pushed into super high end items that I really wouldn't benefit from. I was extremely surprised when my bicycle was taken so they could install all the accessories I was going to purchase! This is something I would have never imagined and I planned on doing later that afternoon when I got home. During the installation of my peddles, the employee working on my bicycle noticed there was a part on my bike that seemed out of place. On a closer examination, it was clear I had an issue and this was shared with Terry. Terry and his employees once again blew me away with the customer service and the replacement of the part free of charge. 

The bottom line is, I've found an exceptional store with an owner that truly believes in great customer service and going above and beyond. I will be a life long customer and when I'm ready to make a purchase on my next bicycle, it will be at The Bike Shop!"
Positive	Sooooo good. The Skillets is where it's at if you ask me. Tony and the rest of the staff are great!  The food is off the hook.  Try it you won't regret it!
Positive	These tacos were the most authentique and delicious I've ever had. Oh man. They were crowded, and since my group was full, we ordered one taco each and one order of chips and the large guac. It was a lot of guac, so I was satisfied with that, first of all, and a ton of chips. The tortilla chips here were very fresh and unique: the thick cut and medley of seasonings gave a good spicy kick and not too much salt. I got the corn and bean taco which was SO tasty, and the portions were generous, so I had to (as did the rest of my group) get a fork to eat some filling before we deigned to pick them up and munch, and we also used forks to shovel up the fallen-out bits. So yummy. There isn't much seating available inside, and if you're planning on eating fresh, try to snag a bench outside along with a handful of wet wipes. Highly recommend!!!
Positive	Great atmosphere. Quite chill. Heard an awesome band there when I went. They're definitely not stingy with the amount of alcohol they put in their mixed drinks and the bartenders are very friendly. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for a good laid back night.
Positive	Sadly, Indian Home Cooking aka Curry Kitchen is closed: the entire block of Dundas/Church SE is being demolished for condos. But all is not lost for fans of their wonderful $5 chicken biryani. Their phone # here redirects to this place https://www.yelp.ca/biz/falafel-house-toronto Falafel House at 760 Yonge St. s of Bloor (there was also briefly a hand-printed sign up redirecting here before it was boarded over) which may have a different name and employees, but still honored my $5-including-tax chicken biryani when I told them I was a Curry Kitchen customer. The biryani was almost as good and you can't beat the price. Hope this helps Curry Kitchen's former customers.
Positive	"One of my fave t-shirts reads ""Spooning Leads to Forking."" That said, all I can say, is that whatever leads me back to the Roaring Fork is OK with me. A sprawling, rustic space with antler chandeliors (pahleeze, I can't spell that) and a roaring fireplace serving up fantastic New American fare. A perfect spot for a post movie double date. Let's start off in reverse by reviewing the desserts....The banana split, with fried bananas would make even a monkey cry with ecstacy. We were fighting for the last bite. Entrees of roasted duck with sour cherry sauce and sauteed cabbages was delectible. I ate, seriously, every bite. Rickie's fried chicken was juicy and crisp. The seared Ahi tuna with fresh avocado was perfectly prepared. Appetizer fish tacos were fresh, clean and light. All pre dinner salads were crisp and tossed in fantastic dressings. My field green salad, however, was short on beets and the fried goat cheese a bit gummy and luke warm. Service was polite, friendly, although I would enjoy a little more spark and verve from the staff. She seemed like she was sleep walking. Wine list was extensive. Crowd was very family like this evening, with lots of holiday revelery and gift exchange. Great spirited vibe all around. Can't wait to go back. Perhaps I'll wear my t-shirt. Perhaps the server will wake up."
Positive	A pretty amazing experience. We ordered the oysters, the chefs combo for 50 bucks and a yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. We left here satisfied and happy. Cant wait to come back for another round.
Positive	Amazing frozen custard. I love and always have the Hawaiian delight. The Chicago dog is always so good, and their hamburger is very delicious and flavorful. Love this place. The service was fast also.
Positive	"I signed up with Wave after 3 months with another service. The difference was significant - for the better. The two woman who showed up were very thorough and professional. 
I currently have Jamie come weekly and she has done a tremendous job!
Greg"
Positive	"This theater is on the nicer end of the spectrum, and it's in a pretty quiet strip mall, so parking is usually not a problem.  Lots of screens gives you lots of options and times.  One of the things I don't like about this place is the lack of stand-out eating, drinking, and coffee options in the immediate vicinity.  Go for the movie and head west to City North and Desert Ridge area, or south to Kierland (not that there are any great places to eat in any of these malls, but at least you have flexibility).  

I don't know that I've ever seen a movie in this particular CineCapri.  What it is is a single screen that's basically much larger than the rest (I have been to the newer location at Tempe Marketplace).  This location also has a number of normal-sized screens (which I have experienced, hence this review) to offer you additional options."
Positive	Steve is the best Realtor anyone could ask for. He helped us sell our house and helped us find our new home all at the same time!   He listens to what you are actually looking for and shows you the properties that will fit what you are looking for.  He is very honest and thinks outside the box to find the best properties.  Steve kept us up to date with everything that was going on with both our house and finding the new one.  He would answer all our questions and explained everything easily.   If you are looking for a great Realtor Steve is your guy!!!!!!!!
Positive	"I will never buy my meat anywhere else around Cleveland! Their chicken breast came out of the package perfectly trimmed. And I can feel confident that I'm getting quality meat. Their chicken is free range and not fed antibiotics. I also purchased some 80% lean ground chuck and bulk sweet Italian sausage to make one of the best lasagnas I've ever made! The beer selection is smaller but perfectly hand selected, I picked up a 4 pack of Disco Godfather from Platform. And while my budget didn't allow for it, I'd did walk past and drool over their amazing cheese case! 

For special dinners, this will always be where I pick up my proteins. And if I'm looking to impress the boyfriends family, this is where I'll be stocking up on supplies for an incredible charcuterie!"
Positive	Best place to get your nails done in valley....the owners are very professional and great at what he does..he will be the only one who touches my nails..gone twice and have not been disappointed yet!! Thank u Andy
Positive	"Just wanted to drop a note about how great my service was.

Check engine light came on and the code thrown said I had a small leak in my fuel lines. It always seems near smog check month the damn CEL comes on right?

Anyway, he offers to smoke test the car for $80 and I tell them to go for it. During the hour it took for the test he always came in to update me on the status and it was greatly appreciated. It turns out they couldn't find anything wrong with my car, the cleared the light/code for me and told me to come back if it comes on again.

I offered to pay the $80 for the smoke test and he declined. I was pleasantly surprised that they did not try to rip me off. If my usual guy is closed, this will definitely be my next stop!"
Positive	I got a lot of help and was shown many options for a rental property I was seeking. They showed me several options that I was happy with and I am now happily placed in my new condo. Thanks so much for the help and services!
Positive	"12/23/15

3.5 stars! 

It was very busy at Rise Up Bakery this morning!  I arrived sometime between 9 and 10 am, and as expected, RUB was humming.  Not with customers (I was the only one there), but with one cashier, who was busy bagging pick-up orders and icing cinnamon rolls as they finished cooling off on the baker's racks, and three bakers, including an apprentice, flouring the table (or scraping them clean) in preparation to knead more dough for foccacia,  baguettes, bread loaves, cake breads, cinnamon rolls, babkas, cookies, and bars- oh, my!  I assumed that people would be in and out to pick up their holiday orders, and sure enough, many did show up to pick up tomato and pesto focaccia, pumpkin and chocolate chip breads, and sour dough breads, among other items.

I came in to buy Peach & blueberry loaf, and I left with TWO said loaves (can't remember how much each), a French baguette ($3), a pumpkin and chocolate chip bread ($6), two sliced breads (honey wheat and white, with the white fresh-sliced right before bagging!), an oatmeal-raisin cookie ($1.50, or $1.75?), and two scones (a raspberry and a blueberry; $2 each, I think).  The scones were surprisingly NOT dry, were sweet and buttery (and did not need extra butter or curd spreads to enjoy), and despite having a powdery, crumbly texture, was not off-putting, like most dry scones I've tried in the past.  If I were to try to improve** on these scones, I would ADD more FRUIT, but that's just me being too mindful of all the butter that I know goes into scone recipes!  I figure if there's more fruit in the batter, then that must mean there's less butter in the recipe!  Hehe!  I know- silly me!

It was nice to see that even though the bakers were busy baking, and the cashier (a second arrived 20 minutes, or so after I arrived) was busy filling catering orders while making sure the store was amply-stocked for walk-ins, that said cashier was not too busy to make customers feel not-rushed in their selections.  We guests AND cashier traded stories on favorite local haunts, favorite bakery items, and one customer even described how she presented the tomato-pesto bread to her house guests- hot tomato soup and said bread for dinner, and everyone taking a loaf home after as a gift from their host!  The cashier then added that she liked to warm the pesto bread and then add tuna on top.

Rise Up Bakery supplies four bread loaves to Whole Foods (white, wheat, cinnamon-apple, and the fourth may be dill-rye?), which sell at $7 each.  Buy them here, as well as other selections, at just $4.50 a loaf!  Don't forget to use the loyalty cards for sliced loaf purchases-- buy ten SLICED loaves and get the next one free!

I asked if RUB supplies local restaurants with their breads and was told yes, but I could not clearly hear the name she mentioned.  I will edit this review once I find out for sure!

Merry Christmas Eve, everyone!

**Dear Rise Up Bakery... Please, pretty please, offer organic selections!"
Positive	"Awesome dim sum during lunch hour!
This is a place that many people can just pass by, but my husband and I had some time to kill during lunch hour, and decided to have some quick dim sum.
This place exceeded my expectations! So good"
Positive	I am from NJ And this was amazing! Everything we got we loved :) recommended food: smashed avocado Benny, rancheros and OMG! French toast was to die for!!! Amazing environment as well, the waitress was really nice and accommodating to many needs. Definitely would come back next time I am in Phoenix!
Positive	Food here is really good.  It's a hipster type joint with good coffee and good breakfast items.  I'm here from out of town and it provides a good breakfast!
Positive	The atmosphere is clean and they are super nice. Natalie was awesome. I really in love with my nails. I'm the type I feel like they deserve a good rating I'll write cause they are awesome. This is first time I did gel nail color with short nails and Nat made it look beautiful to my standards. I will definitely be back.
Positive	"My husband and I stopped by to a quick snack and it was a pleasant surprise. 
The savoury pies are absolutely amazing!
Prices seems a bit high but it's definitely worth it. We had the Guinness and the Southern Pulled Pork. The filling was moist and flavoured and quite a generous portion.
We are definitely coming back to try some other flavours!"
Positive	I have received nothing but the best service from every individual that I interacted with.  From Jessica the receptionist, to Mindy the Property Manager assistant, to Dee the Leasing Agent to Michelle.  ALL so helpful and wonderful people.  It was so refreshing to have had such a great experience with them after I received a bad experience at a previous property management firm.  The process was smooth and simple and they were able to accommodate my immediate move in.  I definitely would recommend this company to anyone who plans on moving to Las Vegas!!
Positive	"Not sure why customers are providing a negative review of this place. We picked up our rental car and found the interior to be dirty, and a piece of interior front passenger side carpeting was torn. Since we discovered this condition before driving away, we went back to the service counter to complain.  The customer service representative understood and offered us an upgrade.  The replacement car was clean.  The employees were courteous to us.

The check in process was easy. Budget is located within the new rental car center."
Positive	Where do I start? We flew in from California and haven't ate all day! It was already 4pm by the time we got to our suite. I was starving and this was the number one buffet I wanted to try. I had read many great things upon coming to try this buffet. Although it like $52 it was SO worth it. The food was just outstanding. The selection was pretty big. I have tried another buffets in Vegas in the past and to me this place topped them all. I will definitely come back!
Positive	I had my two dogs groomed there, they were great. I normally take them to pet smart but could not get in so used these people instead as I said, they were great. About $10 more per dog but experience groomer not the type you get it Petsmart Woodruff freshly out of school
Positive	I have a number of childhood memories of coming here with our school.  I'm a little sad that they shut down the general store and moved the candy to a gift shop but the space is an important reflection of our history.  They've done an exceptional job of maintaining the buildings and have a lot of seasonal activities geared for kids.  They could be planned out a bit better (their chestnut roasting had about 50 chestnuts for countless hundreds of people) but when you realize how driven it is by volunteers, these are not big issues.  Very glad it is there.
Positive	"I definitely recommend Dr. Vipul Kubal! He is the kind of doctor you want taking care of you! He listens and oh so very nice!

He, and his staff, Sonja, Stephanie, and Ana are friendly and compassionate! My dream team!

Thank you for all your help! If only I can give more than 5 stars, I will give you...infinity!"
Positive	"Oh Anthro.  

I hate your oh-so-awesome shabby-chic appeal: from adorable kitchen wares, to hand-knit bedding, to amazing dresses, to that addicting Voluspa collection, to gold jewelry accessories, to blouses I can't afford, to house-decor that's too cute to pass up.

I hate you b/c I wish I could have you replicated @ home.

WOA:
* This is a nice & large location of Anthro, on 2nd floor of Forum Shops.
* Friendly service"
Positive	"After looking at so many places to celebrate a birthday, decided on Alize. Chose this restaurant because I really liked the special touch they add with the key that opens a surprise. Plus, tasting menu was much friendlier on the wallet compared to others. Made a reservation for 2 at 6pm on a Friday. Customer service was wonderful and Nikki was more than helpful and splendid. 

Arrived a little early and was seated right away. The view is spectacular whether you get a window table or not. Service is impeccable! Staff is more than attentive and makes you feel special. They are so accommodating and answer any questions.

Both ordered the tasting menu with caviar addition. The entire experience...was more than amazing!!! Tasting menu consists of 7 or so courses and you select one item in each course. You select everything at the beginning and also get an option for tea or coffee to enjoy with little cookie nibbles before dessert comes out. 

Food was wonderful! Caviar, foie Gras, fresh shaved truffle, amuse bouche, duck, lamb, cheese, bread, etc etc etc. Even the coffee was bad ass and the way they make coffee table side was neat. 

The only item that we both did not like....was the masa crusted chicken. Duck is far superior in that course selection. 

Overall, birthday dinner was a success and everything was just so special. You definitely leave full!"
Positive	"The sow was such a wonderful experience,  poor Sean who has to put up with me on my 30 days no pasta, rice or bread lifestyle. Haha. Anddddd top it off I am a vegetarian. Anywho, this place reminds me of the deuce and yardhouse combine. I love it, and an open kitchen. It's great.

I started off with the eggplant frits as an appetizer. Holyyy moly of spongebobbbb. The taste was wonderful,  lightly breaded (cheat day) eggplant dipping it with marinara sauce and a mox with cholula hot sauce.. two thumbs up.

My entrée was the vegetable board minus the beets, and he substituted it with fried tomatoes.  I didn't like that so much. The kale salad was on par and I asked for an extras. Everything else was wonderful. 

Ill be coming back :)"
Positive	Went to the grand opening today with my parents. Small little, quaint place on busy McDowell where we were greeted promptly and told to sit since we were eating there. My parents and I all ordered 3 tacos each (Carne Asada, Al Pastor & Cabeza). The tacos were pretty fulfilling along with the salsa and what I believe was an avocado cream sauce. The only small issue I had was the lack of salt, my tacos were a touch bland but that's an easy fix. Will come back soon to try the other items.
Positive	"So I live about 5 minutes from this place which makes it very convenient to come here... plus its open pretty late! They are open till 9pm on most days which is awesome cause I can do what I need to do during the day and run errands then afterwards rewind at the nail salon before heading home. 

So lets talk about how the place looks.. seems cozy.. its kinda small compared to others Ive been to which can be a good thing cause it can be more personable here. There is 6 pedi chairs here I believe.. and many manicure tables. The decor is pretty basic from what i remember... nothing fancy here.  Price point is very similar to everywhere else in the area. What i wish they offer here is some drinks! lol maybe some hot tea.. ice tea.. bottle water.. sodas.. or maybe even some alcoholic beverages like others Ive been to :P 

So what I love about coming here is the pedicures I get from DON.. he's so sweet and does a very meticulous job on making sure your feet is smooth/soft! He is very personable and I enjoy having conversations with him. He doesn't rush doing your pedicures like some other nail techs. He takes his time plus he makes sure your feet feels like heaven! 

Okay so I normally get a dip powder sns french tip nails.. which is much healthier for your nails compared to acrylic. Ive been here a couple of times to get this done but the last time I went there I went to AMY she's the owner here. She is very personable and sweet. She seems to care about her customers experience here whether she is doing the work or someone else is doing it. She makes sure you get a good job on the work as well as you being comfortable. She is very high energy and vocal... you can definitely see she runs things around here. So lets talk about how my nails look.. she did a great job on it as far as how the tips look and how the shape of the nails look. 

Overall I do enjoy my experience here and would come back again. The location as well as the late hours makes it a place I want to be back at. From my experience you can have different experiences at the same location depending on who you get to do your nails. So pick wisely and book an appointment!! You can't go wrong with Amy or Don! They are amazing nail techs!"
Positive	Came to Grotto for a late night snack after losing a Bag o' Chips on Roulette.  Turns out that the resaraunt side was closed, but the bar was open and was only serving pizza.... perfect!  The pizza was baked on the spot and took no less than 10min.  We ordered a thin crust margherita, and well.. it got me shakin' my marakas!  The pizza hit the spot and paired perfectly with an ice cold beer.  Don't have much else to say about Grotto except the known fact that the pizza is definitely not Grott-esque!  Har har har..
Positive	"Check into the Cosmopolitan and was starving.. Of course I yelp what is near by and this gem came up. Gordon Ramsey Brugr is tucked away at the Planet Hollywood past the casino floor. We were seated right away and served by a very nice young man named Jay.. He recommended 2 cocktails. Their cocktail menu is interactive on an IPad. They offer is the food menu as a souvenir which was cool. So to the food:

Beer batter onion wrings : A - 

Truffled parm fries: B-

Farm burger: A ( 2nd best burger i have have in my life. ( medium burger, duck bacon, English cheddar, fried egg... 


My cocktail of choice was the whisky cherry lemonade A! 

good job Yelp!"
Positive	We where a bit nervous about staying in this hotel due to its horrible reviews. But due to the amazing price and location we just said ehh we will deal and booked it. We ended up getting the luv tub suite. I must admit it was amazing. It had a king size comfy bed, a large tub right next to the bed, and a 50in tv... What more can you ask for. Our room was clean no complains on room here. I dont know if other rooms are horrible but the suite was amazing. I would deff suggest booking this room for a couple bucks more. I didnt give 5 stars because the hotel itself is under construction so its a bit crazy. Also the rugs in the halls are really old but who cares are you sleeping in the hallway? No! Another negative thing was the elevators, there was only 4 of them for all the floors so you have to wait a long time sometimes. Also the check in is a bit of a wait since they don't have a lot of staff but the staff was nice and helpful. My point is... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! The price is amazing even tho there are some negative things if you want a super nice room that you will stay in all day book somewhere else. I mean who really stays in their room in vegas other than to sleep in. PRICE is great and LOCATION is AMAZING you are in the middle of everything! I would deff book here again in the future and hope I have the same amazing experience as the one we just had!
Positive	I continue to be hooked on this joint!  In addition to all the items I've eaten that are posted in my review of 4/1/15; I've now tried the chicken parm, the eggplant parm, baked ziti, and the sausage dinner plate; in fact, I had that again today - huge plate of sausage, peppers, and onions, smothered in cheese, baked in the pizza oven; covers the entire dinner plate; served with a large salad and a loaf (no misprint) of bread; easily feeds two, or plenty to take home - for $8.95!
Positive	Great customer service by finance team. Greg Hovis was an excellent person to work with - fast - concise and knowledgable. They got me out the door quick and all paperwork was accurate. He did a great job finding me a car I liked as well as something within my budget. Got the Q50 Hybrid and love it. All the bells and whistles. Thanks Greg.
Positive	Such a good place to eat. The baked ziti was so large I had to take half home. It was very creamy as well and they didn't skimp on the cheese!  My son had spaghetti and meatballs and love it as well. My husband had grilled chicken Caesar salad and ate the whole thing- it was huge!
Positive	Amber is an amazing stylist. She does a wonderful  job on my cut and color each time. I will forever be loyal to Her! All new clients should request Amber because she is professional and a perfectionist. She truly listens to what her client wants. Only negative is that the front desk girl is usually not so nice and doesn't seem personable or genuine whenever she speaks to you. She also refuses to say my name correctly.
Positive	Mmmmm mmmm! A little pricier than most in the area but well worth it. Fresh ingredients authentic cheese. Fantastic salads. Delicious calzones. Absolute best pizza in Lake county. When we want pizza this is where we go.
Positive	I come here all the time because I live next door. The employees are super friendly. Sometimes creepy friendly. They always have someone watching to see what check out lane is shortest for you. Today they double charged me accidentally and immediately charged it back to my card. Great neighborhood place to shop. :)
Positive	"Favourite sushi place in Calgary! I also love the millrise location but we go to this one more often because of the sushi bar.
The pocky guy is great!
The sushi is out  of this world. Amazeballs! All of it! Minori roll is my favourite. 
 The millrise location is definitely more kid friendly and we only go to that one with our little one."
Positive	After our Little Man Kylie passed away, we took in another Umbrella Cockatoo, Jesse. Jesse is a 30 year old Cockatoo and was for breeding purposes only. We can not pick him up and cuddle him but he does allow us to pet him and he gives adorable kisses. He's had his band around his claw for all these years and decided it was time to remove it. We had a hard time getting him into the dog carrier for the trip and expected Jesse to fight all of us while at the vet. Our Jesse did just the opposite - he was such a good Little Gentleman. He was given a check up and they removed the ring without any trouble. I believe Jesse even enjoyed himself. Thank you to all that helped.
Positive	By far the best burger throughout PHOENIX!  This place is the best place for burgers and family!  The fries are amazing and the quality of ingredients is superb!  Fun environment and worth the wait in line!  We found our place when we are craving for a great burger!  They have hatch chile as well which makes it even better!!  + out of  !! Waitress --- Miss Amber was amazing - prompt and really provided great customer service!  Thanks Amber!  Oh, and she's related to Linda Carter somehow so that's cool!
Positive	Super friendly and helpful staff. Was our first time there and it was so so good!!! The medium poke bowl was more than enough! All the food was fresh and the complimentary teas were tasty!! We will be back!!
Positive	We have used K9 Convenience for the past year for our big goofball dog.  They are the best!  The owner is very responsive and the regular walkers (we have had two) are FANTASTIC!  They really interact with him the whole time, getting him to play and giving him love.  We get an email update every single day while we are at work, almost always with a cute photo of our pup.  We've used them for daily walks while at work and also for frequent visits while we are out of town so we don't have to board him, and they have been on time for every.single.visit!  Can't say enough good things about these folks.  The peace of mind is priceless.
Positive	Hands down best tacos I've ever had. I will drive way out of my way to come get these tacos! There is always a long line, which is a good sign! There is typically a 20-30 minute wait, but they are so worth it! I would give 10 stars if I could!
Positive	"This place is bomb! 

At first glance, the place may seem a bit sketchy. This is a food truck parked on the side of V&K Asian Market. The parking lot fits a max of 7 cars at a time but with creative parking, It fills up with 20+ cars, no exaggeration. Between the store customers and food truck customers, it's rare to find the lot empty. Be patient, smile at those creative drivers and suck It up cause the food here is worth It. 

I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume (based on the logo on the side of the truck) this place is run by 3 guys who are either friends or related. Nothing better than supporting locally owned joints around the hood. Just a few guys making an honest living and dishing out real AUTHENTIC TRADITIONAL Lao food. No shortcuts here, no fusion, just straight up the kind of food I grew up eating from my Lao friends' homes. 

What do i love about this place, you ask? 
Here, let me count the reasons. 
1. Sticky rice. Good old steamed sticky rice that's been soaked overnight for maximum softness but still glutinous and sticky enough to grab the food. 
2. Jeow Bong. A paste like sauce made with roasted Thai bird chili and seasonings ground by hand in a mortar and pestle. 
3. Larb. Moist chunks of chicken and it's skin marinated in lime juice, toasted rice powder and other seasonings, topped with a variety of fresh chopped herbs. Or chopped beef with tripe in the same sauce - but the beef is cooked perfectly, maintaining a tender medium rare taste. Both served room temperature and usually only made at special gatherings. 
4. Papaya salad, aka Thum Mahong. They're not modifying It for the tender of tastebuds. This salad has chunks of tamarind flesh and real homemade padek which is a type of fish sauce that may assault your nostrils but the umami of It just cant be substituted. If you've ever had Thai papaya salad, you haven't tasted the full umami flavor yet. 
5. Lao sausage. Fatty chunks of pork mixed with all the perfect seasonings, a little bit of pork skin for texture and rice to give It a slightly sour taste - trust me, it's all good. 

There are plenty of Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area and a few Lao stores that serve a few dishes but aside from the few gatherings I'm invited to and the annual Cambodian and Lao New Year celebrations at the temple, I don't have access to this type of food. This food truck has changed the Lao food scene. Go get yourself some!"
Positive	I love this Whole Foods Market! The people that work here are so knowledgeable & always willing to help. I came across at least two employees today who immediately greeted me & asked if I needed assistance with anything. When I did ask for a certain product, they not only showed me where it was--they also provided information about the product itself. I am blown away by the customer service here & will continue to shop here for all my food needs. Thank you, Whole Foods Market!!
Positive	"OMG I'm a fan! The dessert bar is AMAZING! =)

Some people aren't too crazy about the separate/small plates, but I love it. I'm not one to mix my sauces when I eat food so it works for me. I think it's what makes the place stand out from other buffets.

We went during lunch around 2PM on Sunday. There was a little bit of a line, but moved pretty fast since the staff ask how many are in your party before you even pay. I paid $50 including tax for 2 people. Not bad for vegas buffet of good quality. It would be 30 something per person if you wanted unlimited mimosas/blood marys with your meal.

Service was attentive and quick. Water pitchers provided for each table. Glasses always kept half full. Tables always cleared when coming back with more food.

Food had a good variety. There was a nice spread of salads/breads, breakfast, pasta/pizza, shrimp cocktails, prime rib/meat station, omelet station, asian section. They might have as many choices but most of what I ate was tasty. My favoriate was the eggs benedict!"
Positive	Fantastic breakfast establishment.  Super friendly staff and nice assortment of entrees.  Clean and pleasant dining with low prices.  Only complaint I have would be the portions.  Breakfast burrito was great but it's toddler material.  Not all bad, wasn't placed in a food coma for the day as I was hoping for (half kidding).  Will return most definitely.
Positive	"I started going here last year on the recommendation of a friend. I was referred to Amy, so that is who I have seen all but one time when Amy was on vacation, so I saw Tina. I was very uncomfortable and nervous at first as I knew nothing about acrylic nails. Never-the-less, my husband had convinced me to do this one extravagant thing for myself. And I have to admit, I love having the fancy nails! I would say Amy has probably done my nails a dozen times by now. She is warm and friendly and remembers me on each visit. She knows I like ""fancy, sparkly nails"" and is so creative and always has new designs for me to choose from. The place is frequently busy when I have been in and yet, I never feel Amy rushes. The spa itself is beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I would describe Tina ""highly energetic"" and she made me laugh. A lot. I loved the nails she did for me, as well. The gentleman at the front desk sat and chatted with me my last visit as I had to wait a few minutes. Everyone I have dealt with have been professional and friendly. I have only been to one other nail place, so I am no expert. However, I know that all my experiences here have been positive. I talk to other people that go to other salons and complain that their nails fall off. I have never had a single problem. I have added some pictures of my nails."
Positive	I ordered flowers for a birthday., and it was a positive experience. The delivery arrived on the time requested, the flowers looked great, and even after a week the flowers looked beautiful.This place is always awesome ... amazingly healthy flowers and always friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Positive	Was craving some wings while watching the Jays win the AL East Division and found this place through Yelp. The pictures we saw on Yelp did not do this place justice.  The wings are HUGE (just a lil chewy)!!! Dishes are good size portions and the prices were decent.  One of the best things about this place is that every booth has their own t.v. so you can watch whatever you want (just ask the server). The staff is friendly which is an added bonus.
Positive	"Had an interesting experience at scarpettas last night. After doing a lot of research on the Internet, we made reservations there for our 21st anniversary. When we arrived we were told their kitchen was closed due to a ""mishap"" but we could order from an alternate menu. We were a little confused but decided to go ahead since we were all dressed up and ready to eat. Once we were seated and looking at the menu, we realized that they were serving food from their sister restaurant next door. We were very disappointed since we've read so many good things about their food on yelp.     Then they brought out a complimentary appetizer which was very good. Had the meal and then they brought us 2 delicious desserts, one had ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate on the plate. Very nice. Then the big surprise came when the waiter informed us that the meal was on the house!!!  Totally unexpected! maybe the waiter sensed our dissappointment earlier in the evening, but we hadn't complained at all. 

So... I can't give an honest review of their food. However, the fact that they gave us our meal free says A LOT about how they feel about their customers. Very classy.  They made things right in a big way. 

As for ambience... Very classy, dark, contemporary and cool. They sat us by the window with a nice view of the bellagio fountains. 

Again, can't tell u about scarpettas food, but how can I not give them 5 stars when they treated my wife and I so well."
Positive	It's worth to go this sushi restaurant. We used to go to 168, but found its a bit too small and noisy. This place is huge and food is tasty as well.
Positive	"My name is Dan Kirksey, I am a highly successful real estate agent and I owe it all to Mike. Thank You Mike.

If you want to be a millionaire Realtor CONTACT MIKE AND DO EXACTLY WHAT HE TELLS YOU TO DO!"
Positive	Can't thank you enough Korrey!  Awesome service, quick and friendly! Highly recommend Korrey for any tint job you need.   I went with high grade ceramic after his heat lamp demonstration. Very competitive pricing and the convenience of mobile tinting can't be beat!
Positive	My decision to give this place a second try was an excellent one. After having a recent experience with  the brilliant array of restaurants in California that can accommodate both dietary restrictions AND the desire to eat well, my gratitude for Tree Huggers is so much greater. They are one of the only places on the West-West side of Cleveland that can boast many vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. Thankful for this place forging the way for healthy and tasty food to be established in this area!
Positive	"There is so many mexican restaurants in town. But, this is far and above one of the better ones. This is not cheap rice and beans and melted cheese every where!

They take great fresh meats and ingredients and make a wonderful product. The pulled pork here is to die for. I have eaten here several times and it keeps getting better. 

The service is top notch. 

HINT: They have one of the best happy hours in town!"
Positive	"I remember coming to La Santisima before and I remember liking it, but for some reason I never came back. On a late Saturday night, we wanted tacos and started to head over and got lost a little. It's because there is no obvious sign that lights up! Luckily, we have GPS on our phones - thank god for technology! It was so dark and sketchy around these parts...

We walk in and we are greeted with this cute restaurant with surprisingly, lots of people. We don't see a host. So we walk up to the bar and have a seat. We don't even get greeted until minutes later! We then get complimentary chips and we head to the salsa bar - oh, I love that salsa bar! It's awesome! I can eat chips and salsa all day if I could.

We finally order - I get the carne asada and chicken mole street tacos. Fiance gets the al pastor burro. The food takes forever to get to us! We finish our chips, we drank three cups of water, we watch the couple next to us get their food, eat, pay, and leave before we even get our food - that's how long it took!

I was getting antsy - but we finally get our food! The carne asada steet taco was good, but the chicken mole was freaken phenomenal!!!! Oh Mylanta - Mole Heaven! I insisted on trying the mole to my husband-to-be and he said it was amazing too!

I tried his al pastor burro and wasn't a fan - I'm not a fan of burritos that have lettuce in them. That's just me - but he loved it.

I give the food 5+ stars - the service is probably at a 1.5. However, I know I'll be back - the food is just too damn good."
Positive	"Love this place!  With more advertising during Spring training, this place could be an AZ Murphy's.

Go there before a 1pm game and have their great b-fast then take the free shuttle to and back from the game!"
Positive	Croissants made daily which is a unique experience around here. My favorite is the chocolate bavarian and the cinnamon. Unfortunately i have never been here for lunch. Their coffee is also very good, and customer service is welcoming.
Positive	Seriously? The person that runs this place is genius. I must find a way to copy your entire idea and move it to a beach for myself. I thought I walked into my own dream when I came in here. I haven't been to Lux in about 1.5 years and since then it has moved into the building next to the old one, tripled in size and is the most delicious, eclectic coffee experience I could ask for. Looking for fresh hand roasted coffee on site, check! Fresh made unique pastries, check! Fresh, gourmet-like food, check! Handmade from fresh (and I mean FRESH squeezed juice) mimosas, check! I can go on....I could not ask for a better place to be a part of my life. Thank you heaven for waiting for me to find you.
Positive	"I tried to eat ice cream and was here to visit.

It was also popular.
I ate cappuccino ice cream, and it was unbelievably tasty.

The staff were very good and good.

We took pictures with the polar bear model dolls beside getting the ice cream from there, and I recommend this place"
Positive	"Came here on weekday afternoon with my family on two separate occasions. On my first visit I had the Redneck burger and fries, and on the second I had a pulled pork sandwich with fried mac and cheese and onion rings. Both of my orders were fantastic and flavourful. The burger patties are nice and juicy, and the portions are really big. 
My mom also does not eat beef and had the quinoa burger and really enjoyed it.
The store is a bit small, but it's nice and clean. They also serve really delicious ice cream there as well. I would definitely recommend the Redneck burger and fried mac and cheese to everyone.
All in all, No Bull is really worth the money, and y'all should go check it out if you're looking for a good burger."
Positive	the first time i went to tryst was last year and the music was not good. there was not one hip hop song or any good music. i went last month again but had a great time. i always liked the decor and the fact it had on outdoor waterfall but this time the music was great. they played a lot of hits that was mixed but they actually played hip hop and a lot of lil wayne.i recommend this place. but plan on waiting in a crowd to get in unless you know someone, thankfully my brother put a call in for me and my girlfriends...and ryan craig (sr vip services manager) is a cutie. =D  i'll continue to come back as long as the music is good and they continue to play hits...
Positive	"My McDonald's of Chinese cuisine.

Quick,  plentiful and at a good price. 

Not much to complain about so long as you are going in knowing it's the McD and not the Keg.

Staple places when craving some quick congee and noodles..."
Positive	"Don't listen to these repressed, frigid whiners below. It's up to YOU to ring your own bell and no piece of latex can do it for you if you just ain't got it, but, if you got it and you want to ADD to it with a toy, video or article of trashy lingerie the Castle's got it.

Friendly, helpful staff too!"
Positive	Amazing restaurant! Been going to this location for over a year and highly recommend it :) No matter how many times I try other places, I always come back to my BEI (get it?). I would suggest the dragon roll. I get it every time!
Positive	It's a department store... how do you critique something like that?! It's clean, the parking lot is a disaster, the staff are usual for a department store. What I like is it is close to my home, is a full grocery store, offers healthy selections and their Archer Farms brand is worth checking out.
Positive	"Dearest Lunch Box, 

It's no secret I have a little crush on you. How could I not? You had me at hello with the vintage lunch boxes on the wall and the local art giving off that hip, urban vibe. 

I went with the Chicago dog which completely rocked! It came on a warm, soft poppy seed bun that gave me that nostalgic feeling of being a little girl and eating hot dogs at the baseball field with my dad. Now it wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was enjoyable and I inhaled it. 

The real star of the show was the homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. I have been passing around the pictures of this like an ice cream pusher. Here kid want an ice cream crack sandwich? Hell to the yeah!!! 

All this grubbing to the beat of the Gorillaz. You are a smooth dog Lunch Box and I will definitely fit you in to my cheat day rotation.

Positive	Adam took the time on a weekend to go over all my options of purchasing a new home with me.  He explained to me in great detail what I needed to do and made me feel like a friend, not a client.  I am excited to work with Adam and his team and would refer all my family and friends to him. The boles team has been available to me whenever I needed to ask questions which is very rare these days.
Positive	Have had chairs in the bar I work at recovered here.  Also had my dining room chairs at home done.  Turned out so great it's like having a new dining room set! Great customer service & pricing
Positive	"Our normal barber shop was closed, and the kids were in dire need of haircuts.  I'm so glad we found this place because it will be our new regular shop from now on.

Everyone was super friendly, starting from the moment we walked in.  The wait time was minimal, which was a pleasant surprise considering it was a Saturday evening.  The cuts were quick and turned out perfectly!"
Positive	Great place to stop by and grab an ice cream with the kids. It definitely beats other ice cream spots. The prices are not too bad, depending on what you get. I got the strawberries and cream or in Spanish Fresas con crema. They were delicious! No too sweet. They can also add different toppings like shredded coconut or granola, I chose not to add any. I will definitely be back next time I'm on this side of town. Oh, they don't only have ice cream. They have other goodies like raspsdos, Aguas Fresas, fruit cocktail, shakes and tortas.
Positive	I have always had a great lunch experience with Tiffany, Keri, and Tina. The staff is friendly, the service is great,  and the food is always outstanding.  We are always in and out and back to work on time.
Positive	So glad they have a cobblestone in my neighborhood!! Great  wash !! Staff is super friendly and high energy!! Definitely my care care destination!! EThey even dressed up for Halloween! A pirate even gave me a free car wash upgrade
Positive	"Yumyumyum!  And good looking, too!  This place is hot!  It is surrounded by good shopping, has a nice outdoor area for people watching or kids playing, has a coffee bar for those who haven't kicked the java habit yet :).  It basically has it all!  

I had a chicken panini on focaccia bread with pesto mayonnaise.  It was delicious but I'll warn you it was very large.  Don't feel like you need to get a side salad to come up with a filling lunch.  That said...the salads looked great, as well.

The food service and cashier staff were very helpful.  They knew about the ingredients.  They knew what sold the best.  They were willing to tell you how they liked certain things prepared.  

The place was so easy to find, park at and figure out, too.  Everything was clear in terms of where the bathrooms could be found, where the condiments and paper products were and where to start in line to do your ordering.

The best part of the experience was the design, though.  This place is very modern/industrial with fun little touches like brushed steel purse hooks at the end of each table.  The bathrooms were separate stalls for the sexes, but had a terrifically outfitted co-ed sink/vanity area.  In addition, if you want to sit inside or outside they've got you covered...and I mean covered.  It felt cool inside and outside and it was kind of hot the day we went.

I'm excited to bring the kids by...there are lots of places for them to play and the kids menu looked good and was very reasonably priced ($3 for a PBJ).


Keep up the good work!"
Positive	"I know... why I am I have Pho when I am in Montreal? 

And I even there twice during my short stay?!! 

Yes, Pho Bang New York is definitely worth a repeat visit.

I suggest just order the Pho... the broth is one of the best I have... or the best I remembered... Great aroma, well seasoned with herbs, rich with beef flavour..... 

This restaurant is definitely packed! We ended up sharing a table with others and even have to step over people to get out!

The washroom is so clean... dare I say smell good?! One of the cleanest washrooms in a Vietnamese Pho joint!

Good washroom, excellent food... that really deserves a repeat visit!!"
Positive	The full service Resolution team did a fantastic job at marketing our home. So much so that it sold in 3 days and $8500 over list. The flat fee structure saved us over $8000 over what a traditional 6 percent real estate firm would have cost. If your using Resolution Realty your putting a lot more money in your pocket at the close of escrow.
Positive	"Pretty good! And another great late-night option for the eats. My wife and stopped by after most everything else was closed. The place isn't too big and is located in a small plaza a bit further away from the strip. We checked-in to get the free eggrolls, I ordered the bun bo hue, and my wife ordered pho tai. The bun bo hue was pretty good - they put a lot of good stuff in it (pork blood, pork leg, flank, etc). My wife thought her pho broth wasn't as flavorful as she's used to. The eggrolls were OK. I also ordered a lemon soda... it wasn't very soda-ey though. My wife noticed the server running around trying to find the ingredients to make it. She said that, at one point, he pulled some Mountain Dew out of the fridge and asked someone in the back (in Mandarin) if he could use that to make it. Apparently, the cooks in the back seemed to understand Mandarin and speak Cantonese. Not sure if Vietnamese is even their first language (there was another Vietnamese couple who had to ask the server ""Do you speak Vietnamese?"" and proceeded to speak to him in English).

I was surprised at the prices - more expensive than the pho places in Irvine! I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas, and for some late-night eateries. They had a sign on the wall saying something along the lines of ""Pho...the best food for a hangover"" - nice... I think we were hungover from the 15 hour Grand Canyon tour that we had just gotten back from 30 mins earlier. Well, now I know where to go when I'm starving for pho in the middle of the night!"
Positive	"I just had to give this local place that supports organic local farmers a 2nd try.  
This time I tried the Kale & Sautéed Beets Salad and Vegan Tamales.....YUM!
Loved every bite of both.  The Kale Salad was loaded with big bites of perfectly cooked beets and a delicious citrus vinaigrette. 
The Tamales were filled with beans and topped with diced tomatoes.  I didn't miss the meat or cheese at all and I'm not a vegetarian! It was served with a scrumptious artichoke dip that was a creamy and cool topping to this pipping hot dish.

Way to go Saber....you nailed every part of this meal!"
Positive	I absolutely loved this hotel. We had a room up on the 23rd floor but the view sucked and I still love this hotel. One of our sinks was clogged the day we got there but I still love this hotel. The sound on the TV in our bedroom was horrible but I still love this hotel. The peephole on the door was missing so people could totally look into our room but I still love this hotel. Even after all that, I really do still love the hotel. It was 8 guys in the room the beds were awesome, the bathroom was awesome, the living area was awesome. I would definitely stay here again! Especially since I'm a Club Grazie member now.
Positive	I've never had a bad experience at the Old Fashioned! The cheese curds are the best in Madison, and the dips they come with are delicious! The restaurant is quite busy at dinner time, but it's the perfect location for an afternoon lunch or late night drink. Also, karaoke!
Positive	"My most favorite place to shop. And yes, I'll drive the 25-30 minutes to get there.  Plus, I don't mind hanging out@Dana Park afterwards (Pei Wei, AJ's, Francesca's.).  

It's a shopper's dream!"
Positive	"I've tried several of the Auto Bell's in this area & I've found this one to have an excellent staff & thorough service.  

I like that they are personable & friendly as well as efficient."
Positive	They did a really good job cleaning up my dirty, shabby cocker spaniel and the job can't be beat! He looks and smells so good.We will definitely be coming back. Thanks Hot Dogs and Cool Cats!
Positive	"Who doesn't want breakfast for $1 or a meal for $5? AND be able to walk it off in a fun environment right after? Don't forget the free coffee or tea for IKEA family members!

I come and eat here whenever I go on an IKEA trip. IKEA is far from my house but worth the drive to spend some time in a big warehouse with your loved ones. It's fun to grab a bite before you start on your adventure.

Don't get me wrong, it's not gourmet food. But it's cheap, good meals for you to snack on and get your energy for the long walks you're about to go on.

I've had their breakfast and lunch food and it is worth what you pay. The best part is eating in the big area with the nice windows looking out on the Vegas valley."
Positive	"Song cooks has now become my favourite Korean restaurant in Mississuaga. I love that that they have seasonal specials and can't get enough of the hwe dup bap. The serving size is extremely generous, service is prompt and efficient, and they don't skimp on the bachan's. 
Also, no other Korean restaurant here has such an authentic ambiance and decor."
Positive	"The Zip Line was more exciting than expected.  The one reason for this is because the ride doesn't have a over the shoulder harness.  I'm used to a harness and this safety device holds you in place and makes you feel strapped in and secure.  The VooDoo Zip Line is safe don't get me wrong, but it has a double seat belt that allows you to swing over and look down and that alone is extremely scary.  I took my dad on the ride and when I showed him the day earlier he was afraid, but he was ok with the ride.  I also got the GoPro of the ride, but haven't viewed it yet.  

Another cool feature is that you ride the glass elevator to the top of the Rio and into the VooDoo Lounge.  The view from the VooDoo Lounge is the best in Las Vegas.  It's basically a panoramic view of the strip.  Not sure which news channel, but they show the weather from the VooDoo Lounge and also the New Years fireworks.  

I had a great time and would recommend for people who are in the area and enjoy the fresh air and beautiful views.  Don't forget to spend some time in the lounge at night and watch the flair bartenders.  They are really funny and entertaining."
Positive	"For those that don't know, this is a Professional Beauty Supply And you must have a professional license to shop here. All Cosmoprof serve only the salon professionals. 

Friendly staff. First time I came here I wasn't in their system and so my pro card wasn't working. They took the time to re-enter my information in the system, which was nice. - but I felt bad for the person waiting behind me."
Positive	"Mimi is so talented! She is quick and clean with her work. The salon is beautiful and they are still making updates to it to make it nicer. I find myself going back again and again after trying to give others a chance, but no one compares. 

The pricing is comparable to normal salons with gel manicures around 20-30$ and pedicures starting around $23."
Positive	Everything was amazing! My family loved this cute new ramen spot. Vegetarian and vegan options! Awesome appetizers. We tried the age tofu, short ribs, and sweet potato fries and were not disappointed with any of our choices! The beef donburi was super tasty! Veggie ramen was on point and the char siu ramen was our favorite. Customer service was great as well. Everyone was so friendly!
Positive	Second time visiting this place and both times were delicious. We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a turkey club; the sandwiches came with a choice of chips, waffle fries, or hash browns... we chose the waffle fries. The meal was delicious and well priced at $6.95 (did not order drinks, water was available by condiments counter).  There's a huge menu on the wall; it can look intimidating so just grab a menu near the register if you need extra time. I love that the first items on the menu are desserts; they deserve their place, front and center!
Positive	This is our favorite Arcadia dive bar & they have the BEST wings in town! They can't be beat, I promise {Other local restaurants have tried to copy their ways and can't compare!} It's full of Arcadia locals and the best place to visit on a Saturday afternoon to watch sports, grab an ice cold beer and devour wings with great company! {People are always picking up to-go orders of wings, they're THAT good!} If you're a wing addict like me, you MUST go! {When I'm feeling healthy, I'll order a grilled chicken salad and have them toss the chicken in buffalo sauce!} Their ranch is also aaaamazing!
Positive	"Having a neighborhood go-to breakfast/deli is a must and I think this place just be some my go-to.

I have lived in this city for 9 months now and cannot believe it took that long to discover this gem. Owens is tucked away inside the pavilion in south end with somewhat limited parking options. 

The inside is very casually. Writing, scribbles, graffiti, hieroglyphics, and artwork adorns the walls along with stickers, college pendants, and signs with what I imagine to be regular customer's special orders.

The bagels are all fresh daily and the steam the sandwiches. I highly recommend the bialy. They are small but unique, flavorful and delicious.

The menu is humongous...overwhelming really. In addition to that, their are individually created variations mounted above the deli counter. It's usually busy and I always find myself rushing to figure out what I want. My first visit I was hurried into ordering and settled on the Mary's grubby bubbly. It was on the small size because of the bagel, but superb.

On the second visit I had a custom creation of sprouts, bacon, mayo, provolone, lettuce, and avocado on an everything bagel and was equally impressed.

I am so incredibly excited to have found this place and am sure I will be back very soon!"
Positive	"I had Performance Muffler install a Stillen catback on my Titan and I couldn't be happier with the experience (and the end product!).  Very reasonably priced as well.
If you need a custom exhaust or have a problem with your stock system, go see Russ.  He's got all the top brands and is a very skilled tech."
Positive	Superior Service throughout both transactions of selling and buying our home!  Corey and his staff were an absolute dream to work with.  Corey always had MY best interest at heart, even when it was not the easiest or fastest route to go!  They took care of all the details and kept me on track of what to do when!  This was my 5th experience purchasing a home and by far the busiest time in my life.  I am a single mom and own my own business so selling and listing a home was never going to come at a good time....Corey really stepped up to the plate!  My home was on the market, listed and sold in less than a week.  He prompted me (which I need!) through all the steps along the way.  I will most definitely use Corey again as well as insist my family and friends use him!
Positive	Great place for pizza while in Vegas. We sat at a table near the bar and experienced fantastic service from both, our server and the bartender. Food came out quick and hot and the beer was cold. The atmosphere is open with lots going on. We will make this on of our regular stops on our annual Vegas trips.
Positive	I LOVE King of Pops!! They are a great organization that is dedicated to their community and customers. The creative flavored are always interesting. At the end of each season they invite the community for free pops and entertainment. Makes me love them more
Positive	"My other half and I were heading over to our bank in this area and noticed a sign about car buying from AAA and realized there was an office there!
WOW! My hubs needed to get his disabled license plate taken care of and was dreading going to the MVD so we thought we'd check and see if they offer this service and lo and behold they did!
Boy, you should have seen the relief and huge smile on his face as it was taken care of!
We waited less then 10 minutes to be helped and the woman who got the job done us was very friendly and fast!
Thank You for being there AAA and so close to home.
 We will be back soon for travel needs!"
Positive	"Since Hubby thinks he's Chinese (I don't have the heart to tell him he's not!), we eat Chinese food on a regular basis. Tired of our usual spots, we decided to come here to mix things up. It's a little hidden as it's located at the back of the plaza. Despite its location, it was busy for a Monday night!

The first sign that a place is authentic is when 99% of its guests are Chinese. That was definitely the case here at Yunnan Garden. With one look around the restaurant, I knew I was in for some real Chinese cuisine! We ordered the Chicken Fried Rice and Sweet & Sour Fish. The fried rice was fresh and tasty with the right amount of green onions and egg. I did find the portion to be a little small for it just being rice. Our next dish, however, made up for the small serving. We were given a HUGE plate full of fried fish that had been tossed in sweet & sour sauce. The fish was so crispy which I loved since the heavy sauce can sometimes make it soggy. The flavor itself was nice and tangy! As delicious as it was, we couldn't finish all of the food so we ended up taking almost half of it home.

From its authentic food to its fast-paced service, this Chinese restaurant is all around traditional. That means you can also enjoy hot green tea during your meal. I did hear that Yunnan Garden is known for their Szechuan cuisine. As a lover of spicy foods, I am super eager to come back and try one of these dishes. So you can expect a check-in here from us very shortly!"
Positive	"I have been coming to the Scottsdale Princess for a couple of decades, and in my experience, it's the best hotel in the area.  However, as much as I love this place, there is room for improvement in a few areas.

The positives are many:  

- The physical property is absolutely gorgeous, with pastel-colored Spanish style buildings spread out over beautifully-kept grounds.   The architecture is quite interesting, with intriguing angles and pathways.  

- The luxurious, top-of-the-line spa is in a separate building on the property and is my very favorite spa of all time.  In all the years I have been coming here, I have gotten massages and body treatments, and all the technicians have been excellent.  Aside from a substantial menu of treatments/services you can get, there is a eucalyptus-scented steam room, waterfalls, Swiss showers, an inhalation room, and more.  There is also a good-sized gym with cardio machines, weights, etc. and some fitness classes.  This trip I took a Pilates Mat class with Tisha, who was terrific.  

- There are several swimming pools.  The one I frequented was the South pool, which is huge.  It has a sufficient number of lounge chairs, and water with and without lemon is provided for the guests.  In most daytime hours there are servers walking around offering to get you food or drinks.  

- There are a number of excellent restaurants on the property with a variety of cuisines to choose from (American, Mexican, steak, Asian/Latin).  This trip I ate at all of them and enjoyed my meals every time.  

- The ""double-double"" room I had (we were two women sharing) was perfect, with two beds, two sinks, plenty of drawer/shelf space, and a balcony.  

- Overall the staff was very pleasant, friendly, and accommodating.  

The negatives:

- The counter top in our room's bathroom, although beautiful, was the type that when you run water in the sink, it floods the counter top.  I don't remember this happening in previous stays, though I have experienced this phenomenon in other hotels.  It is very annoying!  Throughout the hotel stay, I found myself wiping up water every time I used the sink--otherwise you're left with a wet mess.  Who wants that?

- The South Pool had no service before 11am.  In late August, the early morning is the best time to be at the pool.  You can be there, but there are no servers or even water provided.  I feel 8:30 or 9am would be a more appropriate time for full service to be provided--or at the very least, for the guests to easily access cold water.

- There were a few instances where I felt that the customer service was lacking.  I felt I needed to ""fight"" for what I deserved, as opposed to the seamless experience expected of a 5-star hotel.  I was overcharged for the spa services, which took up my time on the phone post-checkout to get corrected.  In another instance the front desk person at the spa told me I would need to pay a fee for something which was included in the package I had booked.  I brought a printout of my confirmation in order to prove this.  This lack of proper training of the spa staff caused me stress and annoyance.  The discrepancies eventually did get resolved, and I got exactly what I should have gotten to begin with, but no more.  When a service provider is in error causing customer inconvenience, I feel they should offer some kind of additional compensation.  It was disappointing that apparently the hotel's philosophy is not the same.

I will return to the Scottsdale Princess, as the positives do outweigh the negatives.  Hopefully management will implement the changes suggested here by my next stay, and I will be able to give it the maximum rating it almost deserves now."
Positive	Very friendly attentive check-in staff.   Room with a beautiful city and river view.   The hotel is bike and dog friendly!  Great NYE party with a good band.   Down the street from the theater district and all of the festivities.  The concierge, valet and porter staff was excellent.   Brought a refrigerator to the room gratis.
Positive	First time here and was a great experience! Took my sister out for her 21st and came upon this place through a quick Google search. A quick skim through was good enough for me for a last minute decision. Cover charge was $10pp. They offered seating but that costs extra, too much extra that we didn't bother  even in painful heels. Very small bar and crowded but still had a good time. They have a guy playing (great) music on the piano, had the whole bar singing and dancing along. Was able to snag a spot for 3 at the bar to just stand and drink. Too loud to really talk but still enjoyed the environment. Beers were good priced about 8/piece considering it's Vegas. I'm not sure about mixed drinks, never got any. From what I skimmed through, didn't see anyone eating so I don't think they offered food which is fine since it's in the middle of all sorts of places to eat in the casino. We had a great time, would go again. Would recommend to those who don't expect an extravagant experience and come open minded for a good time :)
Positive	Love this place. The soup is definitely my favorite. Salads are big and filling. Some idiot said their chicken tasted liked it was processed. Not in my salads. Their smoothies however I'm not a big fan of. The ingredients were fresh but kind reminded me of the pea green mush on an infomercial for blenders. Love everything else.
Positive	"I enjoyed my outdoor skating experience at The Bentway last weekend. The Christmasy lights and decor just makes the place so lively and festive. It is located underneath the Gardiner Expressway, at the Fort York National Historical Site. It is walking distance from CNE, streetcar stops and a nearby paid parking lot.

The 'Village' has a skates rental shop. $10 per person for 2 hours. The staff will also ask you to leave one piece of ID with them (per group). The skates are very new, so they are not broken into yet... you might find them a bit tight around the ankle area. Perhaps wear a thicker pair of socks would help. Small lockers are available for rental (bring a toonie!), and there is an ATM machine on site.

The 'Village' also has a security-guarded, lounge area for you to relax in front of the fire pit, and grab a drink or two (alcoholic and non-alcoholic available). The funny thing is that the bartenders ask for ID when they serve you alcohol and you realize your ID is at the rental shop lmao. #facepalm #worstfeelingEVER

The ice is well-maintained by an ice resurfacer from time to time. It might get a bit watery in the beginning, so be careful, especially at that 'sharp' turn ;) Please note: If you are new at skating, this might not be a good skating spot for you, there is nothing you can hold on to!!

I'd love to come back to skate again... would be nice if there are food trucks as advertised! Until next time; happy skating and stay warm!

Opening hours:
Mon-Thurs: 11am-9pm, rentals available 4pm-9pm
Fri-Sat: 11am-11pm, rentals available all day
Sun: 11am-9pm, rentals available all day"
Positive	What a great buffet! We went around 10am so it was a mixture of brunch and more lunch food. I love how they had authentic tastes of everything, the masala, hot and sour soup, and country food to name a few. Everything was fresh, they were constantly making na'an bread, and the staff were awesome at clearing our table and refilling our mimosas. Speaking of, go during the week! The buffet with unlimited alcohol was only 40 bucks. And did I mention how amazing their dessert table was? You need to check them out.
Positive	Love this place.  Always friendly and they're open 7 days a week! It's a full service salon.  Manicures, pedicures, waxing, tanning and massages. They have a pedicure special that includes sugar scrub, callous removal, foot and leg massage with mint lotion along with a neck and shoulder massage plus all the usual components of a pedicure for $35! They also do top notch eyebrow waxing.  It
Positive	Great new hole in the wall for us...actually thought I was going to another restaurant, but glad I found this. Carne asada burritos were packed with fresh grilled steak, 2 salsas were spicy and great and we'll be back. had 4 casablanca fans going but still was a bit warm and only the 2 employees and me were there so may want to crank on the A/C
Positive	"I was pleasently surprised after checking into the Rennaisance to find that they not only have an affordable breakfast option, but a great one at that!  Though the selection was somewhat limited, the food was really tasty and they had a fresh omlette station where the omlettes were made fast and with no gooey grossness.  Maybe its just me but it feels like every time I get an omlette its watery and not cooked all the way, but the guys here have the art of omletting down.  Great bet for a weekend brunch!

Oh! and for you football/baseball fans, Arriba has floor to ceiling views onto the Rogers Center field!"
Positive	"My trip to the Le Village Buffet can be summed up in one word : PRIME-RIB.

I've been reading a number of the reviews on here, and not a lot of positive is being said about it, but for some reason, when a group of 6 of us made our way into the Le Village Buffet.. the Prime Rib was the toast of the table.  It was juicy, succulent, and would fall apart just by cutting it with the side of your fork.  Also, we checked out Prime Rib at the buffets at both the Rio and Planet Hollywood and they paled in comparison.

The selection here was not 'worldly,' but it did offer a variety of good desserts and there were a number of vegetarian options for those in our party that had to avoid the meaty goodness.

Another standout was the omelette bar, which had a ton of options and really was surprisingly good.

Our server Debra was very polite and kept our bottomless mimosas full (we went on Sunday for brunch, where apparently it is always free).  She made us smile.

For Le Village Buffet, anytime is Prime-time."
Positive	It's a diner. Great diner food without hip pretensions and gimmicks. This place does it right with breakfast all day along with the regular menu. Service is professional. The servers are people who are over 21 and aren't more concerned with how cool they look than whether your coffee cup is full. Thankfully no changing tables in the restrooms. I don't want to smell it or even imagine it in my eating place. Diners aren't for infants. Find a Chuckie Cheese. The prices don't make you wince in pain. It ain't The Four Seasons and doesn't try to be, so get your nose out of the air and enjoy classic American comfort food at reasonable prices.
Positive	"Wow! This place is a diamond in a rough when it comes to customer service and how well they perform. Services include eyebrow threading, henna art, waxing, and facial. Not even a minute inside the store and I was greeted very kind and warmly by the staff. They ask what kind of treatment I wanted and quickly seated me. 
I've been to multiple threading places in the Vegas valley and I have to admit this place set the bar pretty dang high. Especially when you got Khina! Khina is very sweet and if you get the chance to have her work on you, you'll see very quickly why she is a true professional. I've never held my hand in different positions in order for someone to thread my eyebrows haha! Nor have I had someone who can keep a conversation going. It's as if you were already friends  with her in the past. 
I love how she pays attention to detail and redoes her work more than twice to ensure that she is satisfied with what she sees. 

Location: From Eastern you'll make a turn where U-Swirl Frozen yogurt is. And to be exact, it is neighbors to Shakespeare's Grille & Pub and Rooster's Mens Grooming. 

The store is very clean including the restroom. I love the interior design and how there's upbeat music playing in the background. To enter a store with a greeting smile and leaving the store with it shows how much these workers care about their business."
Positive	I got my iPhone 4S screen fixed because I couldn't view half my screen, it was just complete dark, after I dropped it on it's face. However, this Desert Wireless replaced my whole screen which even got rid of a little crack. My phone works perfect now, only problem is there's a little yellow digital smudge bottom left of my screen. Still, a huge improvement I would definitely return in the future if needed.
Positive	"So I braved this store on grand opening. Maybe not the best idea but all I could keep thinking was holy hell. I was in love.

The bulk section alone is reason enough to come here. Spices are highway robbery now if I even think about buying anywhere else. We got three bottles worth of ground mustard for less than a dollar. And that was just the start of my addiction of buying spices here. 

You can also get Tillamook everything here. Tillamook ice cream, yogurt, cheese, beef jerky, etc. The Tillamook Black Cherry Ice cream is where it is at.

The bakery has good items. Love the muffins, stay away from the cinnamon rolls. 

I am a pretty efficient shopper and wouldnt do all my shopping here. But i don't do all my shopping in one store anyway. I know where to get the best deals for certain items but WinCo has ALOT of great deals!

They are open 24 hours and they always seem pretty busy anytime we go, evening definately seem a better time than anything else though.

And the flyers where they include coupons for free items are a plus either. And you dont have to purchase anything to get them for free! So make sure you dont throw your winco flyers in the trash."
Positive	Thank you , you save me several times of week when there's a long day and I don't feel like cooking more so my son loves you guys. The food and customer service is superb.
Positive	Just signed up for Dance Across the Desert ( nonprofit org to help illegal immigrants find their way after being deserted by the coyote they PAID to sneak them across the border). ANYWAY, its WAY too dangerous to attempt at night so we do it in broad daylight. That being said, the ONLY way THIS GUY is dancing through the BLAZING desert  is with a BRAND NEW Panama hat because that's the ONLY logical choice. Now when you have an odd head size ( 9 11/16) it can be a DAUNTING task finding the right haberdashery. Well THIS PLACE DID NOT disappoint!! WHOOT! The gentleman , his name was either BaileyJo  or Rich ( I ALWAYS get those two names confused), was an ANGEL from hat heaven. He gave me room to browse but was RIGHT there when I needed him. Like the guy from Mr Deeds!! WSSSSSHHHHH!!LOL! He also didn't seem to mind when I utilized his leathery, straw  smelling and unexpectedly spacious amount of room to dance and  show off a few of my NEW COYOTE moves! HOOOOOOOOOUUUUUWWWWWWWW!!!!If I dont AMP IT I'll CRAMP IT!!  WHOOOT!! Gammy get my carpet slippers ready 'CUZ  IM  ABOUT TO SIDE STEP THROUGH THE SONORAN!!!  Thanks BaileyJo!! Hat homies for LIFE!! WHOOT!!
Positive	"The truffled onion veloute and seared foie gras were amazing.  I could live off of the onion veloute.  The foie gras was delicate and the entire dish was perfectly balanced. 

The service was neither here nor there.  The waiter was friendly and cute with his french accent.  The hostess, on the other hand, was a complete mindless bimbo.  

We had reservations for a late dinner.  The restaurant was pretty empty and she decided to seat us near the drunken fools who were starting to become loud and belligerent.  Really?  Our waiter switched our tables without a hitch and even commented that he didn't understand why the hostess sat us at the original table."
Positive	"Worth the drive!!!!! 

I had 7 layers of princess to hem on my daughters flower girl dress. The bride wanted this dress and they didn't make it in a small enough size for my little girl so we had to buy the smallest size then have it altered. They did an AMAZING job. The lady ended up taking up the shoulders too. 

I was so nervous because there were so many layers in the skirt and a lot of intricate seams she would have to work on. I picked it up and had my little girl try it in right there in the shop and it was perfect. Beautifully done and perfect in every way. 

They also do the alterations for several dance studios in town, so they are pros at formal wear alterations!"
Positive	I'm very picky about my nails, and I recently moved to Vegas. I found out about Nail Bar on Yelp, particularly, nail tech Ivy. My first visit with Ivy was awesome! She was very friendly, welcoming, professional, and I felt like she went above and beyond to make sure my nails were right. I normally get gel polish with a promise that it'll last for two weeks. It never has. However, since I've been going to Ivy at Nail Bar (three times now), my gel polish actually lasts two weeks. I'm pleasantly surprised. Service there is very consistent! I gave four stars only because I'm used to paying $18 for gel polish (same brand) in Atlanta, but it's $25 at Nail Bar. I'll say it's worth it though.
Positive	Graham's is amazing. The waits might be long but it's worth it. Graham is a fantastic barber who takes tons of time and care to make sure you walk out looking the way you want. I'll be back for sure.
Positive	The club sandwich and the huevos rancheros are incredible. Long wait on weekends but worth it every time. Mimosas are great as well. Was on Triple D for their pork chile verde!
Positive	I've ordered take out from here twice now, and both times the food was AMAZING. Loved the koshari, it is one of the most delicious dishes I've had from any restaurant, and as a bonus, it was filling enough that I ate it for lunch and dinner that day (a big deal for me when I'm on-the-go). The taamia is also excellent, it is Egyptian falafel made with fava beans inside pita bread with tahini and some veggies. It's a nice change from the traditional Mediterranean falafel made with chick peas. I will undoubtedly be coming back here many times!
Positive	"We could not be happier.  They have worked on both of our Jeeps 5 years apart.  3"" Teraflex Lift Kit on both - tires & wheels on both.  One of them has custom wheels with custom painted milled accents to match and Poison Spyder body armor.  I had trouble deciding which wheels to go with and Konrad explained the pros and cons of both so I could make a decision.  Konrad, Scott and everyone there was great (wish I could remember more names but there was not one person that was not great) .  They told me an easy way to get the decals off without issue & fixed some stickers that I had put on incorrectly.  I was down there almost everyday like a stalker checking on the progress and everyone was great about it - didn't seem irritated with me at all.  I would recommend T.A.P. to everyone and do.  We will be back for more work soon."
Positive	Sunday 7pm party of 6, sat on the patio to enjoy the weather. We ordered the vegetarian platter, chicken kabob plate, salmon plate, a couple wraps, some appetizer pastries, chocolate cake. We were delivered some fresh and hot bread to snack on while waiting. Everything was good although I probably would have been fine with only the vegetarian platter because it had quite a few good things to eat with the bread. Service was good and the place was nice looking. Tasty sauces to accompany the meals.
Positive	"Wow! That's all I can say.
 I got a great cut, at a great price, and had some pretty rad company. 
The place smells great and is really chill. 

If you're a woman or trans* folk looking for a classic barber cut and are tired of being turned away from other barber shops, this is the place to be! The owner and I had a whole conversation about being a friendly and inclusive space. Yes, read trans* and women inclusive/friendly barber shop!

I don't think I've ever looked so good. Thanks Chris!"
Positive	Michael is not only an amazing artist, but also an amazing person. 15 years deep going to the same guy, we have developed a great bond and he is a great guy. Check him out for your next piece.
Positive	My daughter and I were headed to the Chipotle and decided to try Nevada Chicken that is next door and we were glad  we did . I had the 1/2 chicken with two sides . Mashed potato sand a garden salad . My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious. We will come back .
Positive	Bought online - pretty straight forward. The tracker is cool because you know the status of your order. Delivery guy was nice and conversational. He actually may have liked his job! Which says something about Dominos IMO...and FYI I gave 4 stars because the Marinara sauce pack was already open...no one's perfect!
Positive	"ESPRESSO! Excellent shot of espresso. I rank it up there with the best I've ever had. Could tell it was going to rock when I saw/smelled it. Creamy, velvety. Delicious caramelized finish. From start to finish, dare I say, a perfect shot? Yes, I dare. Obviously care about their roasting. The fact that we're staying next door at NYNY makes it even better. 
Wife had the mocha. Not overly sweet like commercial crapresso ones. I prefer a cap or plain latte if I'm feeling like milk. I want to taste coffee in every drink. 
Almond and choc croissants were very good. Very flakey. Great chocolate. No weird fake-almond aftertaste. 
Friendly staff. Will hit it a couple of more times before we leave. 
Typical strip upcharge, but nothing to make me look elsewhere for my espresso."
Positive	I scheduled an appointment in advance and was worried the wait would still be long given the tons of people waiting inside when I first walked in. Luckily the waiting part wasn't too long, just a bit uncomfortable. I have to say the girls working at the receptionist desk were very courteous and helpful. I was greeted right away and asked who I was there to see so I could get checked in. Finding a seat wasn't easy at first since it was a zoo inside. After finding a seat and filling out some paperwork, not on actual paper, I was given a tablet..modern day technology!, I was back seeing the doctor within about 15 minutes. The doctor came in and asked questions and then did some procedures and gave me after care instructions. I was relieved that it didn't turn into an all day waiting event just to be seen and that the staff was friendly.
Positive	"replace the ""r"" in rumjungle with a ""c"" and that's the reputation of this place.  i don't get it though, because this place wasn't even remotely sleazy and i did not see a lot of douche-y guys/scantily-clad ladies around.

i was in vegas for a business trip this past week, and a group of us young people went to *umjungle for dinner, and ended up closing the place down.  the food was really yummy (and not your typical vegas hotel restaurant fare), except for the turkey, which was too salty.  all you can eat for $34 (recession pricing) more than makes up for it though, because you can order any of the other meatstuffs available.  i didn't get too adventurous with the cocktails, but their by-the-book cocktails did not disappoint.

this place is GREAT for dancing if you don't want to hit a big loud commercial club like blush/pure/tryst/bodyenglish/etc.  the DJ (an asian girl!) was amazing and played a variety of music (jesse's girl, anyone?), although there were some songs that were good for a drink break.  i wasn't even in a dancing mood when i went out for dinner on wednesday night, seeing how i'd been sleep-deprived for days by that point, but surprisingly ended up shaking my tailfeathers for 3 hours.

i recommend."
Positive	"Just came back from another successful fish taco Tuesday mission.  Every Tuesday after 3:30 they have fish tacos for $1.75 each.   Or you can get the upgraded version for 25 cents more which has guacamole and cheese.   Worth it in my opinion.   

The only reason it's not a 5 star experience is because the fish is mostly breeding.  If it was more meat under that delicious airy breeding then I'd give it 5 stars.  

What is 5 stars???  Answer: The service for a casual Mexican food place (the wait time and friendliness of the staff) and the selection of sauces.   

Fish tacos are almost thebomb.com status.   But not quite."
Positive	"It was my first time at the new BP location. Not much changed on the patio or structurally inside since Light Bistro (R.I.P.) moved out. 

We ordered the mushroom appetiser. I didn't know what to expect, but for some reason I had an image of stuffed mushrooms in my mind. Boy was I wrong. We got a very small selection of various shaped and sized mushrooms on a plate sparsely covered in lettuce. The dish was topped with a runny egg and the mushrooms tasted overall salty, but not necessarily in a bad way. This app is to be split by no more than two people as it is very small. 

I got the Petite Filet for my main. It was far from petite though. It was definitely double what other places serve as petite or ""twin medallions."" It was served with roasted cauliflower, purple and white which were amazing, and big spring onion stalks. Some of the steak was a bit too well done for me though. 

We sat on the patio. Service was slow from the kitchen and our waitress didn't check on us to often. My friend said his two cocktails were not that flavorful. All in all it was good, but it isn't my favorite in the city. I'm between a 3 & 4 on this rating. Since the mains were pretty good (my friend's burger included) I'll go with 4."
Positive	"We are very impressed with Ken. He spent as much time with us, explaining and going through details as we needed. His staff was polite, and hard-working, and they left my yard cleaner than when it started! Kudos to you Ken. Many businesses can learn from you out here! I would recommend ""Synthetic Lawns of Las Vegas"" without a second thought to anyone!"
Positive	"I still don't understand all of the complaints and low ratings.  After I  moved out I got most of my security deposit back and would happily return to live at San Marin any day! (Keep your place clean and be an adult-- it's called 'life' you have to pay if you destroy the place) If I hadn't moved out of state I would still be there.  

Its really a great place to live and I miss it a lot.  Great location. Clean and well maintained, dog friendly...

If I had to list negatives I would say that they are a little high (but you are paying for location, location, location!) and it does get loud on the weekends, lots of partying and not a lot of help or support at 3,4,5, am.  But I was young once.....

Overall great place to live!!"
Positive	I used to get to Tempe about 6 times a year and always would stop for a little Middle Eastern Flavor.  Since I am not there all time I find myself in a bit of a food rut and get the beef and lamb Shawarma.  What a beautiful rut it is!  I hear they have a good buffet, but I wouldn't know.  Unfortunately I don't get there nearly as much as I used to, but you will find me there when I get to town.
Positive	"We live about 2 blocks from the Colony, as it's locally called. We've been there multiple times - sometimes because it's one of only a couple of places in the area that serves a decent late-night bite. 

Located in a nondescript building on Lee Rd, inside is a somewhat dim, tavern style place that is very low-key and inviting. Everything we've ever had on the menu has been pretty good. Nothing I'd rave about, but for bar food, it is well above average. They have nightly specials and a little bit of flair on the menu in addition to the standard burger/fries/nachos type stuff. 

The only dig I have on this place is the service. Now, I was just there 2 nights ago and although we had a party of 12, the service was really attentive and accommodating to our desire to just sit at our (huge) table and drink and talk instead of moving to the bar. However, on pretty much every other occasion (some worse than others) the service has been slow, even annoyed when we asked for our bill after 20 min of waiting for it. Let's hope that our most recent experience is a beginning of a new trend.

A nice local spot to chill and get a good meal with yourself, a friend, or a big group. Try it out if you're in the Heights."
Positive	My daughter had a little too much fun the night before and woke up feeling not so great (pretty bad actually but cant tell her that lol) typical headache nausea throwing up..clean elegant professional facility and met with trained medic staff (thank god) offer a variety of hydration packages so they sit you down on what looked like a leather recliner with the t.v. on. She recieved the I.V with nausea medication then afterwards was back to normal...highly recommended
Positive	"Cute little Japanese-run Japanese place.

I was pumped to see 'sake oyako don' on the menu. It's a simple bowl of sushi rice, salmon sashimi, and salmon roe. I friggin love those salty, glistening, plump jewels of salty goodness. Man they're so salty and good and plump.

Note: this place doesn't have washrooms. For reals. You have to go to the parking garage like some convict.

Fun fact: 'oyako' means 'parent and child'. Get it? You're eating the adult fish, and its little babies in the same dish. Kinda sick? A little. Also, ordering 'oyako don' might get you chicken and eggs on rice (see, same deal). So check yo'self before ordering."
Positive	"If you are going to line up anyways (which you should be prepared to do for the 11AM dim sum special), then you might as well wake up a little early and do so at 9AM for the restaurant opening. That way you can be the first batch in and avoid being one of those who peek through the decorative screen at other people's Siu Mai, 'cause that just makes everyone uncomfortable. But I know, easier said than done. :P

Overall the food quality is very high. Shrimp dumplings had lots of fresh shrimps, soft tofu dessert melts right in your mouth and is delightfully tofu-y, and the beef tripe had just the right degree of chewiness. My highlight was the pumpkin shaped pastry, not too sweet, sticky and warm on the inside, plus they look so cute!

The service was only so-so. I don't think they have the best dim sum order taking system down, what with not being able to mark things down freely after the initial order and having different staff responsible for order taking and food delivery, but whatever, we cope. Wasn't so nice when the order taking lady gets called over by her colleague and barked at us 'what did you order that second time? what are you trying to tell me?'... maybe let us talk first? 

I also find it slightly awkward that some of their dishes have three-people portions, isn't usually four the ideal number? But I guess for big groups this is less of an issue since you end up ordering multiple helpings anyways...

In all a good experience. I wouldn't mind coming again for sure, or I might try some of the other fancier dim sum places, then again my heart has a special place for those traditional dim sum carts pushed by smiley and sometimes pushy Cantonese ladies. Call me old-fashioned."
Positive	Has all my favorite Japanese food prep supplies. You will find any Asian food Staples that you would need for any dish and the dishes to serve and cook them too. Love this Store!!!
Positive	The menu is good for a lovely lunch. I believe you will enjoy the appetizers in place of your main meal. We really enjoy the seafood served here. Grilled jerk shrimp skillet is amazing!!! Also, my appetizer was a crab meat atop of shrimp tower and avocado and pineapple. The picture shows a tower up on a red spicy sauce that is really hot,but works great with the pineapple and avocado. Enjoy!!  Sometimes a group of servers can get you that five star rating. This group is almost there, but don't be sad if you are not dazzled by the service (just B- on service).
Positive	Oh my goodness, this restaurant was a terrific Yelp find while we're on vacation! We had salmon sashimi (8 pc/$13), yellowtail sashimi (8 pc/$13), a roll with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, cucumber, and avocado (something like H3? 10pc/$13 or $14), 2 orders both unagi (eel) and spicy scallop nigiri (2 pc per order/$not cheap but worth it), and my husband had the special spanish mackerel. The pieces are large, presented with lovely and delicious garnish, and very fresh on a Monday night. Also had 2 miso soup, a seaweed salad, 1 hot tea, and 2 small bottles of very good quality sake. If you like strong wasabi, try the fresh wasabi. It packs a different but not unpleasant type of punch compared with the regular reconstituted paste. Altogether $120 plus tip. Service was pleasant and attentive. We normally wouldn't feast like this on a Monday night but hey on vacation, it's ok to live a little. Totally worth it.
Positive	Thought I'd try out V's this week.  My haircut was just as I asked for and I got so much more.  As it turns out, I had a medical emergency upon checkout that put my life in danger.  I applaud Kimberly and all of her staff for knowing what to do to keep me alive until paramedics arrived. They were all very concerned for my well being that day, and followed up the next day to ensure I was OK. I can't thank them enough for their amazing support.  I will definitely return.
Positive	"I am so happy I pick Farmers Insurance, this was the best decision I ever made, the office personnel is the BEST!! always helping me with my questions, when my daughter got rear ended I found out just how awesome Farmers Insurance people are including customer service, getting everything in order to make things easy!! you don't find people like this especially in auto insurance companies - If you are looking for people to trust and be there when you need them the most, this office is AWESOME!!! and so is customer service.
VERY HAPPY WITH FARMERS INSURANCE!!!
Thank you guys!!

Positive	Great BBQ.  Had the pork sandwich with homemade pickles.  Beans and mac and cheese were amazing as well. Staff was very helpful and nice.  Was in from Los Angeles for vacation and would love to come back next time we are in town.
Positive	"This place is FUN. Came here on a Sunday to kill the morning with bottomless mimosas and had a fantastic time doing it. RnR was spacious and had misters and fans throughout the patio and balcony, so chilling in the hot Phoenix sun was easy. A dj was spinning some pretty bumping beats and the waitress was generous with the mimosa pours. 

Two people at the table ordered the hangover killer and I really wish I had gotten that. Looked and smelled delicious. I got the scramble which wasn't nearly as great. 

I was definitely here for the atmosphere and fun though, so I didn't mind the scramble. Had a great time with friends and that's the vibe I'll remember RnR for."
Positive	"Hard-core Mexican dive. If you're white, you will likely be the only one in the place when you walk in. If you're brown like me, you will likely be spoken to in Spanish which will make you feel stupid since... lo siento pero no hablo (mucho) espanol. 

The parking lot is scary. So is the area in general. If you're lucky there will be a singer inside pounding away at a cheezy keyboard and rocking the place with Mexican pop hits. The mushroom enchilada is my favorite entree. Others I or friends have tried have all been awesome. The service is great, as it's provided by family folks who own the place. 

If you want the Disney version of a Mexican restaurant, stay away. But if you crave the real stuff, made by Mexicans for Mexicans served in a Mexican atmosphere, Oaxaca is for you."
Positive	"I used to go to the west side Chic fil A until this opened. I was here the day it opened and have been here at least 50times. Service is usually quick, they are always friendly, the food is always hot , freshly cooked and the sauce selection is extensive and they all taste nice. Some employees even come around asking if you would like a refill. Even though its been extremely busy Ive always found a place to sit. There is plenty of parking unless someone pulls up with a trailer and takes up 10 spots. 

Ive been through the drive thru several times and that moves quick. 
 

There is a children's play area and that keeps the little ones busy. 

This would be my favorite fast food chain by far BUT only gets 4 stars as they are not open Sundays. I understand a few reasons for businesses to stay closed on Sundays but if everywhere was closed and you're travelling or out nobody would eat."
Positive	this place is..................da bomb!!!! the food is all fresh and ingredients are local. i had the best food experience here. the staff here are very friendly and don't bug you like most restaurant waiters by hovering over you or listening about the questionable night you had the night before. thé  environment here is relaxed with nooo stuck-up people here. this place is a great place for lovers and families.  i love you guys man!!!
Positive	"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday at lunch time and we were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and gave us 2 chips & salsas. Not sure what they put on their chips, but they were yummy and fresh!
I ordered the Korean galbi flank steak tacos, which came with rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, the meat was well marinated and the kimchi slaw added the perfect touch! The rice that it came with was a bit crunchy for my liking, but had a good spicy kick to it. 
My boyfriend ordered the miso pork belly burger. It was huge! The pork belly was an added touch to an already good burger. 
This is defiantly a place I would visit again!"
Positive	We were looking for a late nite bite. Although nobody called us dude (sir) it was only because we were old enough to be everyone's parents. No matter, the service was enthusiastic and personal, the food delicious, the atmosphere authentically hipster. I had the fried green (red) tomato sandwich which was positively nuclear, the way I like it. Health food no doubt. What a great place. Wish we could have had some drinks because they had interesting ones, but my companion had Hurricane Juice and said it was the best juice he ever had. A mix of fresh juices would definitely benefit from rum.
Positive	I love sushi and they have awesome sushi for such great price! Been there twice already for a to-go order and I was blown away by the the quality of the food! I asked for a side of habanero sauce and  extra ginger. They have me a months supply of sushi ginger.. lol. Amazing prices and great lunch menu deals.
Positive	"I have never written an online review before, but - after my experience at Performance Footwear on 3/14/15 - I feel compelled to write one now.

My daughter is a freshman on her high school track team, and she needed (we thought) a pair of training shoes for practice runs & a pair of racing flats for meets.  We visited a local sporting goods store which had a very limited supply of running shoes in her size (on the small side).  The salesman recommended Performance Footwear and said that if anyone could meet our needs, it was them.

We were assisted by Brandi, who listened to my daughter's concerns about some ankle pain she was experiencing while running.  Brandi had my daughter run on the treadmill and showed us the video which revealed that she had some issues with overpronation.  Brandi then brought out several pairs of shoes suited to my daughter's needs and let her try on and test out as many as she wanted.

After a while, the owner (Tom) came into the store and began to answer all of our questions and taught us all kinds of things about the science of running that we didn't know before.  My daughter found a pair of shoes that she loved, and then Tom told her that, because of her overpronation issues, she should use the one pair of shoes for both training and for meets.  Tom could have easily sold us another pair of racing flats, but he knew she didn't need them.  

My daughter and I were extremely impressed with the level of customer service we received, the quality of the shoes we purchased, and -above all - the patience and integrity shown by Tom and his staff.  We gained a ton of knowledge and my daughter found an answer to her ankle pain.  That alone was (to me) worth 10 times the amount of money I paid for the shoes.  We'll definitely be return customers for our future footwear needs!"
Positive	"Started with the best sangria I have had in LV at happy hour prices.  Made me very happy.  It had none of that nasty after taste.  Chips were warm and dusted with a light peppery seasoning with three good salsas. Had to try an order of guacamole with them.  For appetizers we had an amazing sauted calamari salad (usually can only find fried in LV) and mini tacos, chicken and beef.  Entrees were Kobe beef skirt steak perfectly cooked medium rare and shrimp in a husk with a corn mash.  We were much too full for dessert.
The waiter was very professional and had no problem with special requests and knew all of the ingredients.  Manager and chef were very friendly and welcoming.  Dining room is beautiful, including white table cloths on tables, and settees and chairs at the table.  Location and parking are a breeze.
I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.  The best Mexican restaurant in town!"
Positive	Christy did an amazing job , my lashes look so full and pretty & natural . Not only did she make me look flawless , she also fixed the clumps I had in them from before& took the time to do so  . I'm definitely gonna be waking up like this  & Ashley at the front desk was so sweet , helped me right away & was very easy to talk too ! Definitely my new spot
Positive	"You know that rare club that has friendly people, runs an efficient ship, bangs out amazing drinks, has plenty of seating, great music....clearly I could keep going on forever.

Arrived at 2am and left at 7am, those five hours were packed with a steller time. Definitely the club I would recommend to others and will be my spot each time Im in Vegas."
Positive	"On Las Vegas Boulevard without being caught up in the chaos of the strip. My friends and I stopped by this bar to grab a drink and a quick bite before we headed to a movie at the South Point. Knowing that the casino would be packed, we came here.

At first, I was  hesitant to come because my first experience was disappointing. This second time, it was better. We entered around 10pm and sat ourselves at one of the side booths. The wait staff were slow to acknowledge our presence, but after we made it clear we were there, they were more attentive. 

The menu is extensive and that can backfire. Like I said, my first experience had me never wanting to come back. I didn't care for their chili. I was impressed with the extensive salad choices. On Thursday, they have a  BBQ chicken served over cold soba noodles with tons of veggies tossed in. The marinade for the chicken remind me of the Chinese style BBQ except it was more salty than sweet. The half portion was 8.95 and was enough to tide me over. I was trying to be healthy, but could not help stealing my friends fries. They were thick cut and fried to a golden brown. Absolutely perfect.

A bonus, they were playing so much 90's alternative. Nothing like some Smashing Pumpkins and Bush to remind me of my childhood."
Positive	"This nail salon is under new ownership and is very customer focus. The owner really cares about doing a good job and ensuring that customers are happy, even to the point of accommodating  customers even past closing time as well as accommodating customer before opening time.

Great new management !!"
Positive	My Benny Goodman was tasty!!! Have StarChild (bartender) make you an awesome MmmMmm Mimosa. She is super friendly and has great eye makeup!! Thank you for a delicious breakfast and great service.
Positive	This place is out of this world good! We are two vegans who took some non-vegans out to eat at the Wynn who have never been there before. The vegan options were so amazing that I forgot to take photos of them! Our friends really enjoyed their dishes as well. The wait staff was amazing and very attentive to our needs. A little on the pricey side, but well worth having a spectacular meal on our vacation.
Positive	Always a Hooters fan. Rooms are decent for the price. Nothing luxury. If you are looking for cheap and close to the strip, then this is your spot. Also if you love hot wings, then the 24 hour hooters restaurant downstairs is the spot to be!
Positive	"Mountainside fitness knows what a visit to the gym should be - clean, with great equipment, at a reasonable price.

Rumor has it that this location at Chase Field was actually for advertising.  If you ever go, you'll notice that the membership is really low.  Most of the time the gym is empty with maybe 5-10 people working out at any given time.  It's great for members though because you never have trouble finding a machine or weights.

The equipment is all in excellent condition and they definitely keep the place really clean. It doesn't have a pool, basketball court, or racquetball - but it does have plenty of weight machines downstairs with cardio machines upstairs.  I've never seen a class, but they do have them (just not a very robust schedule).  I like to go at lunch since my work is nearby.  The locker rooms are always clean (which is really important to me) and they provide clean towels as part of their standard membership.

And don't worry, the windows are covered so you won't be stared at like a fish tank if there is an event at Chase field."
Positive	"I am reviewing only the Sunday brunch.

First and foremost, this place is absolutely gorgeous, and very old school.  The Old Mill has a rich history and was designated a heritage site in 1983.  As of 2001, they added a hotel and spa.  The complex is built in the style of Tudor Revival Architecture and is also a venue for weddings.  The restaurant is located in a very attractive hall within the complex.  

The buffet is plentiful.  There is a table for salads, a table for cold seafood (such as 'peel and eat shrimp', smoked mackerel, cold muscles, etc.), a table for cold cuts, a table for cheese and breads, a buffet of offerings and a desert table.  
All of the food is quite tasty and is replenished often.

In addition, there's a chocolate fountain!  They say that ""feedback is the breakfast of champions"", so how about a chocolate feedback to start off your day?

An added bonus is that the Old Mill is nestled right next to the beautiful and lush Humber River.  After your brunch, you can take a stroll along the beautiful Discovery Trail and try to burn off some of those calories :-)"
Positive	"I went to Panera to try the new broth bowls offered.  I also ordered salad and customized one how I preferred. A very nice thoughtful employee, Asia, came to the table and spent a lot of extra time explaining the vegan options at great length that we can order.  She genuinely cared if we received something that met our preference.  This type of service isn't common and makes us want to keep coming back.  We want to thank this person for going the extra mile to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. 
Thank you!"
Positive	"Overall, a pretty decent resort. Not the best or most glam, but nice and a great value. 

Staff was very friendly! 

Our room was clean and spacious. It wasn't the most modern and updated room, but pretty nice had everything we needed. I liked how the bathroom was in between the bedroom and living area, to provide a little sound barrier between the rooms while we slept. 

Very conveniently located right off the freeway. 

The pool area of the resort is what brought us to the property and it was overall very good! A huge pool with wading area at one end, volleyball net mid-way, and rock waterfalls to swim through and under at the other end. My boys loved this! A water slide, kiddie pool (that was too warm when we visited in mid-August), another more low-key pool for swimming, and lazy river were great additional areas to enjoy. The lazy river was maybe the laziest I have ever been in - a little too lazy and slow. Wish there was just a little more push. And one evening, they had it closed because there was broken glass, but there were no posted signs (we heard via word of mouth) and we saw no one cleaning it up either. 

Plenty of (non-covered) parking."
Positive	I had my GF in there and even if she not familiar with that type of food she loved it. We had a great time. The service was awsome even if the place was packed.
Positive	Well where do I start? It's ultimately the best market! It's 5 mins from my house, the staff knows who I am and that's refreshing. They always ask if I need help with looking for items or to my car. The prices are about the same as Smith's market and some of the other markets I've been to so it's way more convenient in every aspect for me to go to Albertson's. Produce is always fresh and same goes for the meat, dairy and bakery! I love the deli and the staff always recommend certain brands of deli meat and cheeses. Even there pharmacy is great! Christina and Larry are awesome! Thanks Albertson's and Savon's for the best customer service above any other market! Well at least in my book they are!..:)
Positive	I have been to TOPH several times and I'm never disappointed. You may have read in other posts, yes, their omelettes are made with 6 eggs and are spectacular. Most omelettes and other dishes come with a side of pancakes. I usually stick with the omelettes, but have had several of the pancakes, all of which are delicious especially pumpkin.  I had a chance to talk to the owner and he seems like a good guy. He claims they have the best Bacon in Cleveland and he may he right, it's that good. Also, I should add the portions are huge, consider splitting a meal with someone.
Positive	"8/4/13 My wife and I stopped in and sat on the patio.  We enjoyed a 12"" build your own pizza, Greek salad, and a few beers.  After eating we went upstairs and played a quick game of Cricket.  This isn't the Echo I remembered from my youth and was glad for it.  I'm not sure when they remodeled, but I was impressed by their reinvention.  ;-)"
Positive	"I've been to coco before and I like their drinks. I came during their grand opening special for 30% all drinks. There was a line up extending to outside the shop. The line wasn't bad though. It was the wait to get your order that took extremely long. 

I can understand that they are new so they are probably figuring out how to work efficiently. 

In terms of drinks, I like their bubble Gaga, passion fruit tea, and winter melon juice.

Just like most other chains, this is a typical bubble tea shop with a wide selection of drinks and sweetness levels. Nothing stands out about coco to me. But it's a solid spot to get bubble tea."
Positive	I have been seeing Dr Sue at Mint Dentistry for years now and am always impressed with the level of service. The staff are very friendly and easy to talk to and it truly has a family feel. I've never had such a positive experience with my dentist as I do at Mint. I would highly recommend this place.
Positive	"An interesting spin on fusion and buffet dining.

Environment: Located in the M Casino, the exterior as well as the interior of the restaurant are beautiful. The inside is spacious and has an abundance of seating from regular tables, to private dining areas, and beautiful patio overlooking the pool, and even a sushi bar with some stools.

Food: The food is more all-you-can-eat sushi style than buffet in that a waiter takes your order and the food is brought to your table. However, it is one flat price, and you can choose between the Chinese section of the menu, the Japanese section of the menu, or a combination of both for a small additional charge. We went for the combination and were delighted that we could order dumplings, pho, walnut shrimp, and sushi all at once. While this may seem like somewhat of a random mashup of diff3erent types of cuisine, each was respectable. The fish was very fresh for the sushi and the honey walnut shrimps were crispy and succulent. Additionally, the portions were not too big which allowed us to pace ourselves and never get to a point where we were unable to finish the food we had ordered.

Service: Service was very good as well. It leaned more to the fine dining type of service which was nice and out waiter was very prompt in checking up on us and taking any additional orders we may have wanted to place.

Overall, Jayde Fusion provides a great reason for locals to go all the way out to the M hotel and I will likely be back soon."
Positive	"The food is the most authentic and delicious in Vegas that I've tried. Definitely better than pho Kim long and other viet restaurants I've helped to try. The pho, bo Luc lac, bun rieu were all legit and deeeeeeeelicious. Drinks- soda plum, jelly and coconut were on point too.
Authentic food coupled with attentive and very patient service! All the waiters were so nice and accommodating to a screaming and messy, but too adorable baby in our party."
Positive	"Went in on our Anniversary last week, & was pleasently surpirsed by the quality of food here. All from scratch, good service, & she even squeezed out 2 Canolis for us right b4 closing. Been recommending this mom & pop's restaurant ever since. Had 2 meals left over for the next day too. 
Only complaint, the Calimari was a bit on the salty side, but didn't stop us from finishing it lol! Definitely coming back."
Positive	Clinton was really awesome! Fixed my phone so quick and I also got the free tempered glass with the Yelp check in. He also uses quality parts, so you are definitely getting good quality and workmanship. Everything was done within 15-20 minutes also.
Positive	I have to admit I stopped coming here about a year and a half ago, the service took a decline when they switched teams. The last straw for me was the short brown haired girl, I believe she was the manager she had little personality and was condescending on a good day. I came in for some items for dinner and decided to try and treat myself, the whole team is new, and both girls were lovely! I went back two days later, and two different girls were just as sweet, happy to say it's made a positive change. Glad too, it's across the street from me!!
Positive	Anne is a pleasure to work with and her photos have always turned out beautifully! She has taken family pictures for us the last 3 years. She does a wonderful job capturing photos of kids even when they aren't cooperating! She also works well with large groups (larger family photo with 20+ people and subgroups). We will continue calling Anne for our family photos in the future!
Positive	We will definitely be back next time we visit Las Vegas. They had the best chicken wings I have ever tasted in my entire life, plus all the skewers with the various sea salts were excellent. We were worried at first because it wasn't busy at all and thought that maybe it wasn't a good restaurant. Not the case at all, so we were just lucky we didn't have to wait long for the delicious foods (which I'd be willing to wait for. It's worth it).
Positive	"We miss this guy!  As a former athlete, I've had my share and more of friggin injuries. I've traveled the country in search of competent folks in all disciplines of healing, to help keep me on my feet.  It's no secret that there are a lot of posers out there.  But not Matt, he is the real deal.  A genuinely good and honest human who truly cares about his work.  

Matt has a strong background in massage therapy that he has complimented with extensive study in Eastern medicine and philosophy.  For me, this combination proved to be magical.  Through consistent treatment, Matt was able to undo the years of damage that I had done to my body and actually get me competing again.  Friends of mine all had similar experiences with Matt, causing him to quickly become the ""go to"" guy in our area.  

We were all sad when Matt decided to relocate to the Midwest. You scored, Madison WI."
Positive	Just because your in Vegas does not mean you have to eat at a buffet! I love finding local fav's, and while this is off the beaten path for most tourists its totally worth it. I mostly eat vegan/ vegetarian food so thanks to the wonderful yelp i did a search and found the Red Velvet Cafe! Anything can be made vegan or vegetarian and for meat eaters you have plenty of options as well! Food= amazing... and sweets... well its in the title! WONDERFUL! Next time im in Vegas I will make a stop here once again thats for sure.
Positive	"Went here by myself for lunch to ""try it out"" I am a bbq lover BUT I saw they had a chicken breast w/ gravy and mashed potatoes and could not pass it up.
It was AMAZING I was so full I did not eat the veggies..well who needs veggies when you have those amazing biscuits w/apple butter..
To bad it is so far away from where I live I can't go as often as I want to but next chance I get I WILL be there.."
Positive	I gave this place a 4 star review because there are more pros than cons. The service was great and they brought the food out fast. The soup we ordered was really amazing. Very tasty. We both ordered the rare beef rice noodle soup. We also ordered egg rolls and those were really good as well. The restaurant is small. Definitely a hole in the wall type of place. It doesn't look so clean inside but as long as there are no health violations I'm fine with it!
Positive	Joey is great! Lost our car keys at Club Tao and had no luck in finding them. He came to our hotel/casino in an adequate amount of time and was very friendly and helpful! I would recommend this locksmith to ANYONE! He really saved us in our time of need!
Positive	Nice guys (even if they like the Yankees there...!).  Good haircut, reasonable prices, nice added perks above and beyond the haircut itself.  I would recommend (and already did) recommend to friends.
Positive	"Publix is my new favorite grocery store simply because of the amazing customer service! When I ordered a cake from there a few weeks ago, one of the clerks offered to hold it and follow me around the store to grab a few more items so I wouldn't have to hold it (the cake was amazing btw). When it was time to check-out several people greeted me and I didn't have to wait in line!

Fast forward to today and the customer service was exceptional. I didn't know where the Velveeta was (this literally happens every time I go to a new grocery store) and one of the employees gladly walked to me to the exact location and then asked if I need help looking for anything else on the list. The clerk offered to take my groceries to the car but I declined. The store has a super large selection of fruits/vegetables and the prices aren't too bad especially for the Publix brand. They do a few weird things like in the chip aisle there are barely any prices labeled which is a little annoying but the cool thing is they do a lot of BOGO free items and you don't need to sign up for a card or anything the discounts are applied automatically.

All in all--I will definitely do more grocery shopping here!"
Positive	"I was wandering around State street and found this little homey restaurant. It has a super casual feel and is family run, which is always a plus in my opinion. I had the Panang Curry which was great. Not too spicy and not too oily. A good ratio of meat to veggies. You definitely get all the flavors of the ingredients they use; Nothing is lost. 

I did take out on a Monday night and it was very quick. Would definitely recommend this place to friends."
Positive	This place was so much fun! We can here for a friend's birthday and had such a fun time! Seong and Jay were super helpful explaining how the karaoke room worked and was super fast with getting our drinks. We also tried the strawberry sujo, which was delicious! Def coming back next time we are in Vegas!
Positive	"Decided to try out the new Carnitas Mexican that opened in Stevens Mill since it's two minutes from our house. We had good service, our waitress was really nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Food is authentic, not your mexican-american joint. I was happy to see a few dishes here that I had in Mexico.  

Overall, I would go back, the food was good, the service was good, and the prices weren't bad! 

Only downside it the beans could have been warmer."
Positive	I love this place-- hands down the best pho in Vegas. The broth is delicious, smooth, and perfectly season and salted. This is my go-to place for pho. The service is exceptional and I have never had a bad experience here. I recommend  it to everyone who is looking for pho.
Positive	My friend and I were staying at the Stratosphere, while exploring we saw the lounge and wanted to just take pics. The view was absolutely breathtaking. Service was amazing. We met Dj Deze and she was amazing !! She was absolutely the reason we ended up staying for hours. We left at 4 in the morning. I had a great time ! Anyone in the area check this place out. It will not disappoint.
Positive	"Best  grilled salmon salad in the burgh! With a price tag of less than $10.00

 Even better then what you would pay twice as much for in fancier resturants. 

 I like to think of myself as some what of a salmon salad connoisseur lol

But really I have gone to places where the size of the salmon is more of a small nugget than a fillet of fish. 

I always order the grilled salmon salad here and the only time I am dissappointed is when they are sold out. 

They grill the salmon with skin on it's so flavor and a little charred in the best way.

I always have mine made with extra feta cheese. Zorba's does salmon right. 

The resturant is bright and light and fun to hang out at for lunch."
Positive	Absolutely wonderful! I got the ultimate surf and turf with a a couple of friends and it was divine! Vince was very knowledgeable and friendly. I will be sure to go there again and suggest to anyone.
Positive	"What I love most about this place is the owners commitment to truly awesome flavors. I had a coffee flavor I was so so on, and I kid you not, he didn't rest until it was the absolute best coffee custard I had ever had. You can not get that just anywhere! Love the flavors here, Banana is an all time favorite for me. My primary addiction at Glen's is the Cherry/blueberry slushie with custard. It's pure sugary, heavenly goodness. 
   At Glen's they are generous with the samples, don't be afraid to try them until you find the one that makes your heart sing. They've got it, I'm telling you. Go for the friendly staff and the cheery decor, stay because it's delicious. You'll be back when your taste buds insist on a custard fix that only Glen's in Tempe can satisfy."
Positive	Me and my co-workers always get the best service.  They have no problem with us faxing in an order and the food is ready when we arrive.  The food is excellent.  I love the cripsy texture of the wings, and the boneless strips are GREAT also.  On one of our visits, they gave us a ton of free food to sample all the new items on the menu.  I highly recommend this place.  BTW, the RANCH is the best!!!!
Positive	This was my fourth time at mezzo and the food was wonderful as usual. They have a great wine list and there specials are always very good. Love this place I recommend it to all my friends !
Positive	"I noticed that this place popped up a couple weeks ago when I was running errands at the surrounding stores and made a note to check it out so when my coworker asked to grab dinner we both realized that we had been wanting to give this place a try. Now I had never been to a Scaddabush location before but I was pleasantly surprised.

The day was beautiful so we decided to sit on the patio under the leafy canopy. The decor is so cute, totally my style with mismatched furniture and a rustic aesthetic. Our server was amazing! She was genuine and cheerful and looked like she actually enjoyed her job. She was also very knowledgable about the menu, giving us a rundown of specs and some of the favourites. 

I had a peach bellini to start and it was tasty! It was nice and slushy and not overpowering, perfect for post-work drinks. As an appetizer we got the Zucchini Fritti which was absolutely amazing. Contrary to most places that offer app's that are on the smaller size, there is none of that here. We got six huge fried zucchini pieces with a large tub of tomato sauce to dip. This would be amazing for larger parties as it feeds quite a bit and is also extremely filling. 

For my main I ordered the Pesto Pollo Fettuccine as the waitress mentioned that they make their pasta fresh daily and I was not let down! The sauce was the perfect ratio of creamy to pesto, allowing it to not be too heavy either. Although be warned that the portion sizes are HUGE and when contemplating between the ""small"" versus ""regular"" portions think with your head and not your stomach! If you want to share amongst friends however I'd recommend the ""regular"" size. 

I would definitely come back again and hope to soon. Maybe next time I'll take a seat in the main dining hall as the decor and vibe looked wonderful there as well. Overall it was an amazing experience, from the food to the service!"
Positive	Went to Icon with  6 others and tried all kinds of things.  From scallops to flatbread, to short ribs.  Everything was good, if not great.  Pitchers of peach & mango sangria to go around the table.  The short ribs were falling off the bone.  The chocolate mousse and the fried banana were an awesome end.  We ate and drank our fill, and when split amongst 7 people, I couldn't believe the bill was actually lower than I'd anticipated.  Will definitely return.
Positive	I had a great experience! The recliners are worth the price and the theatres are amazing. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star is when i asked for a water cup they gave me one with no ice. I'm not a golden retriever and I'm not a heathen. I'll definitely be back but with my own water.
Positive	Just stayed here for 3 days, we were offered a chance to upgrade to a suite for a moderate price. The room was everything and more, no complaints. The spa pool was something we enjoyed every morning. The buffet was priced fair, but nothing special. We really enjoyed the food court choices and the food was good. Great location for shopping and relaxing. The only let down and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the casino. The machines took our money for three days with little or no fun. Bingo was great, very nice people, the staff was great, especially Sergeo. I would stay here again and recommend it to friends.
Positive	"Picture yourself in a show in Las Vegas
With plastic cups with mind numbing liquors
Suddenly someone tells you to take your seats
A worker with kaleidoscope eyes

It goes without saying, but psychedelics are almost irrelevant in a Cirque Du Soleil show, when at any given point you'll wonder if you have to toss away your sobriety chip due to the general mind altering wonder and awe of a show like this. With that said;

For the benefit of Vegas patrons there will be a show tonight on trampoline... zip-lines. crazy yellow submarines and a lot of other trippy high flying craziness. 

Hey dude, don't think the show's bad. 
take a bad loss at the tables and make it better
remember, to not bet the farm at blackjack
then you can start to enjoy your Vegas trip

Jesus! The show was filling me with waves as if I had taken a saltshaker half-full of cocaine. Flying limey folk dressed to the era of the 70's twirling around in the air.  I found myself in times of trouble, where the fuck were you Mother Mary? And where the hell were my words of wisdom -- I learned to Let it be.. Oh let it be. 

Hey dude, don't be afraid. 
You are here to watch a music show 
The minute you let it wash over you 
Then you can begin... to have a blast. 

Once you embrace this freak show for what it is, the rest comes easy -- Just let this baby drive your car, then you're going to be a star. In a sense you'll Get back to where you once belonged. 

Just turn off your mind, relax and go down stream. The show's not dying.. The show is not dying...  It's something in the way the dancers move. I don't want to leave this show now.. I don't even know how -- I guess the exit signs. 

But yeah, you won't need any Lucy in the sky with diamonds before coming to the show. It provides enough of an mind fucking of uppers and downers in itself. 

With all those terrible Beatles song puns laced...okay, making up the entire review, I guess you can easily see that this show, if you're not one of those Elvis folks, will blow you away. 

It's a visual, audio and all sensory overload of spectacularness. Forget the Octopuses garden, I'd like to be watching this show a couple more times. 

As Sgt. Pepper lonely heart club band said, I hope you enjoyed the show, but hey, they're sorry but it's time to go. What next? 

Let me take you down to the Beatles Revolution lounge... Strawberry drinks, nothing is cheap. And nothing to write home about there. Better yet, let's just avoid the Beatles Revolution lounge bar altogether unless you really want an overpriced drink with a Beatles name attached to it. You're in a Casino, after all, drinks should be plentiful and comped. 

Go to the show, but forget The Beatles themed bar as a means to kill time before the show."
Positive	"Our Aunt E introduced us to WPM years ago and it remains one of the must do stops when we come home to Cleveland.
There's always something wonderful waiting to be discovered-fantastic gift items,  specialty foods, hard to find ingredients.
 We always plan our stop around mealtime: browse, sample, eat, shop-load the car up & eat again on the way back home.
Wish WE had one in California."
Positive	"Cute idea for a board game cafe! Definitely a clean and well-organized space with lots of seating, it's a nice place for a large group of friends. As well, a huge abundance of board games to choose from to play, and to potentially purchase from their little store selection! However, there is an $8 flat rate for each person as a ""sitting fee"". If you plan to stay a while, it is definitley good value. Nice ambiance, not too loud, with waiters constantly coming to check up on us!"
Positive	The cupcakes we had were delicious! We tried red velvet, strawberry, and dark chocolate - all were well worth it. Better yet, the customer service was top notch. The staff were very pleasant, assisted us with our decisions as there were plenty of choices, and they definitely went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. If you happen to be current or former military, they also show their support with Veterans Day deals which is much appreciated. We will be back for more!
Positive	"Best gun store in the West Valley.  Went in today and got a great deal on a LE Trade in Glock 22.  Cant beat it.  Jay's customer service is the best around.  While I was there waiting the background check he dealt with multiple customers in a very friendly and welcoming manner. Helping them determine what best suits their needs.  He didn't even sell them a thing, but rather told them where to go to try out pistols before they bought them.  

Chambered, where to go to buy a bit of American Freedom."
Positive	"Do you hesitate going to a dentist? So did I until I found Arizona Biltmore Dentistry and Dr. J and his really caring and professional staff. They care in the way you would dream of having dental work done.

For example, from routine cleaning to implants, the dentists and support staff put you at ease, tell really good jokes, ask you about yourself, ---all before any work is done. They also check with you often during their work to ask if you want a break or does anything at all feel uncomfortable.

I think you need to do yourself a favor and make an appointment so you can finally get that dental work done and also meet Dr.J, Dr. Mooney, Tiana, Jessica and all the others who laugh, smile, tell jokes, explain everything and make sure that when you are through, you will walk out their door with a smile and some fond memories.

The number one goal in this dental office is to listen to the patient and then agree to do your particular work according to your reasonable terms. If you want to divide the appointment into two different dates, they will gladly do so. If you even had one tooth pulled in your appointment, you will get a personal phone call that evening from your dentist to just check in. 

In all the years I have been a patient there and had surgeries, there has never been a problem or a nagging pain. I love my teeth; so do all the great pros at Arizona Biltmore Dentistry.

By the way, lots of good parking, coffee and bottled water and CURRENT magazines in the lobby."
Positive	"My husband and I like Central Diner for breakfast.  Him:  bagel all the way (lox, cream cheese, onion, capers, etc.).  Me:  eggs over easy with ham, home fries and English muffin.  It is usually always good but every so often the home fries taste ""old"" and the English muffin isn't toasted enough.  Not the best bagel and lox he has eaten but good.  One time when something didn't taste right, manager took it off the bill.  Service is always good!"
Positive	We have used Scruffy to Fluffy twice a month for the last 7 months and love the service they provide. I get a confirmation text a couple days in advance and a text when they are their way day of.
Positive	Awesome service. Great vibe inside. Donny is really friendly and made me feel very comfortable.  I appreciate that.  Amazing price and exceptional service. His staff show a pride in their work.  He had me in and out in less then an hour. Thanks again Donny.
Positive	Frost gelato - my favorite frozen treat! I can't get enough of this place. They are always busy, but the service is always friendly and I never feel rushed sampling all the different flavors. I love that every time I go, they have at least 2-3 new choices. Honey is one of my favorite seasonal flavors (I really think they should make it a regular). Cheesecake and raspberry are also delicious! Just wish you could get two flavors in a small cup!
Positive	What a cute little hipster kind of place.  After seeing Misti's review for Emergency Arts, a pal and I went down to check it out.  It happened to be World Aids Day so there were tons of aids related artwork, quilts, and ornaments to look at.  Upstairs they even had a table filled with eats and pitchers of wine to sample.  People there were extremely friendly to a point I couldn't tell if they worked there, were an artist or just really enthusiastic fans of the place.  A young gentleman in the back on the first floor explained to us how it used to be a hospital and showed us the x-ray room.  It is now being re-purposed into a t-shirt shop.  Many of the shops were closed to us at the time so I'd gladly go back to explore some more.  Before we left we were treated to some live music and stopped at The Beat for some pretty awesome coffee.  I'm happy to have a cool place like this in my town.
Positive	"I visited BnD'z as part of my search for a good fast casual burger place that is within a reasonable distance of my house. I like Five Guys but it is a little too far to be convenient from where I live in the South Hills. I had put off going to BnD'z because despite its decent overall score the Yelp algorithm seems to frontload the bad reviews and those were scaring me away. I wish I had visited sooner.

The burgers are delicious, with awesome flame grilled flavor, and perfectly toasted brioche buns. The fresh cut fries are also great. They have a lot of toppings and options, though in both of my visits I got pretty standard burgers, cooked to medium with cheddar, the house mayo, lettuce, and ketchup. The service has been very good as well. Both times we visited it was pretty busy but the staff did their best to keep up while being friendly and helpful. 

I did have a couple small gripes which should be mentioned. The first is that the buns are just a little too large for the burgers, if they sliced off about 20% around the edges it would be perfect. The second is that on our first visit our fries were delivered to us overcooked, dry, and crunchy. We asked if we could get another batch and they quickly cooked us up another. On our second trip the fries were perfect the first time. 

Apart from these small issues the burgers are delicious, the staff is good, and the prices aren't bad for what you are getting. I will definitely be going again."
Positive	"Liked it.  Good central location and walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel.
The food was very tasty and the food items for your selection are numerous.  That said make sure that you know what kind of sauces to use since it can make the whole difference.  There's is a sign on top of the sauces with recommendations so pay attention.  I followed the post ""popular"" choice which was great but a bit on the salty side.  The dinner is all you can eat while the lunch is not.  Nice interior.  Will go back"
Positive	"Having successfully managed to take down almost everything on my rather long list (aka I had nothing) of ""move must haves"" in the matter of 48 hours, the fact that I couldn't find just the right desk/vanity chair was starting to irk me.  So much so I had declared myself officially on the hunt. By the next weekend, I had tried a few more of the regular spots and still hadn't found anything that really blew up my skirt.  Refusing to be defeated or pay outrageous sums of money (I wasn't that frustrated quite yet) I busted out Yelp and did a search for consignment stores while I was out and about.  Enter Avery Lane.

It was easy enough to find off Greenway and parking was a breeze.  I walked in with high hopes, and was immediately deflated.  Everything was sooooooo well set out and displayed I figured it had to be one of thoooseee places.  You know, the type where the proprietor won't talk to you unless you are spending thousands of dollars, not to mention everything in there is a)breakable b)out of your price range and b)you know it.  Instant regret, but desire to not give myself away, forced me to make a cursory tour of the place where I was doing my best to not trip.

Well, well, well.  I got it wrong.  Yes, there place is filled with pricey items.  Yes, a lot of them are more Tuscan/desert/modern than my personal taste, and yes it is totally the type of place I would take my stylish aunt & interior designer cousin to impress them.  But as it turns out, Avery Lane has a lot more variety than first glance would indicate, and that goes for price as well.  Not only did I find the chair of my dreams, but I ended up with a fantastic decco set of lamps, beveled glass, and little french dressing room painting.  Let us not forget to mention, not only was the proprietor the opposite of elitist she was also very willing to bargain without making me feel like a fishwife from market ruining high tea or somesuch.  The Lane (as I now like to call it since it did me a good turn) is a gem for both the highbrow consumer and the champagne taste but beer budget crowd without offending either demographic. 

I would recommend this store to anyone looking for that special piece, or to avoid the cookie cutter options here abouts.  Take your time, do multiple sweeps... you will start to see more and more.  And by all means, don't hesitate to ask questions; the staff was not only helpful but genuinely friendly as well."
Positive	Rosalinda was excellent and very efficient!!! The service was immediate and very detailed... I can say that my experience here was a great one and I look forward in doing more business....
Positive	What an awesome place! I was taken here for my birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was great, the food was to die for, the fancy drinks were yummy and the 80's music was rad. Their selection of fresh seafood was plentiful and high quality. I cannot wait to go back again.
Positive	Been to a ton of cigar lounges. It just doesn't get any better here in the valley. Fully and I mean FULLY stocked humidor with all of the classics and the latest premium boutique cigars on the market. Love the craft brews and the massive wall of spirits. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable. Fox has set the bar at a new level.
Positive	When it's 11PM in Mississauga on a Sunday night I usually get stuck stopping at either Pizza Nova or Pizza Pizza, which isn't a terrible thing, but sometimes it's just not what I want. Luckily, I stumbled across the Burger Factory and it has officially changed everything! When I came in the place had a group of people and it took the employee a few minutes to acknowledge me, but hey, she was alone and she had burgers to make so I ain't mad. I ended up ordering a cheeseburger with onions, ketchup, tomato, and lettuce. I expected a pretty basic bland burger but what I got was an absolutely delicious, scrumptious, and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad I didn't get a second for the next day! This place is a little more expensive then some of the other fast burger places, but it's also a better quality burger. This place definitely far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back again to try a different style of burger!
Positive	"My team of Pablo and Pablo just finished up.  They did a fantastic job !!!!
It looks so clean and fresh. 
They were very professional and communicated with me several times a day about any questions they had and listened closely to any concerns I had.
At walk through I noticed several areas that needed a little touch-up.
They fixed these promptly until I was completely satisfied!
I had to have them paint an area of trim a couple of times and they did so immediately and until I was satisfied.
The office staff was very good as well and sent me reminders about my dates for painting.
Would definitely highly recommend this company!"
Positive	La comida estaba  riquísima!!! Ordenamos un bistec empalizado yo y mi esposa con congris y platanito maduro, mis dos niños pollo enpanisado y pescado enpanisado y todo estuvo espectacular, no pudimos ninguno de los cuatro comernos toda la comida ya que nos hecharon tremendo plataso pero por eso nadie protesta lol la muchacha que nos atendió era cubana bien chevere And a Dodger Fan to booth lol  Go Dodgers!!! el servicio fue rapidísimo tambien. What else is there to say about this place other than Great Service served delicious food at a very affordable price they're simply the best. Gracias cocinan Riquisimo!!! Barriga llena corazón contento ...Next time I am in Phoenix for Spring training to watch my beloved Dodgers I'll be sure to stop by best Cuban Restaurant in Phoenix hands down!!!!
Positive	I have been going to Diamond Nails for the past year to have my nails done.  They are very professional and courteous at every visit.  I have been very happy with the treatments on my nails.
Positive	Took a group of 8 here this morning for brunch. Our server was great. I had my usual strawberry chicken salad and it was delicious! Others had breakfast items. We all left full and happy. Will definitely come back.
Positive	I got the best service and best prices that I got anywhere in the country!  Doug and Curt were amazing!!!  I learned things I never knew and would highly recommend them to one and all but especially women because they treat you like an intelligent human being and not like an idiot.  My only regret is not finding them sooner as I would have saved a lot of money and received better service and products.  I'd like to give then TEN stars!!!!
Positive	"My wife took me here after a long day at work, staff was so friendly and welcoming, loved the idea of choosing my own toppings and kind of dough.
Pro tip: get 2 sauces on your pizza, marinara in the center, garlic and basil on the crust."
Positive	Honestly the Best Shop In Vegas. I'm From Cali, And I've Gone To Several Shops And This Is The Only one I've Come Back To. The Wax Is Amazing! and The Staff, Super Friendly. Highly Recommended.
Positive	I had a very good experience.  It was worth the 50 minute wait.  Our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating.  The food was very tasteful and portions were enough.  We started with Spanish Sangria which was very refreshing and had a good balance of fruits.  We ordered 3 Tapas:  Octopus, ham croquettes and Spanish Chorizo.  They all were excellent.  Our main dish was the Zarzuela de Mariscos.  This is a one person portion, but after starting with 3 Tapas it was enough for my wife and I.  We ended with a Tres Leches dessert.  It was delicious.  Not too sweet.  The right balance of sweetness.  A great finish to our dinner.
Positive	This pizza is humongous and just absolutely the best! I love this pizza joint! I can't wait to try the giant calzone next. The people who work here are incredibly nice! I recommend coming here!
Positive	"Will miss this place. Our last hurrah was a Saturday at the bar with a view into the kitchen, which was fun. Also, it was very cool that the man himself chatted with us for a few minutes. Since this was our swan song I tried to document every bite. My descriptions are simplified & do not reflect the true finesse of each bite:
1. Gazpacho, leek oil 
2. White watermelon, goat cheese mousse, wasabi oil
3. House ham, house biscuit 
4. Fried okra
5. Salmon, shaved avocado, olives
6. Foie gras stuffed cherries
7. Soft shell crab, bed of cabbage, watercress 
8. Morel mushroom, farm fresh egg, crouton, frothed parmesan cheese
9. Apricot bomb, anis broth
10. Scallops, sea beans, anis, cherry tomato, tomato water
11. Mini-Sloppy joe
12. Creamed summer corn, bacon, onion 
13. Squash blossom, chicken reduction sauce 
14. Cucumber & kaffir lime soda
 15. Wagyu beef, charred broccoli 
16. Grapefruit vinaigrette, crispy chard, prosciutto 
17. Grilled peach consumme, oak smoke
18. Lemon cream, toasted meringue, strawberries 
19. Chocolate mousse"
Positive	Used Yelp to find a good place for lunch. This place was fabulous. Patio is wonderful. The panini, salad and soup were all very tasty. Service was also really great. Music was a little too loud for Sunday afternoon.
Positive	"Thanks to Yelpers, we went on a tour last weekend.  The owners say they do very little advertising, most of their business is from word of mouth.  I've lived in LV for 8 years and never heard of the tour before stumbling across it while looking for something unique to do with my friend for her birthday.  
Our party (two couples) was joined by a third couple and a party of three girls (so 9 total in our group).  My hubby was dragging his feet about going but by the time we got to the first stop, he was literally running off the bus to find clues, hahaha.  Seriously THE most most fun we've had in a long time.  The only bummer is that they only change the ""mystery"" once a year so once you've gone, you have to wait a whole year to go again!!  But we can understand why, there is just so much that goes in to planning the tour.  
Our driver, Max, recommended coming for our second tour in October or November (the tour changes each year in September but it takes a little while to tweak it and work out the kinks).  The website says it is PG-13 and not recommended for children under 13 - I would concur, leave the kiddies at home for this one.  That's all I can say, don't want to give anything away!! 
I highly recommend Mystery Adventure Tours!"
Positive	I found this little place on my business trip to Phoenix last week. It was amazing and I stopped by twice!  Drinks were top notch and the food fabulous from the salad through dessert. I recommend trying this joint!  I'll definitely stop again if I find myself back in Phoenix.
Positive	The people there are fantastic! They are always super helpful and really friendly. The burgers are as good as the people that work there too! The burgers are always fresh and juicy and the fries are crisp and toasty. However, the shakes are nasty and probably shouldn't be consumed ever. Other than that, fantastic restaurant and I love going there.
Positive	"Nanette is AMAZING!!! She takes such good care of my kitties, she feeds and plays with them and cleans their litter box. She texts me pictures and notes every day to let me know how they're doing. 

It's so nice knowing when I have to leave that someone I trust is coming to check on my babies and my house! 

Last time she was here she even put my recycling out for me!!!"
Positive	Bee does a great job! Been going to her for years to get my eyebrows done. The shape is always perfect! Great place, wouldn't go anywhere else!  She offers other great services as well!
Positive	This was our first time here! We loved it and would definitely come back. Everyone was very helpful and had great customer service. Especially a guy named Tyler! He was awesome with his recommendations and service! It just sucks they can't accept tips and don't even have a tip jar! They need one! Thanks for the great meal Shake Shack!
Positive	"Came here for lunch on a Monday (which happens to be the day when ALL rolls are 1/2 off) and it was yummy!

We split a couple spicy tuna rolls that were really good. I liked that they were actually spicy! I've been to some sushi places where you can't tell the difference between the regular & spicy rolls. We also had the sunshine roll. The lemon complimented the salmon nicely. Very refreshing! In addition we had the jalepeno yellowtail roll. The jalepeno wasn't over-powering and went really well with the fish. My favorite though was the Da Bomb. I liked the fresh eel & tempura combination. In fact, I really liked that the fish tasted fresh with all the rolls we tried.   

We also had a seaweed salad & edamame. Both were delicious.

Jaime was our server and she was excellent. She was very attentive & really knew the menu (which isn't easy at a sushi place w/many specialty rolls).

Rock Lobster also looks like it has an excellent Happy Hour that I want to go to. I'll be back when I'm in this area again!"
Positive	Researched several other property management companies in the area. Found HomeQwik had the highest rating. Good reason for that. Very professional company with great staff. Purchased a home through Noel and am having him manage it. Transaction went smoothly and I was always kept informed of the status of the sale. All concerns/questions are always quickly answered and resolved. 5 stars all the way around.
Positive	"I love Kohls! I love the jewelry and purse sections the most! I always treat myself and buy new purse every couple months and they have a nice selection.  i'm always able to find cute socks and tights too. The close area.. juniors in women's section there's always a ton of small sizes xs and s and not enough of the other sizes. I can get lost in the jewelry section easily.. pricing there's not always cheap you have to either have coupons or really get a good deal. Although I did find a cute pair of black skinny jeans that a good price today.  I was hoping to find boot cut but the selection was slim.

Kohls please allow some A/C in your fitting rooms."
Positive	Been to Lichfield Auto Repair a few times now and thy never fail to give a fair quote and they're super quick! Most recent job even came in $100 cheaper than what I was quoted!
Positive	"Lemon Lust Cupcakes. All you will ever need.

Michael Angelo's is found on the East side of Broadview Road almost centered between Sprague and Wallings. It's a cute little building that looks like it should have a bakery in it. And what a gem of a bakery - with an amazing variety of baked goods, and and amazing variety of flavors of cakes, cupcakes and cookies, every wall and flat surface has something absolutely delicious on it.  I stopped in to buy Cupcakes for a birthday celebration and I was pleasantly shocked at the low price for really big and delicious cupcakes in an assortment of flavors. I highly recommend alternating bites of Lemon Lust and Chocolate Fudge cupcakes. So Good.

They have great capacity for event baking, so your wedding cake needs, dessert trays, everything for a small or large event can be done there. 

You will not be disappointed, everything but everything is good."
Positive	I think this place is great. It's a laundromat people! Gesh. The machines work great. The attendants are very nice and friendly.  I always see them sweeping and cleaning! They work their butts off to keep the place nice and clean. Great job ladies! My only recommendation: free wifi for the people in there. That would be cool. Sometimes I'm in there for hours washing clothes. Wifi would come in handy!
Positive	Blown away by the service at The Waggle Company! They are always so nice, and they make a somewhat stressful situation stress-free (say that five times fast ;) ).  I came to The Waggle Company from a colleague's recommendation after I had an awful experience with another local dog-walking company.  It is the best dog-walking company I've ever used! The Waggle Company not only sends you an e-mail upon arrival and departure from your home that includes a report card and pictures, but they also use GPS on their walks with your dog(s) so you can see the route taken.  Their online reservation system is easy to use, and the invoicing is seamless!  Highly recommend to anybody seeking a reliable dog walker.
Positive	"Third time eating at this buffet mecca this past 4th of July weekend. This buffet embodies the word massive (in food selection, gluttony, and flavor) so if you are only going to eat at one buffet in Vegas, this is the one to try.

Wait: They recently installed a kiosk system, giving you a time when your table will be ready. If you choose to go this route (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), it frees you up to go gamble, relax, or putting on loose fitting clothes. This new system erased my previous main gripe about this place - the lines.

Price: This is one of Vegas' most expensive buffets, so be prepared to pay $35/person for lunch and $45 for dinner ($50 on the weekends). For those doing the 24-hour Buffet of Buffets, it is a $15 charge per trip, per person to eat here. For best bang-for-your buck, aim for a 2 - 3 PM arrival, so you can catch some of the dinner foods at a lunch price. This place, as with most other Vegas buffets, will charge you extra on holidays and their corresponding weekends (Memorial, 4th of July, Labor, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years are the ones I remember them mentioning).

Food Highlights:
You really can't go wrong with anything here. This is a rarity for buffets, which I have found to be largely ""meh"" with a few sprinkled good dishes. It WILL take multiple trips and many hours to explore their vast selection. Here are my favorites:
- The Seafood section, which includes selections such as snow and steamed crabs, fresh oysters, and various seafood concoctions are a must try, as are the many selections at the carving station. Quality is much higher than those at other buffets.
- The TACO STATION is delicious! I love Mexican food and these were taco truck at 3 AM good!
- Your Asian and American foods are definitely a cut above others in terms of quality. I did find some of the foods to be on the salty side, however.
- The fresh squeezed juices (I believe 5 different kinds) are unique to this buffet. We came on a Sunday, so we were also able to take advantage of mimosas at no extra charge.
- The desserts here are the best in Vegas, no comparison. Tiramisu, creme brulee, macarons, and mochi ice cream are some of the more gourmet desserts that make this the highlight station.

Overall:  This buffet's selection and quality is definitely a cut above the others that I have recently tried. The dessert station here itself is worth the price of admission and makes this place worth checking out. I'm not sure if it's worth the holiday pricing, but it is worth the regular prices or the $15 Buffet of Buffets add-on. If you only have the time, budget, or stomach space for one buffet, make it Bacchanal, the God of Buffets."
Positive	So every here and there, you just want a solid chicken wing without paying true restaurant pricing.  I have to say that the Lemon Pepper wings (bone in) at Wingstop are among the best chicken wings I've had whether in a restaurant or not.  Their dressings and dipping sauces are also all top notch.  Preferably the blue cheese or the ranch, they're both killer.  Many locations all over town so t makes it easy and convenient to find a location near you!
Positive	"Everything was amazing! The potato & manchego flautas were crispy and flavorful, topped with a perfectly spicy salsa and guacamole. Hubby had two sopes, they were delicious. My daughter enjoyed the beans, (I had to do ""quality control"" and they were great!) and we all ate the corn in a cup, which I HIGHLY recommend. The ambiance is so fun, too! We'll be back :)"
Positive	"Update! 
I have been to Watson's twice since my initial visit and boy have things changed. This place is easily one of the highlights of downtown Champaign, and my new favorite place to get chicken.
Staff were knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. I asked for some recommendations and they were quick to point out some of the customer favorites.
I, of course, am partial to their wings and their chicken sandwich, but their regular chicken is amazing as well. I've had both their fried and spit-fire roasted chicken and both are incredible.
Well done Watson's, you've exceeded my expectations and I will be back soon!"
Positive	"I came to Ramen Sora on their grand opening day and both food and services were pretty good. Everyone from host to server was super friendly. Even though it was grand opening day, all the food we ordered came out quickly when this place was full house. I like shio ramen a little bit better than miso one. Ramen noodle tasted a little firm just in the way I like it to serve. Chef was pretty generous when serving ramen with chasu. (each bowl came with 3 pieces of chasu) I personally like their soup base a lot better than Monta. (Monta's soup base is too salty to me) I also tried their Gyoza. It was really good and worth the money. 

I will be back soon after they have alcohol license. I always like to eat ramen noodles with some Sapporo."
Positive	Friendly service and great place to get dinner and relax. I found it when staying at the nearby Hilton. The food is great and reasonably priced. I sat in main dining area they also have lounge like areas with couches.
Positive	"It was extremely cold tonight, so Jason B. and I wanted to eat something warm. So we decided to go back to Cherry Blossom for the second time, because we really enjoyed it the first time around.

The second go around confirmed it! This is a great restaurant!

We started with the Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot. Which consists of gyoza in an extremely spicy broth! That kind of spicy that makes you talk funny! But the combination of tasty gyoza and the spicy broth was absolutely scrumptious! 

For dinner I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, Iron Pot. A well flavored broth with seafood such as, calamari, fish, clams, scallops, and the wonderful thick Udon noddles! I like my Noodles thick! 

If you like Ramen, Sushi or other types of Noodles, CherryBlossom is a great choice, there is something for just about everyone."
Positive	The food and service was absolutely amazing! I'm from out of town so I was completely relying on Yelp reviews to find good food in the area. I immediately asked our waitress if their food was as good as the reviews said it was  She was awesome and told me it was and recommended some awesome stuff for us to try. For appetizers we had table side guacamole(which I ate the entire bowl, it was THAT good) and these AMAZING sweet plantains that were perfectly fried  I'm sad that I do not live here because I would eat there every single day just for those two things. Then I had the arroz con pollo, which was also amazing. I know that's a pretty standard menu item at most Mexican restaurants, but they definitely take theirs too a more elevated level. Definitely try this place whether you live here or if you're just passing through like I was
Positive	I stayed at the Monte Carlo during EDC weekend 2013 for 5 nights. I've come to Vegas many times and have always encountered a problem at some point during my stay. The Monte Carlo did NOT follow the trend. We arrived at the resort around 9:30am, however check-in isn't til' 3pm. Not a problem, the front desk employee not only allowed us to check-in early but she gave a us a good room overlooking the pool. The lazy river and the wave pool were really enjoyable especially with a DJ spinnin' house music as you swim and drink. The casino, pool, front lobby, parking lot and dinning areas are all relatively close to each other which is great if you dont like having to walk a mile to get from one place to another. 4 stars instead of 5 because our bathtub and sink kept clogging even after we asked someone to service it. The innertubes should be free if you're a guest at the hotel. $5 a tube isn't really worth it. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were tidy. Everything was clean for the most part. EDC is a busy time but Monte Carlo made it comfortable and relaxing.
Positive	Everything was sooooo delicious!! The best buffet hands down. The customer service was so good, I forgot that I was in a self serve buffet. More like a 5 star restaurant!
Positive	"Club Isabella, somewhat mysterious. Despite its name, it's not a club. Despite its Little Italy location, it's not an Italian restaurant. And, for these reasons, I am quite pleased.

Imagine a spacious and gorgeously modern atmosphere with music lightly playing on a baby grand piano. Eclectic and creative menu items like the steam buns and tartar trio sampler, difficult to resist.  Dynamic and impressive cocktails like the Bulleit Manhattan and Juniper Elderflower, just divine.

The perfect place for post-work drinks or late night eats and especially convenient while in the neighborhood for a Murray Hill art walk, concert at Severance Hall, event at the CMA or MOCA, etc. etc.

Gentlemen, take note: this would be a fine choice to wine and dine that special someone. 

Club Isabella is kind of like one of those best kept secrets that you don't necessarily want to share but would feel selfish doing so. It may not be so mysterious for much longer. . ."
Positive	"Was here for a few minutes with friends. We're all in our mid twenties. I'm currently pretending to know what I'm gonna do with my life, I think two others are in the same boat. But one of us recently got accepted into med school and another is a second year law student, so we grind. 

I wasn't interested in drinking that night. Asked the bartender for water and she assumed I was the DD and essentially thanked me for my service. I didn't get a chance to tell her I just didn't feel like drinking because she had patrons to attend to, but it was a pleasant experience. 

Usually at arcade bars I can expect the game cabinets to be sticky and malfunctioning. Wouldn't say that Bonus Round broke the trend, but most games worked and were clean. Arcade bars aren't really my thing so I can't promise that I'll go back. But if someone was to ask me for a recommendation I'd probably choose this place."
Positive	So far my favorite Sprint store in the area. Just bought a new phone and all my accessories from here. The representative, Matt, was very helpful and even helped me score some great deals. I will definitely come back again for my next phone.
Positive	After reading the reviews, I was a bit skeptical to take my 9-month pregnant wife here, especially since we are self proclaimed foodies and have eaten at most of the top rated Italian locales. We were super happy with the restaurant and we were both very pleasantly surprised. The ambiance, food, service, price, everything was great. We'd highly recommend it. Our waiter was Guillermo......he was awesome.  We can't wait to go back!
Positive	Just sat down enjoying a really great cup of joe. As my first time here, i am enjoying the decor American Pride. I feel at home. Service is top notch. The food is amazing.
Positive	"Wow! Ça sent trop bon dans ce restaurant. Cuisine authentique Indienne dans le quartier Parc-extension, il s'agit d'un des plus populaires avec un important achalandage. Beaucoup de place disponible pour accueillir des groupes également : c'est toutefois bruyant et ce n'est probablement pas une place pour date romantique à la chandelle. N'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un BYOW.

Pour la bouffe... succulent! Chaque plat est très goûteux avec plusieurs épices. Le poulet au beurre est un classique à ne pas manquer. Que dire du fluffy pain Nan!

Je le recommande fortement à tous!"
Positive	From start to finish, this was one of the most exceptional meals we've had all year. The ingredients could not have been fresher and the preparation was nothing short of expert. The space is cozy but vibrant and loud, the wine list is thoughtfully curated, and the service attentive and very friendly. Though all of our food was amazing, the squid ink pasta with lobster sausage in a bisque was out of this world. We'd never had anything like it. Get ready for a treat if you're lucky enough to snag a table!
Positive	"Late lunch, began with pumpkin bisque, served hot with wonderful chewy bread on a cold rainy day paired well with Fuzelo Vinho Verde, a crisp house Portuguese white at 11%. Bar service was prompt and attentive.

After a leisurely passage of time in the old -world South side Pitts ambiance, the tapas and another glass were presented: Pulpo a la Gallega (potatoes and octopus) and, Piquillos Rellenos (peppers stuffed with raisins and nuts). Hey, I wanted to try something different: which leads me to my only ""issue."" Although the dishes were expertly prepared and wonderful (although this was my last attempt at trying to like octopus), I would have liked to have tried more: seafood stuffed mushrooms, pickled anchovies, etc. but the portion was huge! I was lucky to finish the two tapas I ordered! tapas in Spain are sold one at a time, the idea being to try a variety, not stuff yourself with just a couple! Maybe things are different in Portugal...

Regardless, I could not refuse Flan, which came with a nice scoop of caramel on the side. Very well done!"
Positive	"The restaurant has a very nice ambience and sleek washrooms.

The food is delicious - and the prices are also very similar yet it feels you get food that tastes better than a Joeys or Earls.

The desert menus has made in house that is highly recommend - these are not bought frozen and then resold.

The staff is also attentive."
Positive	"Quick and easy restaurant. The menu is on the wall and you order before you sit. The smell is great and I was pretty excited. 

I concur with some of the other reviews that it is a bit pricey for lunch, but they do have a specials menu. I'll have to check that out next time. 

Anyway, the masaman curry with beef and potatoes was very good and quite a decent sized portion. 

Overall worth a shot if you're in the Madison burbs."
Positive	"Kona is the best!!! The staff is friendly, happy and always helpful!!!! The ""Dana"" with black tea is my favorite, but their coffee is also delicious!! Their $10 punch card is an amazing deal!!! I am addicted and will never go back to Starbucks!!! Give Kona a try, you won't be disappointed!!! Aloha!!!"
Positive	Definitely a great pizzeria, thin crust pizza with a greasy top! We tried the pork reigns and definitely recommend it. The only downside, if any, is they make everything fresh so be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes for your pizza.
Positive	I have been back a couple of times since my frist review and every time it is great! Everyone who works there is kind and shows great customer service. The coffee and pie are delicious. We had breakfast there at our last visit and their jalapeno cheddar biscuit is so yummy. We tried it both ways and I loved them both!
Positive	Food at the cafe is so good an very affordable.  Who needs expensive Vegas strip hotel buffet when you can eat delicious food here for much less?  It's only 10 minutes walk from the strip.  I had Pasta with marinara sauce and meat balls for $7.99.  It had 3 huge fresh juicy meatballs.  It was the best meatballs ever.  Then I had the Prime Rib for $13.99 which comes with a glass of house brewed draft beer.  The prime rib was so delicious.  It's fresh made everyday, juicy and tender.  I couldn't finish my 12oz prime rib and took back to hotel for the next day breakfast because I had a fridge in my room.  Mashed potato was delicious too.  I could've eaten here everyday and saved  a lot of money.  Highly recommended to everyone.  A lot of local repeaters here.
Positive	My husband and I are regulars that being said the food is always great, wanting to always trying something new. If there is ever an issue (which is next to never) they are extremely prompt on making it right. Oh and there beer!! It is out oft this world, between draft / bottle / can they can please any palate. Everyone is wonderful, but exceptional service comes from the bartenders. Aaron, Jamee, Emily ... you guys are great!
Positive	"The food, service, and the restaurant in general were all great! I ordered the stuffed shrimp along with the BLT iceberg salad. The salad was just the right size and had two of my favorite things: bleu cheese and bacon. ;)

The shrimp were fantastic as well. The crab tasted really fresh. I'd definitely come back the next time I am in Las Vegas."
Positive	"I came here during the summer with my younger brother because I wanted to check out the facilities. My first impression was how big the place was. Placed in the middle of the construction of new condos and old houses this brand new aquatic centre definitely stands out. At first when you walk to the main desk area you already feel the openness of the centre. There is a piano and I believe a room that wasn't occupied at all. The change rooms are HUGE and long. What is interesting about this centre is that the change rooms are unisex. I find it really awkward only because I've been conditioned to using a women's change room. But I guess this is revolutionary in a way to maximize the usage of space and allow more to enjoy the aquatic centre. I love that there's a slide, whirlpool, water falls, Tarzan swing and a diving board.  For those who have children there is a seperate area for younger children so that they aren't overwhelmed by the big children running around. There's music that plays that keeps the atmosphere lively. This centre also offers free class like aquafit! 

So if you're in the area and have free time definitely check this place out and enjoy it! 

-CL

PS the only problem about this aquatic centre is that it doesn't offer parking and that you'll have to find it on the side streets which might not be ideal."
Positive	The outside of the restaurant is not what brings you in. I'm glad we listened to the yelp reviews because the food was great. I had the Parisian omelet and it was great. The toast was cold and not very good. The potatoes were great too. My son had a waffle and he thought it was ok, a bit boring and wished it came with strawberries or some other topping. My girls had bacon and eggs and thought they were good. One had a banana nut muffin and the other had a peaches and cream muffin. They raved over their muffins and thought they were fantastic.
Positive	Dr. Marino is the best.  He goes above and beyond in each session to make sure you receive the best adjustment that you can.  He is not a chiropractor that gets you in and out in 5 minutes.  He actually cares about your well being and takes his time with each patient.  His prices are very reasonable for what you get.  The massages are great also and all of the staff is very nice.  Will not go anywhere else!
Positive	I went here while in the area for an event and they did a fantastic job. Very good attention to detail that I haven't had a salon in a long while. I got just the standard mani pedi but they constantly checked in that the shape and color were good, did a thorough job on my cuticles and we're very polite.
Positive	"I was in Vegas for the first time. I couldn't WAIT to get off the strip. I found this little gem by chance and decided to give it a try. We couldn't make a reservation but called on the way over to put our names on. We ordered drinks at the bar, and suddenly our table was ready. I loved my ""Get Shorty"" -- sort of a spicy margarita. We sat outside on the patio upstairs. It was warm, welcoming and wonderful. 

All of our food was delicious. Most memorable were the bacon jam (what?) and the veal meatballs. I'm Swedish, and I know a thing or two about meatballs. It was something in between Swedish meatballs and another Swedish dish called Wallenbergare. Pure delight. 

I loved the cool atmosphere, and such a diverse crowd.

Thanks so much. If I get to Vegas again I will be back!"
Positive	Ordered the Garden platter for take-out. First time trying this place and it was fantastic! The kofte was really flavourful and better then other places I've tried. The chicken kebob was nicely marinated and delicious. Also enjoyed the two types of rice in the platter. The platter was perfect for two very hungry people. I will definitely be going back!!
Positive	"I just had my very first Plato's Closet experience and I was highly impressed. I had read some reviews for Scottsdale and Chandler and was nervous to hear that so many shoppers had experienced such poor customer service, but Glendale didn't seem to have that rep. Sure enough the employees at this location were kind, attentive, helpful and overall friendly. 
The clothing selection was very diverse and reasonably priced. Better signage could help the organization of items but it wasn't too shabby overall.
As for selling my clothes there, I expected a little more profit but I wasn't too shocked about that. However, I was shocked that they didn't offer a higher amount in store credit. The local places at which I use to consign would typically offer you less in cash and more in store credit. I was pretty bummed about that aspect."
Positive	"Runner's Den, everyone said, when I started having problems standing at my PT retirement job after 20+ years at a desk. Runner's Den-you have to go there, they all said. 

What?? Runner's Den? C'mon, they'll look at me and instantly know that if I ran 10 feet I'd keel over dead, and they'll smirk at me. I'm old and woefully out of shape.

Nope. Positively great service, took my concerns seriously and really helped me find shoes to make the newest part of my life work. I mean, this last time, I think she tried over 10 pr. of shoes on me. They watch you walk in socks and in each pair of shoes to see what your foot is doing and listen, they know their stuff. But they don't preach or patronize, they just engage you in a helpful conversation about what's going on with your feet. They're not a bargain basement place, so you should know you'll spend some money, but to me, it's worth it to have feet that don't ache when I'm standing on concrete floors. 

Look, I'll never be a runner, but now, thanks to Runner's Den, I don't have sore feet!!"
Positive	Very good prices, super friendly salesman, and not pushy at all. Very happy leaving with a great car and great deal. Got everything done in a timely manner, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced car.
Positive	I Thought the donuts were excellent.  The place was clean and very friendly.  I will for sure go back. Since they are new hope everyone gives them a chance.
Positive	Tim and his team were recommended by our realtor. I have never worked with a more dedicated, efficient team.  I was able to reach Tim or his staff literally anytime the need arose.  They kept me advised throughout the entire process either by email or phone.  To be honest, I would never purchase another home without them at my side.  I recommend them highly to any buyer that needs to work with an incredible team.
Positive	"Le re've - the dream... A dream indeed.  

My husband set up this incredible evening with VIP seats.  They have plush seats that are at the top of the circular stage.  Waitresses come by for drink and snack orders.  There is also a small video screen by your feet to watch behind the scenes before and during the show.  Very interesting! 

As for the show, performers are so talented! The visual display of lighting and water are amazing.  It's not a cirque show so not as many acrobatics but it's still enjoyment! Compared to the other water show in Vegas, I'd probably choose le re've.  

In this beautiful theater, any seat is great.  We certainly enjoyed this amazing show!"
Positive	This was my first time at La Medeleine and the wait wasnt too long. The food very good. I liked the atmosphere. There was a bit of an issue with the order not all coming out at one time for both of us and the manager was more than kind regarding the issue and took care of it for us!
Positive	Here's what I love about this place (besides the bottomless mimosas, obviously): you can arrange a brunch for a large group of people without jumping through hoops. Whenever I've tried to book something similar at other restaurants, you have to pre-pay, you can't order from the regular menu, if one or two people cancel you need to pay a fee on their behalf, etc - I get that they don't want people to book huge tables and then not show up, but all the rules just make booking a headache. Not so here - the staff are super laid back and great at accommodating large groups. Both times I've been for brunch, Kevin has been our server and he's awesome - super friendly and attentive. For $32 you get a choice of brunch entree and bottomless mimosas with your choice of juice - orange, grapefruit, pineapple etc. If you have a big table they just bring bottles and all kinds of juice and you can mix and match. One star off just because the food isn't the greatest (it's not BAD, just not amazing) but for the price, it's good enough. In any case, I come for the mimosas!
Positive	"Love this place! The office staff was so friendly and welcoming. Everyone was smiling and it seems it me like s well oiled machine. 

I have an illness that makes me clench my teeth. 
Well I broke a couple in my sleep. Dr Quinn's staff got me in right away. Dr Quinn knew it was an emergency situation . Usually I get really nervous , but this office made me feel comfortable and secure. Dr Quinn fixed me up so that I am pain free now, and my "" bite"", is better. 
He also had a mouth guard made just for my mouth. It keeps me from clenching. 

Thank You Dr Quinn, I want to keep my teeth as long as possible. 
Thank you staff, for making me feel at ease.

Positive	"This is probably my favorite place to go to do 80% of my drinking in champaign. It's chill and out of the way but interesting people show up. 

The ownership knows what their doing as well as service is always quick to serve and quick to help. 

How awesome is it to feel a good party mood yet ALSO be able to talk to someone!?"
Positive	"We celebrated mother's day at Gina's bistro. The owner Ricciardo and his mom are from Italy and she is an amazing chef. They brought out home made bread right out of the oven for starters that was so moist and dense on the inside and crispy on the outside that you could easily eat it without any butter. It was absolutley sublime. We've never eaten bread this flavorful at any restauraunt in Las Vegas. The salads were amazing and fresh with a light creamy dressing on it.  

For entrees Dad had the arabiata spaghetti which he said was wonderful. Mom had the white lasagna which she said was excellent. My wife and I had the cioppino with clams, mussels, shrimp,scallops, and fish in a lightly spiced, garlic infused red broth. OMG out of this world! All cooked to perfection so the seafood just melted in your mouth. Dipping the home made bread into the cioppino took it to another level.

For dessert we shared the tortonii which was the best we've ever had. Mom had a canoli and loved it. Coffee was very good as well. Highly recommended."
Positive	Excellent food and five star service. Best ribs ever. Everything is fresh and portions are large. Warm croissants with house salad are a special touch. I have had mushrooms, fried okra, garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans... All superb. Atmosphere is warm with wood and brick walls, low lighting with table sconces. Your glass with never be empty. Well staffed means excellent customer service.
Positive	This place is the absolute best !!! My girlfriend and I always LOVE to stop in and grab a frozen fat cup! They are so tasty and the customer service is always awesome! Shout out to our friend Alex he always remembers us when we come in which means the world to us ! Great job fat straw keep up the good work !
Positive	"A diamond in the rough! 

We drove up Edmonton Trail, only to be astounded at the line ups outside of the diners we really wanted to try. We found this place on the fly!

It's absolutely a dive on the inside, but we were seated immediately, the service was prompt (I was starving by this point), food was cheaper than most, and it was delicious. The hash browns are seasoned well, eggs were perfect, and the Benny was delicious.

Only downside was the decor. We were seated in the back, which is painted flouro green, tacky decorations, but the food and service make up for it! We'll be back!"
Positive	Love this place! Great Thai food and amazing service. The wait wont be long if you come a bit early and show up with your full party, but the food and ambience is worth the wait.
Positive	"Solid 4 stars - actually one of the better AYCE places here in Vegas especially in Silverado Ranch/Seven Hills area. This place satisfied my sushi cravings. 

Waitress recommended to try their ""orange blossom"" and ""sex bomb"" rolls - they were actually very good ! They do half rolls here too which is always a plus. Salmon & salmon belly nigiri were delicious. Toro & uni nigiri were actually decent for being an AYCE place. Only thing I wish that was better  is their fish-to-rice ratio but at least the sushi tasted fresh.

Sashimi is limited to 3 orders per person I believe but it's more than enough so you have room for other things. I highly recommend their salmon sashimi as well as their yellowtail sashimi.

Other menu items I've enjoyed were their beef tataki (1 order per person) and soft shell crab. Unlimited dessert (honey toast , tiramisu , tempura cheesecake and your standard mochi & tempura ice cream are all available here). Only dessert that is not unlimited is the creme brulee which comes in green tea or vanilla.

Appreciated good customer service from all the waitresses here. Prices are 23$ lunch (til 4 pm) & 28$ dinner. Make sure to get their stamp card (11th one is free)."
Positive	"Hendersons hidden secret! Just had my birthday brunch. So happy!!! I couldnt ask for a better birthday. The service was awesome. The service was good. Food was tasty. I fe
lt like I was being catered to. I feel happy and thankful. This was the start to my incredible day and i have had the best day so far. A big thanks to the manager and our waitress for taking every step to ensure it was worth it. We will see you again for sure÷!!"
Positive	Very clean, friendly staff, great food, has kids playground.  It was busy but still had a excellent expeirence. As a side note (some people might not know this) you can trade in your unopened kids meal toys for ice-cream.  I believe all Chick-Fil-a do this.
Positive	My favorite sub place. They are all very tasty! Another thing I love about this place is that every employee is so nice. Never seen happier and politer people working. I go here at least 3 times a week and it's been great every time
Positive	"This local famous restaurant is a fun place to eat for lunch.  Everytime I come to Phoenix I have to complete my trip by eating there.  Their chinese-mexican mixed foods are tasty.  The line is always there but the foods are served fast.  I always want to try different combo but end up eating Emerald Chicken and Jerk Chicken because they are that yummy.

While you are there check out their chinese proverbs T-shirt."
Positive	A favorite new place.  Quiet, casual but good ambiance. The food is one of AZs best and few for Chinese.  Good portions and amazing flavors.  Price is very reasonable.
Positive	Love love this restaurant!! They have romantic setting, looks like a candle light feel. They also have a man come around and sing to you, my husband and I do love all of their pasta dishes and they do accommodate to any of your dietary needs
Positive	The BEST bacon burger ever.  First yelp review because this burger deserved a review. I was visiting Phoenix and was looking for an outdoor place to enjoy a delicious burger without being overpriced. Coach's was the answer. They chop up he bacon and cook it in the burger- AMAZING. Perfect burger. Great service. Great beer specials. Will definitely try and remake this burger at home.
Positive	"Finally the 5 star meal that I knew was coming. I have always thought that the waiters at Nicky's are professional and sweet. I get the feeling that they know they work at a good restaurant. 

The shrimp red chili just wasn't doing it for me and I eaten that dish close to five times.  It lacked that wow factor that so many other Yelpers had written about.  So on my last visit I had previously promised to myself I would change it up.  I went with the spicy fish basil, spicy number 7.  Talk about flavor.  Here I had found just what I wanted.  The spicy fish basil was one of the very  few Asian dishes I had ever eaten where the vegetables were every bit as good as the meat.  Finding the eggplant in the dish was like uncovering little treasures. Yes the fish was good but the veggies were also phenomenal.

The spicy fish basil has it all:  basil, eggplants, onions, shoots, tilapia and yellow bell peppers.  I am sure I'm leaving something out but this dish had it going on!  This was the first time I had ever experienced the herb basil used in a non Italian dish. I was blown away by the preparation .

 There was less sauce on the dish then I'm use to getting a Nicky's.  So I found myself having to tilt the plate and scrape sauce from the bottom to spoon over my rice. I would as for a little more sauce please.

I also would like to mention that dining here on Sunday night was my first time BYOBing .   I researched online what was considered ""B"" . I got a six pack of tall boys and brought them along as my dining companion.  It went over very well and BYOB is the way to go! 

 There are many  special touches around the restaurant too.  Here are just a few that stood out to me.  The golden chalice that the rice is served in.  The fresh yellow daisies on all the tables, and the gold flatwear and also I am so in love with the golden Buddhist deity statues everywhere it really makes the restaurant look opulent. I never gave up on Nicky's and I've found a dish that I love. Plus they have the best pork dumplings."
Positive	"I've been coming here for all of my tire related needs, and I've never had an issue. They always provide friendly and quality service.

If you've purchased tires from them then you receive free patch work in case you hit for instance a nail, you also receieve free tire rotations, balancing, and air checks.

The location is good too because there is a cafe close by and lunch options within the same plaza for while you wait."
Positive	"Part Deux to our Sunday Rendez-Vous:
We took the monorail between casinos to the The Shops at Crystals outside the ARIA Resort & Casino. No, not to shop, rather uncover a secret above the consumerist chaos. Traveling as though through the twilight zone, we time-warped out of the Louis Vuitton @ City Center, beyond all earthly placations into a hypnotic calm of sensory relaxation.

James Turrell Exhibit At Louis Vuitton is home to Akhob, a unique installation that creates a distinction between the overabundance of modern corporate consumerism & the distilled sophistication of prismatic light. The world & its walls appear to melt away as the primary colors move through gradiation from one intense extreme of the spectrum to soft, radiant rays. 

Egyptian for ""pure water"", Akhob is a sound chamber that produces the illusion of ganzfeld effect, an altered state of body, mind, and consciousness produced by gazing into an immersive color field. James Turrell's exhibition creates a sensation of detachment as though floating free of time, space, and material, as though absorbed within a transcendent meditative nature. Life and art stripped down to its core beauty, scientific principles, and quintessential character -- color."
Positive	This is always one of favorite places to eat when coming to Las Vegas. Very casual with great service & food. We started with the Barbados Holiday cocktail which was rum raspberry muddle & Ginger Honey-Outstanding! We had the Ahi bowl and the Miso Salmon bowl from their specials menu. Booth were great but the Ahi won out.  Pina Colada cake & Kona coffee to finish everything off!
Positive	I had never worked out before and was having trouble getting motivated. After meeting Tony and April, I was to become a person who regularly works out. Tony tailored my workout to My individual fitness goals and he and April are so kind and easy to talk to. The entire gym is warm and welcoming. Whether you are a gym rat or a newbie, you will never want to go to another gym once you go to Alpha Athletics. You workout, you can make new friends as well. They have cookouts and other social gatherings  for the gym. What a great place!
Positive	AMAZING! We could not believe that we had driven by this place so many times and never stopped here. From the outside we always assumed this was like a Pei Wei... not even close! This is a very nice little place, atmosphere is great, staff is great, food is awesome. We had the shaken beef, firecracker shrimp, and the garlic noodles. All of them were just awesome. We've definitely found our new favorite place.
Positive	We went based on a recommendation from a friend and were obviously first timers when we walked in because a staff member quickly flagged us down out of line and showed us the ropes. We were given an unlimited number of samples before deciding what to order. Decided on the #7, #8 and a #7 quesadilla. Oh my stars! Everything was so delicious! It wasn't your standard Mexican food nor was it your standard Chinese food, it was so good! Portion sizes were quite generous and every meal comes with a complimentary snickerdoodle cookie. So good! We will be back next time we are in the Phoenix area!
Positive	"The service here is amazing!


I am normally a Starbucks fan and was actually looking for one when I encountered Dutch Bros. I am glad that I decided to stop by. I was greeted by a friendly employee as I pulled into the drive through. She welcomed me warmly and asked if it was my first time at the shop. She even explained the menu and a few of the drinks. It is by far the best service I have had from any coffee shop and one of the best for any shop I have been to. It was also great to order from a person in the drive through rather than trying to bark an order into a box. The order was quick too, it was done while the gentleman at the window greeted me and introduced himself. In fact everyone inside smiled and waved and offered a warm welcome. 

I will definitely return to Dutch Bros every time I am in the area. It brightened my day to be greeted and treated as a guest and not just a source of income, the coffee was an added perk."
Positive	A very delicious Korean restaurant located in downtown Koreatown. My friend recommended this place for good Korean food and there were lots of great ratings coming into this restaurant. It's a very place so there isn't a whole lot of seating here. We were able to get a seat coming on a Sunday in the early evening. It got busier later on in the evening. We ordered different dishes. They also have combos that includes several dishes including alcoholic drinks. They have a limited beverage menu but have your usual domestic beers, wine and soju. The prices are very reasonable and affordable with dishes ranging from $8-$15. I ordered the Dolsotbibimbap which has assorted marinated vegetables with a choice of beef or tofu and rice in a hot stone pot. Also comes with an egg. They give out very generous portions and it was quite the delicious. It was nicely seasoned and they give a good amount of beef. We also got the traditional side dishes they give out when you're eating Korean food. We got 6 side dishes!! I always love the potatoes because they are simply delicious. Super friendly staff and a nice little restaurant. Service was awesome. We got our dishes on time and got everything that we asked for in a timely manner. They were really good about refilling the side dishes as we kept getting refills for a few of them. Overall, a very delicious restaurant to get your Korean dishes. Our group was very pleased with a very positive dining experience from start to finish. Will definitely be back! Highly recommended restaurant if you're in downtown Koreatown.
Positive	"I love this Safeway location! It is fresh and new and has the best variety of products. 
Staff are friendly and efficient. 
This location often has great Airmiles promotions. Grab a copy of their flyer when you walk in the entrance."
Positive	Legitimately one of the best gyros I've ever had. Quaint little place, and always terrific service. If I'm in the mood for Greek, I don't even consider anywhere else!! And I LOVE the feta & olives plate...huge block of feta & plenty of kalamatas...for $5!! Mmmmmmm.
Positive	A true 5 star find for gelato! They have Asian inspired gelato and the stinky fruit one is sooooo good. Omg, if you also like Vietnamese coffee, they have a gelato flavour as well. Perfect stop for when you are having lunch on Baldwin. This place is across the street from a Mexican restaurant and is near the University of Toronto. Come here for a cold summer treat. Your taste buds will thank you.
Positive	Great non-touristy coffee shop in the heart of Old Town. Free wifi & plenty of outlets make it perfect for working on weekdays. Solid cappuccino but not many pastry options. No set menu means I've paid a different price for the lime Italian soda each of the 3 times I ordered it. Not for those who like the options and structure of a Starbucks, but it makes me nostalgic for my college coffee hangout.
Positive	"We ordered the dumblings, the boss man highly recommended it. He said they make them in house. 
Basa fish dumblings - very good 
I would go back again for them
Singapore rice noodles - decent
Salt and pepper squid - this dish is why they didn't get 5 stars
Smoothies - boss man said only real fruit, I think he's right"
Positive	Good coffee and nice people. :) I really like the small town atmosphere; I always run into a similar crowd in the morning. The breakfast is fresh and delicious and they are nice about substitutions. The coffee is also pretty good - I haven't found better in the area.
Positive	Recently opened inside Holt Renfrew at Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Holts Café is a delight of healthy and comfort food. Perfect for a nice relaxing break in this very busy mall. It has a beautiful modern airy décor and it's not very big. The food is great, I ordered a croque monsieur and a kale salad. Both were delicious. You have to order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. The staff is very nice and courteous, they made sure my water was always refilled. In the style of European cafés, they feature a full bar, and all the espresso drinks we love to enjoy. There are also many pastries and sweets both at the drinks bar and at the food counter. Will certainly be returning!
Positive	"I love this place. I don't know the people here but I love them. I have never eaten here but I am glad that I did. 

If you're hesitating on Bloor street and can't decide between the sea of sushi houses, come here, you won't be disappointed.

The restaurant has a professional look and feel, kind of unassuming but well worth the trip.

As you enter, you are greeted immediately by your warm and friendly waitress. You can sit anywhere you want.

The tables are small but we were a party of 4. This is a very family friendly restaurant. 

We ordered the teriyaki chicken, California rolls, and udon noodles. No one left there hungry, we had some of the best Japanese salad dressing that we have ever tasted. The miso soup was hot! The California rolls were made fresh to order. The teriyaki chicken was all sorts of yum. The cold drinks were served in cold glasses. The salad was served in cold bowls. What attention to detail!

Be careful of the bathrooms, the locks stick.

Our waitress was was one of two or three and she never left us, she served us our entire meal.

After our meal, we weren't rushed out with the bill, we were allowed to sit and talk; how often does that happen!

The decor was nice and quaint, the staff were attentive and friendly, you are not rushed, prices are moderate, food was good and hot. The cold dishes are served in cold dishes.

I'm coming back, keep my seat warm and my drinking glass cold!"
Positive	"I had an issue with my car where a number of the electrical items went out on my car at once after a battery change out.  I took the car to my dealer, they gave me an estimate of $189 for a ""diagnostic"".   I went to Comb's after reading the Yelp reviews, and they narrowed the issue down to 2 fuses that had blown when the battery was reconnected.  $90 and I was done.  I was afraid he might come back with a laundry list of ""sensors"" or electrical parts that would need to be replaced.  They were very honest and showed me some additional care items that will need to be addressed in the near future (real items that I already knew about, not stuff they made up), and gave an estimate for those repairs, but with no pressure to do anything at the time.

Overall a great experience, I'll be back there again next week with my wife's car.  She needs a new headlight."
Positive	Good food, HUGE portions. Got a blueberry pancake plate and a waffle plate for 3 adults and one child. More than enough food. Good tasting food, very friendly and attentive service. Will give it another shot when I go to Vegas again.
Positive	Started with Dr Adikhari in 2016 for standard exams, cleanings, etc. came in for a crown today and the experience was far better than I could have imagined. State of the art equipment, extremely friendly team, just the best!
Positive	"This place was a pleasant surprise I have to say! Atmosphere is decent. It's not as crowded as other similar restaurants and service is the usual fare for Chinese restaurants - fast and straight to the point.

We had several dishes and most of them were good. The green beans with pork was excellent and so was the bok choy with oyster mushrooms and tofu. The snow pea shoots with garlic was decent. The fried rice with chinese sausage and taro was excellent! The crispy chicken was alright.. a bit bland. The soy sauce drenched duck wasn't so good.

All in all the price is right and so is the food (for the most aprt)"
Positive	Great location in Downtown Cleveland. About a 15 to 20 minute walk from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As a matter of fact, it is on the same street. We stayed in a suite that had 2 queen beds, a separate living room with a couch that folds out into a bed. Plenty of room for 4 people. Room and bathroom were clean, which is the most important attribute of a hotel room. There were 2 televisions, which was nice. When we got back from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they had complimentary popcorn which was terrific. It was addicting. In addition, they had complimentary breakfast in the morning. There were bagels, cereals, waffle maker, eggs, and several other items to choose from. Not much of a view from our room, as we were just facing another building. All in all, I was satisfied with our stay here.
Positive	"Since trying Line Thai for the first time and my first review of the restaurant, we have returned for lunch numerous times and dinner several times.  With each visit we find the food excellent.

We love the fresh Spring Rolls they create here and often will order them to take out at lunch time so that we can have them for fun Asian lunches we prepare at home.  The rolls really make our at home meals extra special."
Positive	Amazing club every time I go is a joy!! I'm local and I never get tired of that club the music is great I love the DJ that plays before the big names get on stage get there around 11 he is amazing
Positive	"The first time i came here. I ordered the veggie pizza,and guess what? It was soggy because of the veggies.

I haven't gone back until yesterday for lunch.  The place was packed and extremely loud  already at 11:45.

The waiter was nice,checked on us frequently and took our order pretty fast.

The food arrived around 20 minutes later, even though the restaurant was packed.I took the pancetta,mushroom and onions pizza.the toppings were well propotioned as you can get a bite of every ingredient in every bite you can. The crust was great and crispy. The amount of cheese was just the right amount. The size of puzza was a good 10 inch i would say. Prices are okay as yiu are gonna pay around 15 dollars plus tax n tip.

So after my second visit i would totally recommend this place."
Positive	The receptionist, Ivy, was wonderful. We go once a month for my son's orthodontist appointments. She always welcomes us with a smile (even when the office is crazy).  I had a lot of issues with my payments and she took the time to sort out all of the things.  She even remembered that I didn't want my son to miss school. So, she found him an appointment that would work best.  I am looking forward to meeting the new orthodontist because I didn't really like the other one.
Positive	I'm surprised by all the negative reviews.  I eat here often and never had a problem at all.  Food is good, and service is good.  I'm not sure why people are complaining about the price, you can visibly see the price before you order.
Positive	Ricky had to come out to my house late tonight because my AC would not shut off.  The guy super professional and knows what he's doing.  He could've easily put me off until tomorrow because he was home with his family.  He called to find out what the problem was and then he told me he was on the way. Very impressed.
Positive	This restaurant is tucked away in a little plaza but one of those places that is a hidden treasure! My sister told me about it so we went to have a glass of wine and a pizza and it was amazing! It's super cute and home style Italian looking! It reminded me of an Italian restaurant I used to love in Chicago! The cheese and bread  is home made and delicious! The pizza was awesome and I can't wait to go Back to try the pasta and everything else!
Positive	"Dante lived up to its stellar reputation.  We had an evening free of kids and activities and enjoyed an elegant dinner out.

We started with the Hawaiian Tuna Tartare.  The combination of flavors was terrific.  I rarely pass up a chance to have beef short ribs and I'm glad I chose that last evening.  It was beautifully presented, tender, and delicious.  My wife had the seared walleye fillet and it was excellent.

The dessert menu looked great but we had left no room.  Next time?"
Positive	One of the best pizza I have ever had. The mozzarella salad is delicious worth the flight to Arizona alone. I like there beer beer selection very unique. Just overall a great place for dinner or lunch.
Positive	I used C and A in 2009 for about forty shirts and logos. There were problems with my artwork, it didn't scale properly and Carlos waived the art fee to correct so we got a non pixelated, true color piece of work that matched my business cards. The last people left some nasty white backing on the embroidery, not these. It's been over five years and we still have most of these shirts still in service. I heartily recommend Carlos and his crew to you, you will be a raving fan as well.
Positive	"My husband and I had our Christmas dinner here. 
Our waiter was Friendly and Professional. The food was prepared to perfection, we enjoyed our Choices.
For dessert I had a Chocolate Martini, Yummy, 
The Atmosphere was warm and inviting.
Only 1 complaint, the server brought my Check along with my Drink, what came to mind was, 
""Thank you, please leave now""!!
Dinner for Two $150"
Positive	"Definitely worth a try!

There are a variety of ways to get many dishes.

The Szechuan wantons were the best I've had in town.  Spicy but in depth flavor and not too spicy.  In general on everything the spice level was just right.

Get anything they make dry chili style. It is spicy and salty but not too much and all in a good way.

Scallion pancake wasn't my favorite and they need to give you some sauce or soy for it.  Still very good and not too greasy, just in comparison to the other stuff it lacks.

Nice restaurant. My only complaint is the bar stools were too tall to eat comfortably. 

I definitely will go back."
Positive	I am someone who gets facial regularly and since moving to Vegas I have tried a few different spas. I first discovered Facelogic through Living Social and had a great experience the first time I came. When Spa Week came around, I decided to come again to see if I could expect consistent service and I certainly did! The aestheticians here are very professional and knowledgable. Due to the great service, I have signed up for their membership and look forward to getting my facials here on a regular basis. In regards to other reviews that found their treatment chairs odd or different, I have found them to be extremely comfortable as they are ergonomically designed and cradle you just right. Other reviews have also stated they did not like the fact that each room was not technically fully enclosed, however both times I have gone were on Saturdays (on the busier side) and did not experience any excess noise or other disturbance... and trust me, I am pretty sensitive to such things.
Positive	"When it comes to donuts, I am usually 'take or leave it' when I see some laying out on a table. I wouldn't normally make a special trip to actually buy donuts and usually ignore this section in the supermarket. That was until Duck Donuts came to town!

Worth the hype and more! I visited Duck Donuts on a Saturday afternoon. There were about 15 people there, so no long lines and was served pretty quickly. I ordered 3 donuts- the maple glaze with bacon on top, lemon, and orange creamsicle. I wanted to love the bacon maple donut since I love bacon so much (it's meat candy!), but something about the savory bacon and cake donut didn't taste the best together. So I guess I prefer a sweet topping instead of savory. The lemon and orange donut were excellent. So no complaints in the sweet tasting donut department.  

They weren't kidding when they say it's a HOT donut. It was hotter than I expected. That is what makes it great. It is 10 times more delicious eaten hot then some stale thing that has been sitting around for days. I don't even think I chewed, I just swallowed it whole! I thought it was going to be a heavier consisting, but it was pretty light. Hence me eating all 3 donuts in less than 10 minutes. Maybe I should start practicing and enter a donut eating contest. Hmmm, I might be on to something here...."
Positive	I am happy that Chronic Tacos has made its way to AZ. I am used to seeing this establishment in Cali, and I am a fan simply because they get that a lot of people prefer all white meat chicken. The nearby competitor has not gotten that message. My suggestions would be to make sure that the meat is always warm and to add another person into the serving rotation. It was a bit slow for the after 1pm lunch hour. I think they give you a lot of meat even for Taco Tuesday. I will definitely be back!
Positive	The people here are SO kind! Bummer there is no drive through, but sometimes its nice to go inside. Busy, yes, but what coffee place isn't? They really strive to be quick and have never gotten a drink wrong for me. LOVE that they write your name on the cup, how personalized! Parking is great, tough to get to from Eastbound Elliot but not a huge deal.
Positive	"I went to the dixie and eglinton new location. Fried chicken is always going to be gross and oily, but this one had really crispy skin and moist insides. It was quite nummyy!!
And the taters are really good too. 

I like that there there was a one peice. It's enough for the indulgence, and not too much to make you feel like a fat blob. Taters are bit too much carbs, but even tasted amazing the next day after putting them in the toaster oven for a bit. 

They were good about subsitutions and getting a certain part of the chicken"
Positive	"Come for the dole whips, stay for EVERYTHING! 

Ambiance galore! Tikis, music, art, mermaids, gorgeous servers, electric starry ""sky""...it's got to be seen to be believed. 

Drinks were strooong and yummy. $5 Mai tai's at lunch were so strong I had quite a buzz after the first (but I had 2 of course).
The dole whip was exactly as it should be. Creamy, dreamy, pineapply.

I will be making this a regular stop especially when friends are in from out of town."
Positive	One of the places I feel like everyone checks out when they are in Vegas, especially during the day. The store itself is alright but there is a beverage station on the second floor that sells Coca-Cola products. Everyone tries the taste of coca-cola around the world for around 8 dollars. It is nice to try it once but overall some of them are nasty and most people don't finish their drinks. Good store to check out at least once. Not as fun as the M&M store.
Positive	Good food, better beer, great service! Place is great for catching a match or grabbing dinner. Not a bar style atmosphere which I like! Recommend the fish and chips with any beer ... But Guinness is best!
Positive	"Really delicious menu. My three highlights and two areas for improvement are below. 

1. THE PRETZEL BITES WITH PROVOLONE FONDUE. there's really nothing else to say. Do it. 
2. The loaded nachos were really loaded. There is delicious guacamole, beans, a scrumptious cheese sauce, and much more. We licked this plate clean! 
3. The seating- there is a cool room in the back corner, a large square bar surrounded by tvs on each side. Also had community tables where 12 people can sit, first come, first serve. This is my favorite type of seating and it was great!

The rest of the food was also salivating (shout out to the tacos). But two things keep this place from being a five star rating. First, it's a bit pricey. Food was good, but each entree item was over $20 (except for the fish tacos. Hence why I got them). Second, the special margarita was very sugary and did not have much alcohol. I'm not the biggest fan of spending $11 for juice."
Positive	"Tabula Rasa is a breath of fresh air in Greektown. 

Just off the Danforth, the store is a swirl of hip, more well-known clothing brands, as well as a mix of indie Toronto designer accessories, and the owner's own selection of handpicked vintage (which is especially affordable!). Every time I go in here, I succumb to an Alternative Apparel hoodie, patterned vintage silk blouse, or find myself gazing longingly at the Petit Berets.

The interior of the store is fresh, open, and oozing with the same creative style that is reflected on the industrial clothing racks, which makes for a great venue for the many events that are held here. If you happen to come across an invite for one of their summer parties, check it out - they open up the backyard. And for good reason, with all those fashion/hipster/buzzy bodies in the shop, you'll need the air."
Positive	"Really good food and pleasant fast service.  

Even though I wasn't very hungry when I my parents and I went to breakfast here I still managed to eat my entire spinach and feta omelette, hashbrowns, a few bites of toast along with a sampling of Mom's Greek omelette and Dad's blueberry pancakes.

A friendly face and charming personality ""Wes"" greeted us at the door when we walked in.  Although it said seat yourself, he lead us to a table handing out menus as he let us know someone would be right with us.  Always a good sign when you get the last table in the house - not too packed that you have to wait 30 min for a table but busy enough that you know the place is solid.

My parents and I have hit a ton of breakfast places over the years.  This one is definitely worth a repeat visit.


Notes: 
The interior is plain so if you're looking for ambiance this isn't the place.
Also, it's not what I'd call expensive but our bill for three (3 meals + 3 cups coffee) was $27.98."
Positive	Secret nails has their secret values!!! Jason did an outstanding job! He had the patience of an artist, hence, all of his work turns out amazingly beautiful! I'm in love my nails, words cannot express how happy I am with the results. Thanks Jason!!!! Great customer services, friendly staffs, and most importantly! they produce great quality at the work they do. I've been to so many other salons that all they care was rushing you out to make big bucks, charge you legs and arms, but in the end, my nails were pretty ugly. But NOT Secret nails. This place never ceases to amaze me. Give them a try if you haven't already !
Positive	Addiction is a fun, trendy place to dine. The service was satisfactory & the food was delicious. Executive Chef Stephen Austin is very personable. We greatly appreciated that he came out of the kitchen to greet us, ask our opinions of the experience, gave us some background on the food, & even take a fun photo with us. Overall, I'd recommend dining here.
Positive	"This location is more than just pay check advances, they have pre paid visas, money orders, and western union! The ladies here are pretty nice and attentive and get to you quick. The store itself is neat and clean and has a little play area for the kids.

I come here only for money orders! If you cash a check they are free, otherwise they charge .75 cents! Sometimes they wont even charge you!

Ill continue coming here for them MO's!"
Positive	Taco Tuesday was a great find, low cost with good food and drinks. I mean really low $2 tacos beef, pork, fish, chicken, etc. I had the fish and the beef which were stellar. Service was fast even though the place was crowded, hello college students trying to save and have a good meal. Def the place to go when you are trying to save money while not skimping on the quality.
Positive	"Ding ding ding!!! 

Ahhh Red Rock! Since I'm not a regular on the strip and dont need glitz and glam this place does just fine for me! I love how its open and the light cover thingys are pretty rad! 

What I like most about this casino is that it has a Regal Cinemas theater! It also has a Kid Quest when I wanna just leave my nugget and gamble for an hour (although I havent!) I plan on trying it out!

They have a lot of fast food eateries, Panda Express, Rubios, and all that plus they have Yard House and other nicer restaurants which I havent checked out!

All in all I like this casino because its not filled with annoying tourists! I also like it because they have some pretty awesome shows coming up! Pitbull, Blink 182, and all the ones in the summer!! AWESOME!!

Go here if you dont need the hustle and bustle of the strip!"
Positive	"This is the only place I take ""the Smurf"" to get his hair done that he doenst get all freaked out & come out with his beard soaked from stress saliva (YUCK) They are awesome and always do a perfect job. ANNNNND, they didnt charge me and arm, a leg and a half like the place I went to in Tempe!"
Positive	Great tacos, lots of flavor, the carne asada tastes amazing and their green sauce is great. The atmosphere is pretty cool. I would go there if you want some great tacos for a decent price.
Positive	We had a great time I would recommend this to anybody we will be going back to experience the other rooms. If you get there early it's nice that it's across the street from the Pinball Hall of Fame so you can play games there before hand.
Positive	I have been a member of Massage Envy for over 5 years. The hours are great no matter what your schedule. The therapist  are attentive and all the staff are very polite.
Positive	I didn't really understand the definition of the word FUN until I got here. Where to begin? Me and the wife first got there around 10 at first they were playing some wack ass hip hop so we went to the bar to grab a drink. Around 11 I decided to whip out my friend shroomy to see where the night could go. Within 20 minutes of being introduced to my friend the night got simply more and more epic. Finally around 12 ATB came on outta nowhere, and HOLY FUCK he took my experience to the next level. I saw Vegas for what it really was while I was there. Everything made sense and all I could do was smile. The venue was epic cause its set up that no matter where u go, u always land up back on the dance floor. We finally left around 3 and needless to say my third eye was wide open by then. I stepped out and saw Vegas in a whole new light. I strongly recommend going to this club and chillin with shroomy or Lucy. Make sure to go when there's a dope ass dj spinning, the vibes this club gives are truly epic.
Positive	"Terrific exterminator company!  They have great rates and came right away.  $67 for the first treatment and $37 a month for every subsequent treatment for a 2300 sq ft house. They also promised to come back for free if I see anything.  The service guys are really friendly and do their job really efficiently.  I didn't have to move furniture or clean out the garage or anything. I have avoided getting an exterminator for a while and sprayed myself because I figured it was just going to be a big pain.  A lot of them advertise that they ""educate their customers.""  I don't want to be educated... just kill the bugs! But Bulwark made it really easy.  I didn't even notice the spray and my husband, who usually is affected when I spray, hasn't noticed a thing. And have not yet seen a creepy, crawly scorpion (which is the only pest I will NOT tolerate!). I highly recommend this company."
Positive	I stopped by for a chipped windshield repair and I could not have been more impressed. Kelly was welcoming and arranged my service right away. Freddy and Carlos went to work and repaired my window in record time. Their service and workmanship was first class! I would recommend these guys to anyone! Five star service
Positive	Great food. Close to home and extremely friendly people. I'll be coming here all the time! My whole family loves their food. The falafel are made fresh, and they will soon make home made baklava .
Positive	"Local friends recommend this place so I did no Yelp snooping beforehand, but it turned out to be a huge hit. I will say that food/flavor/atmosphere-wise it deserved 5 stars. However, there were only 2 servers working on a busy Thursday night and although they were trying hard, it definitely hampered the experience a bit.

 
Unfortunately, most of the food was ordered from our friend's memory so I'll have to just describe it rather than name it. Now, about the food:

Starter Salads: 
They ordered two, both of which were topped with generous helpings of a very light and fluffy feta cheese. It sounds like it could be overbearing, but it wasn't and totally worked with each. The first was like a traditional Greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, and of course the fresh feta. The second had watermelon and basil with the feta. Both were light, fresh, and very tasty in their own idiom. 

Sleeper pick
We got two helpings of a hot and fluffy pizza crust type bread with a fried egg in the middle. You stir the egg yolk around on top and then tear off chunks of this very tasty seasoned puffy bread slathered in the egg yolk. Words again can't do it justice, but it is sooooo good! Order one just to try and you may have to double down like we did. You are in Vegas after all. 

Main Course Dishes:
We had the Eastern Lamb dish (can't remember the actual Russian title but it was two words with a lot more consonants in a row than usual). It was cooked just a hair too well done for my taste, but in all fairness I didn't order and specify the temperature. The seasoning and flavor was bold and very tasty. 
We also got what was described as ""Siberian Burgers"" which was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. I highly recommend this. 

The ambiance was very eclectic with EDM versions of the latest dance songs playing in the background, but not overbearingly loud. The lighting is low, but the walls and furniture seemed to be painted and bedazzled gypsy style, which makes you feel like your in the Eastern Bloc and not West of the Vegas Strip. 

I would definitely come back and recommend Forte to friends wanting to eat in a local gem."
Positive	If you live in the Shea / Scottsdale area definitely check out YMCA Scottsdale. Well maintained location, classes such as spin, etc. are at convenient times. Been there many different times of the day and have never seen it too busy. Also very affordable and the family plan includes childcare in a good size room for the kids to play in while you are working out.
Positive	"Great place for tourist, locals, old timers looking to reminisce, etc. Cool neon sign from outside...one of the coolest on the square! When you enter, you immediately feel like you stepped back in time: black and white photos, tile floors, stools at the stainless steel bar. Even the lighting is well done.

Drink prices are perfect if you order something like a draft or basic drink.  Grab an iron city!

Food prices aren't expensive either. I didn't eat there, but their fish sandwich seems like their most popular item!

I sat at the bar for 30 mins, saw a handful of people come in and out, and only heard friendly conversation and comments. Great place for being the oldest on the square!"
Positive	Awesome job Paul.. I've been in the automotive service industry for 24 years (Airpark Auto Clinic) and when are customers need seat motor repairs, we send them to Power Window Repair.  Always top notch service, in cases where complete components need to be replaced, Paul and his team have rebuilt or re-manufactured the component itself and saved not only us, but our customers money.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.
Positive	Susan Sandys helped my husband and me to create a family trust and estate plan.  Susan is knowledgeable about Arizona estate law and was more than flexible in working with our erratic schedule.  Her services were totally covered by my husband's corporate legal plan so it didn't cost us anything extra to have this work done for us.  We can't recommend Susan Sandys enough.
Positive	"I usually go to Nikkos downtown for Sushi.  It is a great place but you pay through the behind there.  This Yoshi Grill is a solid place.   EVERYTHINH ON THE MENU IS VERY, VERY GOOD.  Domestic beer 2 bucks.  International beer 3 bucks.  Cheap, tastes good, good service.  GIVE IT A SHOT.

PS-  1/2 PRICE SUSHI EVERY WEDNESDAY"
Positive	"I've only made the first consultation but I was pretty impressed with the depth of the initial consultation vs the price.

A few years ago I talked to my primary care doc about weight loss and he just said ""eat 1200 calories a day and here's a month's worth of pentermine prescription""  The primary care doc plus script was like $200 out of pocket because i hadn't met my copay.

Here I got much more in depth weight analysis, they actually asked me questions about what I currently eat and made suggestions, and counseled me seriously against trying Phentermine as a magic cure-all.  

I know how to lose weight, I've done it before, but I needed just a *little extra* willpower help, and i think this is a good place for that.  Everybody I talked to emphasized eating well and working out over the pills."
Positive	We had such a great experience our first night in town that we went back two nights later. The food is perfect and simple. This isn't high end designer plate stuff. The oysters are fresh, the entires are huge. The lobster roll is fantastic. The service was excellent. They were fast, attentive, and kind
Positive	"This is the place to be apparently!  Excellent service, good food, and heaters on the patio! 

My experience with the restaurant is from hosting a happy hour for an organization in which I am involved. 

Parking: easy - it's in this shopping center with all these other stores, similar to one of the other billions of outdoor strip mall type things in the valley. 

Service: amaze! We had a very handsome guy and lady help us out for the happy hour event. They were attentive, nice, and provided suggestions. This was a happy hour for individuals in the health field, and they provided ideas for veg-based foods.  The waters were refilled every few minutes, and the food came out super quickly and was good. 

Food:   One can order happy hour foods only at the bar, so we did not.  We ordered: Chips and guac, ahi tuna, chips and artichoke dip, Brusells sprouts, caprese salad, roasted carrots, and a few other items for folks to share.  The grilled artichokes/dip were delicious! This was a unique dish. The caprese salad and roasted carrots were also tasty. The artichoke dip was mostly cheese and very little artichoke or spinach.  The roasted carrots were warm and slightly sweet -soft but not mushy. 

Ambiance: Chill, seemingly like any other trendy chain place. 

This place was *packed* on a Tuesday night at 6-6:30pm. I did not realize it was such a happenin' place, but with the service and good food, I can see why!"
Positive	"I have been only volunteering at Toys 4 Smiles for a few weeks now but I can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound, make children happy. In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a ""I want it yesterday"" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem ""worth it."" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it. It's a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life. 

I encourage anyone looking to donate some time (doesn't matter how much) to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys!"
Positive	I love this place. Delicious food delivered quick and piping hot with a smile. At a steal quite honestly. The coffee is excellent and you can sweeten it with stevia too. This is my fourth time here and the service is always friedly and spot-on. Right now I have to get back to enjoying my scrumptuous Santa Fe skillet plate and fabulous protein pancakes before they get cold...Ta!
Positive	"I started going to TGI Fridays about 5 Yrs ago. I've been around the country, and the TGI's in Monroeville is the best. The staff is very friendly and the prices are on par with the typical chain restaurants. Now let's get to the important stuff, the food.  My wife and I had been looking for a place to make ""ours"" since I moved up here a few years ago. We had tried many places, but for some reason, not TGI's.  We stopped in there one afternoon at random, just because we were passing by. When  we tasted the Jack Daniel's sampler, we were in love. Lots of chicken and shrimp and ribs, an appetizer big enough for a meal (in fact my wife frequently orders the app for her meal). The potstickers are excellent too, very addictive.  On to the steak. I'm a major carnivore. I firmly believe that good meat doesnt need messed with much. At TGI's, the steaks are good quality cuts, cooked perfectly to order. I usually don't even add seasoning or steak sauce to mine. Try a bite first before camouflaging the meat, you'll be pleased! For those who like seafood, get the salmon with langostine lobster bites, it's every bit as good as the steak! Out of all the meals at the TGIs in Monroeville, and the takeout (two bags is the norm for us), i've never had a bad meal.
They also have a great bartender. My wife loves the dreamsicle, and while I'm not fond of sweet drinks, that one tastes exactly like the ice cream.
So to summarize, THIS TGIs should be used as an example of how to serve food and make people happy."
Positive	"DR. RICHARDS was so kind.  He made me feel completely at ease from the start. I couldn't be happier with my mommy make over.  
It's only day 2, but my stomach and breast look amazing!
Thank you"
Positive	"BS +++
Another great trail and small entrance at the end of a small path.  Lots of cute but huge  property and homes  here.  It's another path you will see along the way to the canyon.  This place is a perfect place for hiking/camping or mountain climbing.  Lots of the nerds who come here have huge camping bags.  Come during the winter time and spring.  I have a feeling the summer here is packed and you can barely find parking.  It's a small area not sure if you can leave  your car overnight but I would assume so.  Wear comfy hiking shoes (again your hipster Toms or your  beautiful Yeezy will not survive here) I wore my Y3s and their  gross!!! I love  trails.  Trails are amazing.  Trails are life.  These mountains here are gorgeous.  If you want  to get away from the city (only 21 minutes away if you drive like me) and be careful of burros (donkeys).  Also, becareful of human burros (drivers).  This is a one lane road and the speed limit going to this path is 25 mph.  If you are in a hurry to hike then you should hike from home.  If you want to be buried on top of the mountain don't be rude!!! This is a great get away!

Positive	Best sushi ! Never fails! Quality is #1 and make sure you get a loyalty card = free sushi ! Best price & quality for what you can get on the Plateau. Perfect for a quick fix lunch or dinner. Get the Mexican, mini-kami, rainbow...they're all great.
Positive	First, the good stuff- the cupcakes are really, really tasty. I've had several varieties, including the Buckeye (peanut butter-chocolate) and the lemon-banana. They do not have too much frosting, nor is it so sweet that your teeth will hurt. However, every time I've visited, service has been really slow. Not sure if that is due to indecisive customers or the person doling out the goods, but it's annoying.
Positive	Stopped by today and picked up a tasty juice. Very friendly people and willing to help you out. Juice is on the more expensive side at $12 for 15ML. but the flavors are very tasty so I picked one up because it was unique. Probably won't visit often because of the price - but a very friendly place and has a great social area for hanging out.
Positive	As someone from Oklahoma, we've got a lot of bbq. This bbq was just as good as any place in a more traditionally known for bbq state. I got the fried chicken and the breading was very good. My family got the brisket tips which were also good. Great atmosphere, blues band played the whole time.
Positive	I went to see Francis yesterday at the Golden Nugget. My shoes were in such bad shape that I thought I was going to need a new pair. However, within 10 minutes, he cleaned them up to look like they were new.
Positive	"Pretty cool place! They have countless tvs with all kinds of sporting events on them, and they have a system where you can listen to your game over your smart phone. This way there isn't fighting over who's game should be heard. Downfalls... the people don't know what channel the games are on. Tried watching an LA Kings game there and was told repeatedly that it wasn't available. Luckily my brother know the owner and regulated... Well wouldn't ya know? They were able to find the game... what a shocker... the all you can drink happy hour is pretty cool too. Get it with the Groupon and save yourself $10. The bad part is that it's all Bud products or well drinks made with ass-flavored liquor. What do you expect for $10? 
Food is meh. 
Vibe is cool.
Chicks in cheerleader outfits... effing awesome!

LETS GO KINGS!!!!"
Positive	"Great food, great service. My kids loved our server Bethany. She was attentive and very nice. The location is convenient with lots of stores. I will recommend this place to my family and friends. The Southern Eggs Benedict is amazing. 
Seee ya next weekend!"
Positive	I came in 2 days ago today on Friday  Darryl is the new manager a true professional very and accommodating explain to me the Dynamics of my new investment in tires in also found me a $50 rebate for Cooper Tires . niod Mao di was of great help to have my lug nuts replaced with chrome ones he took me right in and asked me if I like to come in and have some coffee great crew here I highly recommend this location on Sahara thank you
Positive	Good place to eat , tacos are amazing and they have house Tuesday's with a cool atmosphere and a mini dance floor out side with people dancing :) def a plus!!!
Positive	This is the best Thai massage ever. I have been there many times. I met Helen  and Jasmine.  They were awesome . I went many Thai massage in town but they are not good like them . I like the place is very nice and relax. Ohh I really like this place . I will back to them all the time . Everybody should come here .
Positive	My husband and another couple went here to eat.  We had a rubuen, scotsdale salad, potato skins, french dip and soup.  All of our meals were fabulous and we are harsh critics.  Our waitress, Rose, was fantastic.
Positive	"A great way to check out some local food trucks. The variety of trucks was great offering a nice selection of food options.

The food trucks there offered everything from hot dogs to Polish food to a variety of sweets to BBQ to vegan foods. All of the trucks were nicely spaced out so it was comfortable to walk around and there was plenty of room to wait for food. There were picnic tables to sit and enjoy food as well as an area of tables and folding chairs. 

I enjoyed this food truck festival more than another that happens in town every six months. Sunset Park'd doesn't charge admission and trucks are not on top of one another. The music was also at a pleasant volume allowing for conversation."
Positive	"Holy shit I can't believe I still haven't rated my favorite place right now. I work from the Crew café so I'm here at least once or twice a week. Lunch: solid options. I get the Katsu curry, chicken karaage, gyudon and ebi-teri don.

Grab a few beers after work (happy hour specials on the Sapporo) and order a few plates from their izakaya-inspired menu. Try the chicken wings, the bibimbap, or any of the soba noodles.

Say hi to the owner Hide or chef Hachiro.

Arigatou gozaimasu"
Positive	It was my first time here and I was more than impressed with their awesome foods, really satisfying service and clean place. I was more than happy that there are more and more fantastic Asian restaurant here in AZ. We will definitely come back soon.
Positive	"My friends and I like coming here when we have big gatherings as this is a decently big place and the happy hour is always good.  All the sushi rolls are pretty good, but the items I always get are Mixed Tempura and the Spicy Tuna Roll.  I love the mixed tempura here because the breading is thin and the dipping sauce compliments the tempura so much.  The spicy tuna roll is also a better quality than most of the other places I've been because the quality is good, but they also give you alot of tuna.  Other rolls that are good are the dragon roll and the caterpillar.  

The happy hour drinks are always good. I always like get the hot sake as it is very cheap and delicious to me.  Sake bombers are good too!"
Positive	My wife and I had a great time here celebrating our anniversary. Great views of downtown, the service was good. However keep in mind it's not a fast paced kind of restaurant, but it's probably to give time to enjoy the views as the restaurant turns and gives you a 360 view of downtown Phoenix.  The waiter was great and we had a good time!
Positive	"Believe the hype.   Great cocktails.  Really good steaks and fantastic service.  Ronny, our waiter absolutely killed it with his suggestions on whiskey cocktails.   Their mixologists are on point.    The wives loved the Pimms Cups and the appetizers and sides were wonderful.  Mussels, carpaccio are recommended.  

Do not miss the add ons to your steak.  

Vibe is old school.  Dark, classic music and very fun.  

WE CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK AND BRING FRIENDS."
Positive	Hey Hairtarstic is a great shop to go to get your hair done right.The owner is kind and well known. And I been going to Robbie for 30year or more . I love my hair stylist
Positive	"My husband and I have been coming to Gypsy Rose for a couple years now. We originally followed an artist from another shop, but were so impressed with the shop and the people, we stayed when our artist moved. 

The Friday the 13th special they do does require a little patience, as they've only gotten more and more popular, but it's worth the wait. They always have great flash and it's always a fun atmosphere. And once you get into the chair, you have the artist's full attention. You don't feel like just another cheap tattoo.

All the artists have been great. We love Mark and are looking forward to getting work done with Phil and Lexi as well. 

Don't hesitate to check this shop out!"
Positive	"Ripples, litterally one of THE best place for ice cream in mtl. Big portions of exquisit artisanal ice cream and original sorbet. Soft ice cream as well for the ones who enjoy their classics. Chocolate lovers, you might find your soul mate in the 6x chocolate or the chocolate truffle and real rasberry ice creams that Ripples offers you with absolute grace. Tried many of their flavors and was always oh so satisfied with their raw taste. 
Ripples -a discret yet savory dairy bar of the plateau.

Note: They also offer other dairy treats such as frozen yogurt if you feel to cut down on the sugar"
Positive	"My buddy and I had brunch here before our day at the MIM and wow, what a great experience!

We are totally ""those"" people, he's a vegetarian and I'm dairy free. I know, I know, annoying. Tryst totally doesn't mind! Their menu caters to all types of tastes and requirements. They proudly serve a creative and organic menu.

We each had a spicy Bloody Mary. Fricken delicious, they're made with cucumber vodka and all sorts of veggies: olives, pickled green beans, celery, cherry tomato. The works. Totally hit the spot.

I had the Huevos Rancheros. Anytime I see this offered in a menu, I get it, so I'm kind of an expert. I wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. There were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. It was more like a ""build your own"" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. Good flavor though.

The service was great as well, you could tell the girl was knowledgable and fun. The manager (or owner?) also stopped by to check on us and was super friendly.

It's really nice to have a small mom and pop type eatery in the land of chain restaurants and shops. 

Highly recommended!"
Positive	I took my Jeep in for a tire rotation and balance, and to replace the thermostat.  The guys did a great job with the car and a great job of calling me to keep me informed on the updated costs and when they were done.  The cost was totally reasonable, and I will definitely be back.
Positive	"This is a lovely place. It's clean and the atmosphere is inviting. They have a good customer service. There is a huge selection of drinks (juices and smoothies).Their juices are very fresh and delicious. You can try different kinds and listen to the explanation of the health benefits of each ingredient. And then you can buy the one you prefer.
The only ""bad"" thing is that it's a little expensive and you can't afford it very often..."
Positive	My favorite pizza in Madison, and right up there with my favorites in the country.  Yes they are now an uber-chain throughout college towns in Wisconsin but they make great pizza.  The dough is great and they always brown the cheese, which I love.
Positive	First time going to any type of fitness class here in Vegas and I am very glad I chose the Z Spot! Love the different classes they have. I have tried the extreme boxing and Zumba and I loved both. The Zumba was pretty easy to follow the only thing is the teacher faced us so was a little harder to learn that way unless of course you know the choreography. But it was super fun and the music was great and the teacher was amazing. Now the boxing kicked my butt it was great!!! I usually never get sore from a cardio without weight class and my whole body was sore! Definitely going to get a membership here!! Great place to have fun and workout!
Positive	"I stopped by today with my friend and we saw their Raw Himalayan Salt Lamp for 40%---what a deal!

We told the lady that we will be back and we'll just go around Tivoli village for our steps. After an hour, we came back and what's great about it is that she already wrapped and bagged our lamp in a very nice plastic bag with paper and stuff---impressive indeed. 

Love the vibe and their persobalize guest service!"
Positive	Dr Rao & Ryan were outstanding in their treatment of my son who had 7 teeth pulled. Dr Rao's connections to her patients is clear and it makes the environment comfortable for both patients and parents!
Positive	"I came to this place multiple times. I love this place the environment is amazing the seating is great. The way the service working is unique the lady will come give you the menu with a bell when you ready to order to use the bell to call her. I ordered caramel makato which was good. What I really love about this place is the environment so if you want to come here with friends or a girl this place will be your good choice as it is nice and organized. They got the red light above each table I guess we will know what the lights are for.

Regards,
K"
Positive	I think this is one if not my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. I did the tasting menu and loved everything. Desert is not something to miss - try the cracker jack dessert with peanut brittle and popcorn ice cream.
Positive	This was my first time ever getting eyelash extensions and Julie was incredibly nice and informative. She told me everything I needed to know about having them and told me tips and tricks on keeping them lasting longer. I LOVE the way they look and I plan on continuing to go here to get my lashes done.
Positive	They are wonderful!  After loosing a beloved dog to cancer in March and then almost loosing our puppy Odin (8 mos) to tick fever.  I came here for the first time very apprehensive and scared. We love our dogs like any other member of my family and they understand that.  They are all very kind, courteous, caring, understanding and I could go on and on. I can not say enough good things about them and Odin loves them.
Positive	I moved from Tucson 4 years ago, and was extremely homesick for authentic Mexican food when my best friend suggested we go to Nino's--that was 2 years ago.  Ever since then, we have been going about once a week.  They are the most affordable family restaurant around. The staff treats us like family, and the know our order the moment we walk in. I am grateful to have a place I can go to where I feel like family!  We love Ninos!
Positive	Amazing price and fast service. I checked several places to get the best price. I needed a screen replacement for an iPad 2. Everywhere I looked was between $80-$120 to repair and most of them quieted anywhere from 3 hours to 48 hours turnaround time on the repair. I walked in at 4:45 and my iPad was done by 5:30 - 45 minutes!!!!  Also, the cost was only $39.99. Amazing price and fast service. If I could put more than 5 stars, I would.
Positive	I've been coming here for many years. Overall they are very good. Reasonable pricing for sure and the clothes don't smell like chemicals. I am a regular that brings several items a week. They've never ruined anything. Also accommodating when I need something rushed.
Positive	"This place is like a crazy cheap compared to other Ice Cream places.  They offer milkshakes, and SUNDAES on Sunday!  

Last night I had a Sundae with Cotton Candy, and Mint Chocolate chip.  MMMmm.   This place is going to be missed if we move away. Great customer service, friendly chipper girls helped us out with our first time ever ordering here."
Positive	I live across the street, and have visited Hotel Valley Ho for breakfast, brunch, and dinner more times than I'd like to admit. One perk about living at The Standard is that you can also order room service to the apartments. The most recent visit was last night, 2/1/2018 and was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in my life. The M.A.L.T (music, attitude, lights, temperature) was spot on, and our server, Alex went above and beyond. We ordered the Tartare, Oysters, Scallops, and Short Ribs and I can hole-heartedly say that every dish exceeded my expectations. Even the General Manager stopped at our table to introduce herself, and you could feel that the customer service here is genuine. We received a complimentary snack of 2 Rockefeller oysters, which I've never had and LOVED THEM! The special of the night was Chilean Sea Bass was by far the best I've ever had from coast to coast. I cannot say enough about the quality of food and service and will recommend dining here to everyone and anyone I know.
Positive	Not as easy to get to because there is no drive thru but this is still by far my favorite Starbucks. The employees are always so cheerful and helpful. Sometimes i come in with 4 teenagers and they never flinch art the large order. Ask them for suggestions and they are on it. I am always looking for a new drink i can make a skinny.  Thank you baristas you are great.
Positive	This place was big, wide selections on clothes. good deals. cant beat that! the line does get long and they dont have much cashier, when i went -they only had 2 cashiers when there were more than 10 people in line. people are on the go in vegas so it would be nice to have more cashiers so people can just buy and leave instead of waiting forever to be rung up. PRICE for sure is CHEAP! clothes are CUTE! the only thing is that its big but there is so mch selections that it gets crammed up. barely any space to walk and you end up bumping into people.
Positive	Good place. They get stuff in you never see anywhere else. They do a good job of tracking down collections. They have lots of cheap records with some gems to be found from time to time. This place is good... consistent fresh stock, good lean cheap records, fun $1 bins, and a cool owner.
Positive	The food is on point. I got a shrimp po boy the last time I went. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly, and they weren't stingy with it at all. It just takes a long time to get your food. Honestly though, that's not going to stop me from going back because I have my eye on that oyster po boy now.
Positive	"These folks are great and I am very impressed.  Here is what I have experienced:

- They do what they say they will do.
- They are courteous.
- They are quick.
- They have skills.
- Their new shop is big and beautiful.
- Their prices seem very reasonable.

It is rare that we get exactly what we expect, but that has been my experience here."
Positive	Been here twice, the food was great both times! The chicken strips are, in my opinion, better than Canes as they are well seasoned and juicy. The fries are great and the variety of sides and sauces is wonderful. The fried pickles are TO DIE FOR. They are crispy and delicious, especially with their homemade dipping sauces. Spread the word folks, this is a great place!!!
Positive	This gym is very nice and clean. It doesn't smell like sweat. Lol The child care area is nice and clean as well. I like that there are cameras in there so you can check in on your little one from the cardio theater t.v.s on most cardio equipment.
Positive	Happy to have found great Chinese Delivery from Bamboo China. Tried and really enjoyed Mongolian Lamb, Eggplant and garlic, Mu Shu Pork and the Mandarin Scallops! Fast and HOT delivery too. :) Now my first call...
Positive	Beautiful decor and delightful food! This is, in my opinion, the best off-strip place for a great culinary experience. I love the artisanal cheeses and ever-changing menu. Reservations are often necessary and I always run into people I know there, so be prepared for that. If possible, request an outdoor cabana at least once. It is really peaceful. The trees strategically control the view and shelter from main street viewing.
Positive	"Mr. Elias Monge, 

Hope all is well! You have made Audi Henderson the greatest Audi in Las Vegas!!! Your knowledge and authenticity is greatly appreciated...all should contact this wonderful seller for a great deal!!! So happy!! Great job!!!"
Positive	"I love learning stores for educational toys/games/art supplies for the kids and this one does not disappoint. They have a large selection and the staff is friendly. Some items may be considered overpriced, like another yelper suggested they could just go to Wal-Mart for their pens, but that's expected. 

I, myself, am not a teacher but was shopping with a girlfriend who is. She shared the same sentiments about there not being much for a teacher who teaches outside of Elementary. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out. I also believe they offer a teacher's discount."
Positive	A decent, less expensive hotel in a good location of Montreal about 8 minutes walking from Mont Royal metro station.  Staff is friendly and are able to speak English.  They hang one of a choice of 3 different breads on the doorknob each morning around 6AM.  The hotel is above the ground floor, so you have to climb some steps to get to the main hotel floor.  The only complaint I have was being on the first floor, it was so noisy.  I think there was a night club downstairs or something.  If I were to come back, I would most likely ask for a room at a different side of the hotel.
Positive	One of our favorite Chines restaruants.  We especially love their walnut chicken.   Slightly sweet walnuts, succulent chicken.  Also great sweet sour soup.   Service pretty good.
Positive	"Every time you walk into a Shoe Carnival they have some sort of deal going on.  BOGO are their absolute favorite deal or Buy one and get the second pair half off.  If not they have this big wheel right when you walk in by the cashiers that you can spend to win discounts like 20 - 40% off.  They carry a nice selection of sneakers and since I'm usually in the men section with the bf I've noticed Timberland, Nike, Adidas, and recently Sperry.  He was able to get a pair of Timberland's for about $39.00 once with the sale they were having and a extra 30% off coupon that I lucked up on.
I've noticed that they seem to have a great selection of kids shoes b/c I see a lot of parents in there with their kids trying to get the cuties to sit still long enough to try on one pair and then another.  They have some sort of kid games in the store and that's usually where they would like to be instead (it's quite entertaining to watch).
When I'm looking not to spend a lot of money but would still like a nice pair of shoes then I come here...remember they don't have a big selection but they do have a decent enough selection where you can have a few choices."
Positive	I loved the nostalgic feeling Rambo's has.  It was great seeing displayed items from the 60s.  Brought a smile to my face and joy in my heart.  They not only have food you can order and eat, but have a variety of table games you and your family/friends can sit and play.  It was a little pricey, but for the jogging of memories it was worth it.  Our waitress, Lisa, was awesome.  I'll be going back.
Positive	This place is awesome. Just moved here from out of town. Glad to find this less than a mile from my house. Whoever said the gun selection is minimal is out to lunch. Plenty of rental handguns, suppressed weapons, and full autos for rent. I just bring my own guns, but I loved this place. Will go again soon! Thanks Teds!
Positive	This place is a little pricey but very good. I had the the Salad St Tropez which consisted of proscuitto and melon and come with a little caprese side salad and crusty bread.  We also ordered several pastries which were extremely buttery, flakey and not too sweet.
Positive	"Came here for date since it seemed like a out-of-the-box idea and was affordable ($10 when purchased tickets online). 

You enter the little comedy club through the side door, kinda dodgy. And immediately see the bar & bartender whom you have to check-in with before entering. Most people get drinks but you're not pressured to. Make sure you arrive 10-15min early to snatch good spots. We attended the 9PM show in October 2017. 

The host starts out and really plays off the crowd. He's absolutely hilarious. After about 10 minutes of his own antics, he'll introduce the next pre-headliner stand-up comedian to perform. There were 5 pre-headliners and majority of them were GREAT. Styles ranged from dark humour, jokes that resonated with my immigrant & minority roots, funny stories with punchlines & just straight up weird funny sets that lasted ~10min each. 

The headliner himself was great as well, energetic stage presence and super animated. Wish I could've seen online what the line-up is so I can follow their shows!! 

Overall, I loved every second. Super neat way of experiencing live stand-up comedy and laughing up a storm.

**UPDATE: we came here again for the 7PM show on June 2018 and the entire line-up and host were different...unfortunately for the worse. A lot of the sets started off very awkwardly, were A LOT more vulgar and sexual, and just not that funny."
Positive	One of the best Poke boxes I've had next to Hawaii. Fast efficient service. Line was out the door but moved quickly.  They cater to dietary restrictions and know exactly what has what. (Gluten & Dairy free was no problem) next time I'm getting double fish. Will be back soon
Positive	What a great MedSpa!  The staff are all friendly and made me feel right at home.  I was unfamiliar with some of their services and they were helpful in educating me in how the services would help me achieve my goal.  They were not pushy nor did they try to up sell me.  Their monthly plan is an amazing deal.  I've had 4 appointments and every experience has been amazing!  I highly recommend this business.
Positive	"When I pulled in the parking lot I got the last spot at lunch yesterday.  I probably wouldn't have tried the place if there wasn't a parking spot available.  You walk in and place an order at the counter.  You are given a number and someone brings food to your table.  Drinks are self serve.

I ordered a fattoush salad with an appetizer order of falafel.  With a bottle of water the total came to around $12.  The food here was made to order fresh and arrived at my table when ready.  So the salad and falafel arrived separately.  I like that.  Get it when its ready so it isn't sitting around.

The portion sizes were perfect.  Fresh tomato, onion,cucumber, scallion, lettuce, parsley was mixed in with a tasty, tart dressing.  The pita chips were plentiful and seemed baked rather than fried.  But I could be wrong.  There was a healthy dose of sumac on top as seen in the picture as it was also mixed into the salad as well.  It was delicious.

Falafel were not too big and not too small.  I found them just right.  Crunchy exterior.  Soft interior.  It was a good example of a falafel.

I enjoyed my visit.  The staff was super nice and I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."
Positive	"This was a great choice for Italian food. We went here on a weeknight and was told that we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. We went to a nearby bar to get a drink while we waited. The front of the restaurant had a bar but to stand at it to get a drink, you would have been in everyone's way as they walked by. 

The waiters and waitresses were very courteous. It was a great atmosphere. The food was awesome. The pasta was fresh and the sauce was so flavorful. 

My only complaint about this place was that the bathrooms were pretty gross. You have to walk down some little stairs to get to a basement. There were two small bathrooms that smelled kinda funky... like moldy. They just didn't match up with the upstairs."
Positive	I have been getting my nails done by Abi for nearly 2 years and she does such an amazing job every time. She uses high quality products and I get comments on my nails everywhere I go. By far the best nail artist in Scottsdale!
Positive	Really nice staff, they didn't mind me taking a look at all of the memorabilia on the wall while waiting for my order. The food itself was very good. I had the blueberry pancakes. If you can get a seat out on the balcony there is a great view overlooking The Strip and was a very enjoyable experience.
Positive	"My sister in law is in town from Lithuania and her boyfriend is a long time vegan. Given that the four of us wanted to go out to eat together, I had to find a place with some vegan options and came across this location on Yelp. 

I called and spoke with someone on the phone who told me 50% of the menu is vegan so the choice was finalized! 

As we walked up, the sign says 'The Market' and I didn't see any signage for 'Bronze Cafe' so I wasn't sure if we were in the right place. Luckily, a staff member was outside and was able to greet us. As we stood outside with a sort of lost look on our faces, he said 'if you're looking for a good place to eat, come on in!' And we did! 

Lots of great menu options. I am a big protein eater so I wasn't looking for anything vegan. I went with the Daniel Special and added double protein. It was fresh, and delicious. 

I'd go back any day! In fact, I likely will sooner than later in order to try their pay by weight salad bar which also looked good. 

I also got a few really good iced teas. A passion fruit one and a green tea. 

My sister in law's boyfriend got the vegan chicken and waffles and he said it was hearty, filling, and very tasty. 

Highly recommended."
Positive	I really love the workmanship that Sukie's Bridal Tux Shop offers. She sewed my sons patches in his Taekwondo uniform and they are straight and sturdy. Price is a bit high but you get what you paid for! I will go to Sukie's for my future alterations, thank you!
Positive	"These guys are great. You can't go wrong with the services they provide. We were broken into in October 2013 and finally decided to get home security. We looked at other companies and honestly came pretty close to signing up with national companies like ADT. I looked one more time and found these guys. I think their youtube video convinced me more than anything.

I called them up and they came by the next day to get things going. If anything it gives you a peace of mind. The sensors accidentally detect when, say, a glass pan breaks so that should tell you how sensitive they are. Customer service is great. Compared to other companies they really are a huge deal for what you get."
Positive	My hair looks amazing! I love my new color and cut. I can't believe I got my hair done at South Park for the amazing price. My stylist Justin did a great job. My friend was with Cassandra and she did amazing as well. The new location is pretty and clean inside. I'm definitely coming back.
Positive	I really wish their menu was bigger but I do enjoy the ambience and quality of the food. Jenna was great.. I feel badly because we were her last table and I know how annoying that is but she didn't seem bothered!
Positive	What a wonderful french bistro in the Venetian Hotel.  I loved the french toast, smoked salmon mini baguette, and the scrambled eggs special.  The service is excellent, of course.  Overall, great restaurant for a decent price.
Positive	I have had the tacos, tortas, constra, fish tacos, and all their salsas. EVERYTHING IS TREMENDOUS. The owner is one of the nicest guys and all the employees remember my smiling face.
Positive	i had 1st Choice texture a damaged ceiling.   The patch was invisible when they were done, and he even did a couple small spots on the wall that had been filled but not textured yet.   Reasonable price, very fast, and great results.   Will use them again for sure if the need arises!
Positive	Elizabeth was fantastic. She really took the time to understand how I like to style my hair and gave me a great cut. When I mentioned I might be interested in trying something new next visit, like highlights or bangs, she really took the time to brainstorm fun ideas that I can't wait to try. Looking forward to scheduling my next appointment with Elizabeth soon!
Positive	"From the first contact to the end result, everything at Renaissance was incredible. I was so pleased with my experience. Cheryl and the team at Renaissance really took the time to sit down and listen to my experiences as an employee, job searcher, and general human being. I felt comfortable from the moment I stepped in the door. Truly an experience with a firm that I had not had before.

Not to mention, I love my placement! Going on nine months and still pleased that it was the right fit. Thank you!"
Positive	"I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and Hoang Oanh are the real deal! The locals come here for a quick sandwich which is a great sign. I went with their chicken bahn mi and it hit the spot. It was delicious with fresh tasty ingredients and the bread was perfect!

Price-tag is very accommodating and it's great if you're on a budget. Staff is nice however they seemed disorganized, we ordered 4 sandwiches and they had a real problem tracking who ordered what.

Cash ONLY."
Positive	"Ein echtes Erlebnisrestaurant im uralten Bahnhof von Pittsburgh am Station Square. Umgeben von Industriedenkmälern (Stahl !!!) und mit einem beeindruckenden Blick auf die Skyline von Pittsburgh.
Seit meiner Zeit in Pittsburgh Ender der 80er ist das einer der liebsten Plätze zu dem ich Besucher einlade.
Das Ambiente ist vibrierend und amerikanisch laut. Das Gebäude im luxuriösen Jugendstil lässt sehr gut erkennen, dass Eisenbahnfahren früher was Vornehmes war. Aber die Fotos an den Wänden zeigen auch sehr drastisch wie schmutzig eine Stahlstadt war. Blauer Himmel- Fehlanzeige.


 Tolle Austernbar. Im Restaurant esse ich persönlich immer von der Seafood-Auswahl, am liebsten die ""Bouillabaisse mit Dungeness crab, scallops, mussels, shrimp & fish in a rich saffron broth; Add 1/2 live Maine lobster"" mit dem Lobster!!
Aber auch clams, scallops und all die anderen Dinge sind gut.
Unbedingt reservieren (online) und um einen Tisch ""at the windows of the glass house"" bitten. Das ist der in einen Wintergarten eingeglaste ehemalige Bahnsteig. Dort hat man den Blick auf die Skyline wie auf dem Foto. (Das Nachtfoto ist vom darüber liegenden Mount Washington).
Parken ist in der Nähe in einem öffentlichen Parkhaus gut möglich."
Positive	"We started every night at Whiskey Down, and if it was still open, finished our night here, too. 

Between the convenient location within the MGM, the random happy hour specials, proximity to Blackjack tables, and the sweet, efficient servers, this was our perfect spot for meetups, pregames, gambling reprieves, and tell-all's of the people we met during the day. 

This bar has a slightly upscale feel to it with a nice drink menu and a good secluded feel from the gambling floor. Our first night in Vegas (and MGM) I stuck to my trusty Tito's and soda with lime. After four, my total was $18. I don't even understand how that's possible. The following night, my husband's Manhattan's were half price. It was like happy hour specials roulette, you never knew what you'd land on! 

And despite the bar's name, there are a lot of other options to sip on. I didn't have any wine, but as long as Tito's is behind the bar, I'll be parked in front of it. 

If you're staying in MGM, this is your perfect pregame ""neighborhood"" bar to hit before your night out."
Positive	"I've been going to the Real McCoy since i was a kid for over 10 years now. My parents lived in the area previously, and have always loved it. 
The food is simply amazing, and they have a wide selection to pick. 
Steak on a bun, an 8oz home burger, chicken on a bun, you name it - they have it. 

The prices are fair, but often are very pricey if you go with a can of pop and fries/rings with your burger. 

The ingredients are always fresh everyday, as they get used up the night previous, so there is no leftovers. A bigger selection of sauces could be added, as I tend to add some of my own when I get home. 

The onion rings and fries are made on location. Nothing frozen or store-bought. I've even seen the older gentleman make the onion rings. THINK rings dipped in large amounts of batter. PERFECT! 

The general approach to how orders are taken could improve, especially on a busy Friday and Saturday evening. You basically walk in, and try to figure out who has had their order taken and who hasn't, then wait for an employee to assist you. Everyone stands anywhere, even some people place their order, then wait at the back. Maybe a simple queue line could be added, where you stand by the cash register, place your order, pay, then walk 2 feet and tell the guy what you'd like on your burger, then walk out the door. 

My recommendation for quick food: steak on a bun, with fries LIGHTLY done, with gravy on the side with a chocolate milkshake. 
If you're looking for dinner, I'd go with the simple home or mojo burger, and either the onion rings or a poutine, and again, a chocolate milkshake. This dinner pick is all HOMEMADE! You wont find this at a McDonalds or Harveys. 

Everyone in Scarborough should go to this place. Trust me, it's worth your time and money."
Positive	"Let me start by saying plan on a few hours here it's huge so much to see .
staff is very familiar with there products and eager to share if asked.
Steve miller and josh the manager are so incredibly help full , not just lip service either it shows they truly value customer options and input. They have great customer service and that truly means a lot theses days . it's so hard to find anymore.  
Hats off to Josh...can't say thank you enough. Great input on optics too"
Positive	Hey, it's Baskin Robbins. No gimmicks, it's not hip, but the ice cream is excellent and the prices are ok. FYI: They are now offering specials on yelp and on foursquare for checking in!
Positive	"After reading all the reviews we decided to go for it!! I am so glad we did!! Great Dosa!! Great service from our server Joe!! And mutton biryani was really authentic!! 
So lad we found Nirvana!! Thanks Yelpers!! You rock!!"
Positive	This place is so awesome! I've never been to a popsicle bar before but I can't wait to come back. You get to pick your popsicle, either sorbet or yogurt and then they have a ton of toppings. The popsicles are Instagram worthy as well as delicious. I got a strawberry sorbet bar with white chocolate toppings and it was super yummy. They even have combinations set up for you if you can't decide.
Positive	Ate at Joe's on a recommendation of a relative and it was even better than I expected. The place is a lot more upscale than I thought it would be. The waitstaff is in tuxedos and the decor is really nice. The service is top notch and the waitstaff was very knowledgable about the menu and all of our waiters recommendations were spot one.  I had a Caesar salad and the grilled seafood platter. The table had some of the cracked crab as an appetizer. The crab is served cold with s mustard sauce for dipping so it's better as an appetizer than an entree in my opinion.  The seafood platter consisted of lobster tail, shrimp snd bay scallops and they were grilled perfectly.  The table shared a few sides; asparagus and potatoes and they were excellent as well.  I had to try the Key Lime pie for dessert and it was as advertised. A couple in our party had the banana cream pie and said it was amazing. Stellar meal all the way around!! Joe's is all they say they are.
Positive	Excellent local craft selection. Plenty of cantillon in bottles! Great ambience. Outdoor patio is fantastic. Didn't try the food but it smells great. I will be back next time I'm in town.
Positive	"Was downtown at Union station a while back when they had a small food market and saw that Uncle Tetsu's had a stand.  A combination of hearing a lot about this place paired with my loving anything with cheese in it quickly convinced me to line up and give it a go.

The cheesecake was unlike anything I have ever had before, certainly not run of the mill.  It was almost as if a normal cheesecake went against its family's wishes and bred with a sponge cake.  The cake was soft and moist, not overly crumbly and wasn't overly sweet!

I would definitely go again, however I'm not eager to brave the long lineups!"
Positive	I was a bit hesitant coming here, reading other peoples reviews. I had sunspot that I was worried about and in the past I have been to other skin cancer clinics to have my annual checkups, but I was looking for a doctor that would be a little more personable. When I setup my apt, I was advised that they had a form I could fill out online to save time, so I did. Thus when I got there, I was in and out in under 30 minutes. I had a full body check and he checked everywhere and anywhere I had a concern he told me what it was. The only bad thing that came of my visit was that I have to wear more sunscreen on my face... I hate that stuff.. so oily.
Positive	"We ordered vegetarian Fajitas and drank the 3 Amigos Margaritas, which was good and well served by a waiter called Lighting, who also guided us to choose the appropriate dish to order. Overall a good restaurant, will definitely visit it again.

The ambience of the restaurant was good and literally made us feel to be in Texas"
Positive	This has become my place to go for car repairs.  They are honest, friendly, helpful, and a pleasure to do business with.  Will be going back for any and all repairs on my vehicles.
Positive	Been coming here for the lunch special every Saturday for the past few weeks now. It's usually pretty empty, but the food is tasty and fast, and the owner very friendly. Don't expect anything too fancy, just simple honest food.
Positive	"I have been a fan of the Lychee Inn for over 10 years and have eaten there about once a month during those 10 years.  My mother loves chinese food and for our Chinese dinner out together that's where we go and order the same thing every time because it never disappoints:

We start with the seafood soup which contains shrimp, crab, scallops and is absolutely delicious.  Then the potstickers which sometimes are better than others but always good enough to keep getting them every time!  Then, the shrimp chow mein with garlic and the beef and broccoli.
They bring out fried bananas for dessert compliments of the restaurant. 

The food is plentiful and there is always half left to take home!
It is not fine dining but is fine food and reasonably priced.  The service is good and the servers friendly.  The setting is casual (there is a TV on the back wall)and the space is cozy and the important thing is: the food is good!"
Positive	"Had a steak with a baked potato. Steak was cooked perfect. This may sound petty but no bacon bits for the potato. It's a nice place and the food is good. Easy to get to down town place. I stayed at the marriott 2 blockes away. If u like steak u should stop by, but bring ur own bacon. Just kidding u will like this place

Visited November 2011"
Positive	I woke up to my 3 dogs licking a slipper gooey mess on my kitchen floor in front of my side by side and discovered my frig had dyed.  After calling several neighbors to see if they had any room in their freezer or frig for my semi thawed food; and making a few runs with my food to any neighbor who could help; I called my favorite Appliance Company, Spencers and told the Salesman, Dave Gibson I was in trouble my Refrigerator/Freezer was on the blink; he said they only recommend Lewis Appliance Service for repairs. I called Lewis at around 10 or 11 AM and spoke to Mary she was quick to put me at ease and said they could be out there the same day; however it may be as late as 3-4 PM; they were also very proactive and she asked me the model number, which I thought was awesome.  Vince called me at 3:30PM and said he'd be there with in 18 minutes.  He came in and with in 3 minutes and found the problem; and even better he was prepared with the parts needed to fix my frig.  I can't tell you how relieved I was because I thought he was going to tell me to get my shopping shoes on and head to Spencers for a new side by side; just a week ago I was shopping for appliances with my Son and I did notice that the new nice quality Frig/Freezer combos are now running in the excess of $2500-4000. With in a few minutes Vince had replaced the Mother board to my GE Profile and even cleaned up and vacuumed the dust.  I was elated to write a check for $455 instead $2500+.  Thanks a bunch!!! Vince you rock and Mary was such a Dear!  Referrals are the best compliment and I'm going to be their outside rep in South Tempe, AZ... :)
Positive	I have been here for business for a little over a month and am amazed at all the great food in this area, so I expected nothing less than the best and was not disappointed.  The atmosphere was great and food even better.  I'm sad I may not be in the area again anytime soon. Give it a try, you will not be let down!
Positive	My driver side door was hit which left a dent between the door and fender, scratches as well as a cranking noise when opening my door. I drove to a few places I'd seen on yelp for repair quotes and A+ was honestly the best quote at $550 while competitors ranged up to $1700. Being a woman I felt I was being taking advantage of before meeting Abe. He was super nice and took my car in right away and the job was complete in 2.5 days! My car looks amazing and I would refer this place to anyone looking for affordable and trustworthy work. Thanks Abe!!!
Positive	"Yeah, I know that everyone has wrote a review about this place

It took me a while to get up to try this quaint little gem out, but it was well worth the wait. I went up on Sunday afternoon (12/1/08) for brunch with my friend Jamie. Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside. 

First we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. 

For how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) 

While we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees. 

I was very impressed with the style and uniqueness of this quaint little gem."
Positive	"The Coffee Garden at Talking Stick Resort provides a nice and relaxing setting for those who want to take a breather from the hustle and bustle of the casino happenings. There is ample seating, with plenty of large windows as the view, Peet's Coffee and even dueling pianos on some nights! If they just served cocktails at night, they'd be set. Yes, I know it's a coffee garden, but when they have dueling pianos it would also be great to have some cocktail servers offering drink service downstairs in addition to upstairs. 

Now I will touch upon Peet's Coffee. Their iced coffee is the perfect way to put a little kick in my step. I go with the iced mocha with sugar free chocolate and about halfway through, I'm bouncing off the walls --- in a good way! 

The Coffee Garden is probably one of the most hidden spots of Talking Stick Resort, but definitely a location worth keeping on the radar for that time when you need to escape the craziness of the casino."
Positive	Came here for dinner with one thing in mind, the famous DB Burger! ($32, 9oz beef patty stuffed with foie gras and braised shortribs - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmh6zxtJ8C8-YiUPv7ySlw?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw)  I've been reading rave reviews about it on Yelp so I had to try it.  Didn't even bother looking at the rest of the menu, though I'm pretty sure everything else is really good.  So yeah, laugh it up that I paid $32 for a burger.  I'm not ashamed, it was so good!!  Burger, fries, and a glass of Muscata....the perfect dinner!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside.  I love how you have an open and up close view of that huge waterfall show outside the Wynn.  The shows were trippy though, but they helped enhanced the ambiance of the place.  I also had a very good waiter.  I liked how he guaranteed that my muscato would be very delicious or else he'd drink it himself if I didn't like it.  I had to apologize to him because I liked it.  Nice overall dining experience for me and I would definitely come here again to try their other entrees.
Positive	Love eating here, staff is super friendly. Always remember the regulars that come in to dine. I always eat the spicy green beans and chicken pot stickers. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new. Keep up the great work Pho.
Positive	Delicious! The sauces you can put on your cheesesteak are so yummy! Their fries are also really good! The place is clean and the service was good. I've tried both the chicken and steak sandwiches and was not disappointed.
Positive	One of those places I really meant to get to for a long time.  Got the chance the other evening for an after party. Only real negative: pretty much forced valet, complimentary other than the tip.  No trouble getting seated right about dinner time on a Thursday, they were busy our whole time there. Wile not right at our side the whole time I thought the service was pretty good, and pleasant.  I got a sample of my first choice of beer and glad I didn't go that route but the waitress listened to my comments and made a suggestion which was very good. I had a really good tasting cheeseburger with a side salad. Two of our party shared a pizza and I didn't hear any complaints.
Positive	"I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this place. Definitely one of my new favorite restaurant for sure. 

We had their Arizona Almande and Original Daiquiri cocktails. The daiquiri was not what I expected at all! It was not the same frozen drinks you would think of when you think of daiquiris. It came with really pretty garnish. It was also very strong, which I like. 
We destroyed our food before we got a chance to take pictures. We got Crispy bites for our app. We shared a
Lobster Mac (AMAZING) and Da LOLA burger (HUGEEEEE). I noticed that this place has a lot of sharable foods with great portions. 
I have already recommended this place to a lot of people."
Positive	"This place has been consistently on point through all my visits.  Pre-yelp career through today.  

Inventory:  Well stocked and smartly organized.  This place is just too much fun to walk through which is dangerous af.  Kind of like when i was a kid and went to the fireworks stand, and I end up spending cash on all the little fun stuff in the front which I didn't budget for, something like that. I usually come in there with 2 or 3 main things to buy, I end up walking out with multiple supplements or items I had no intention of trying which has led to some good finds.

Service:  The staff is very knowledgeable and is always on point with assistance.  Whether it's locating items or just discussing on what you're considering purchasing.  They talk you through it in such a friendly manner.  At check out, they offer free samples, fantastic.

Pricing & Value:  Prices are very similar to what you'd find online.  However, the convenience of grabbing your supplements right here,right now because you need to fuel and/or recover your high performance body today, is priceless.

The friendly service, knowledgeable staff, amazing inventory to just walk around through and immediate gratification purchase keeps me coming back.  If you're completely new to the supplement world, a seasoned scholar and everything in between, this place has you covered."
Positive	Delicious! I am amazed by the quick, quality and quantity of Food here. I have Had the Pad Thai twice and each time I love it Even more. My husband says this Is his New favorite Chinese food spot And I couldnt agree anymore. We sat at the bar And watched the cooks demonstate a complete live cooking show For us. Very fun.
Positive	I just had my first experience at gisoo with Samantha and she was amazing working with my curly hair! I love the results of my haircut and I'd definitely recommend this salon!
Positive	"I've been here for lunch and dinner with my husband, in-laws, & old boss. I've had the pizza (surprisingly good), sampled the Penne Rustica (my husband's favorite, very heavy), Eggplant Parmigiana (excellent, my favorite dish here), and Honey Balsamic Chicken (excellent). Recently the menu was changed, but still decent italian food at reasonable prices. I think that since we've been to Buca Di Beppo a few times, it's my husband's favorite italian place at the moment. 

Popular family restaurant with an elegant ambiance with both types of seating- booth & tables- also has butcher paper and crayons (ok it's not so elegant, but it can be entertaining). The service is usually pretty good. I heard that there is an opera singer performing on weekend nights, but I am guessing it is usually reserved for saturday nights. I almost forgot to mention the bread basket, and that the server mixes balsamic vinegar into the olive oil for you (good combo). If you ask, you will get seconds. 

Can be pretty busy at times, so if you're unsure, make reservations to avoid waiting. If you sign up on the e-club, you get free chocolate cake on your birthday."
Positive	Best buffet I ever had. Very tasty many kinds of kitchen from all over the world. Will go there again. Would avoid 3-4pm. One star less is for the price. This buffet maybe worth $45 but definitely not $60. But honestly, after I tried hugely disappointed Wicked Spoon with $50, I realized in Las Vegas everything is pricier. Very good service. They cared about the kids' comfortable and safe, match a suitable table for us.
Positive	"I was so happy with my car buying experience here!!! I researched for a LONG time about car values, milage, deals, financing, the whole 9 yards. I went to 4 different dealerships and got the ""used car sales man"" run down each time. I would consider myself an educated buyer, I knew exactly what I wanted, how much i wanted to pay, what the car was worth etc. I even reasearched buying a car in California for a better deal. Now, long story short.. I walked into the dealership and was not bombarded by sales men, I was greeted by the receptionist and she got me immediate assistance. Our salesman was named DaMon, and he was phenomenal. He was feeling a little under the weather but that didnt stop him from giving us 100% undivided attention and assistane in the cold weather. I told him what I wanted, he found it for me. we test drove it, and boom sat down to sign the deal. No hassle. There is no haggeling, the deal  I am so happy with my car and the deal I got. Thanks for the great experience!"
Positive	Loved it! Had the best breakfast! Ordered a freshly squeezed juice, and an acai smoothie that was so smooth and delicious! To top it off they were playing a Beatles album and it was just perfect!
Positive	Great experience. We got the all you can eat sushi. I was stuffed after 1.5 rolls since they bring out the appetizers and rice first. I dont think bbn I got 20 dollars worth of food but the sushi was great. Service was fantastic. The sweet tea is sooo goid. We will be back
Positive	"Best service by Tommy and Carol!!  This place is clean and always entertaining!  A diverse crowd that will always keep you amused.  If you are a regular or a newbie, Tommy always makes you feel warm and fuzzy, and is easy on the eyes, if you get my drift ladies!  Carol is about the best bartender I have ever seen, friendly, professional and sweet as real sugar and real sexy too!  Not to forget the rest of the crew, Tina & Helene will always put a smile on your face!  Go there anytime and once you do, you will return!  It's one of those kind of bars that you can just say ""Cheers!"""
Positive	"OK It's been a long time since my last review!
I've had to up the ante here, since I think I've got nearly 25 checkins :/
My favorite thing is 24 HOURS.  I crave coffee at all hours and it is amazing here.
Prices are fair compared to Starbucks and the flavors are different.
I love a place with Monkey Mocha and Red Velvet.
Oh BTW, hot red velvet mocha just stole first place as my favorite of all time hot coffees. It used to belong to Starbuck's marble mocha macchiato.
The drive thru is rarely busy, which is how I order most of the time, but they do have some stellar food here. I've had a couple things and they are all made in house.
Try it out, I love it."
Positive	This place was such a great find. My husband and I are vegetarian and don't eat a lot of raw food. But it was incredibly filing and flavorful. We had the hummus plate and the mexi sampler platter. It was so good. And the staff was incredibly friendly. Definitely checking this place out again when we are in town.
Positive	"Yesterday (Jan 6th) was my wedding day and my hair and makeup artist did not show up. In a panic I called around and Cody at Ulta Beauty was able to block off an hour for me to get my hair done right as the store opened.
Then, Emily did a most spectacular job curling my hair and making it beautiful for the big day! Thank you so much Emily, thank you for being willing to work me in and acting with such grace and patience!!!"
Positive	"I needed basketball jerseys for my rec team and was referred to The Graphic Edge by someone else in my league. I must admit the first jerseys they sent us were not what we thought they would be. The issue was the printing and the jersey fabric (which was more like a mesh than a solid fabric). I wasn't happy with the initial order, and got in touch with them about a refund or reorder. They worked quickly with me to resolve the problem, and get us new and improved jerseys. 

Just make sure you communicate with them up front about what you are looking for. What I really appreciated was there customer service and helping to fix the initial order with cost to me and my team."
Positive	"Came here right when they opened at 11 am and while there was already a line, I was seated quickly at the counter for bar service. I'd recommend sitting at the bar if you're in a hurry. There's also a nice view of the kitchen staff as they prepare orders and cook food.

I already knew that I wanted the wonton soup and was able to order it right after I was seated. It was a nice, big bowl of soup that really hit the spot. There were seven large, tasty dumplings, the broth was warming and the noodles had a nice al dente bite to them that made the dish very filling.

Knocked off a star because it's on the pricier end for Chinese food. It's to be expected because of the location but still, $16 (including tip) for a bowl of noodle soup is a little up there."
Positive	"The best baklava ever!! You'd never suspect to find good baklava at a store that mainly sells bulk dry goods but it's true. This baklava ($3) is super chewy, filled with nuts, and drenched in an obscene amount of thick, delicious honey.

If you prefer the dry, flaky, pistachio filled, honeyless crap that, unfortunately, shares the same name as this delicious Greek pastry then stay away; this isn't the palce for you.

Reg Dried Foods is, of course, mainly a purveyor of dry goods. Their stuff is all great quality so, while you're scoring some delicous baklava, you can also stock up on nuts, coffee, spices, and dried herbs."
Positive	"I'm going to make this nice, short, and sweet.

Jesse was our server, he did a fantastic job. Duncan, among 2 or 3 others helped ensure our evening was as expected, dropping in, removing dishes off our table. Justin, the manager, whom we spoke to last night about the superb service, they all are incredible. I can't speak highly enough of these three gentlemen and the service they provided.

It was my first time here, at the recommendation of my date. We had the bruschetta board, bottle of wine ($20 for both on Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm) and we shared panini. It was spectacular. Never had bruschetta before, not sure what to expect but we have concluded that Postino's is going to be our Monday or Tuesday evening go-to each week.

I wish I could award these guys a 6th star, they really did a great job at ensuring we were happy. It was an awesome experience"
Positive	Got seated right away. Menu is a good mix of traditional and some unique items. I had the skirt steak. It was good, but didn't really care for the seasoning. However, it was prepared just as I asked. The BEST part of our experience was the incredible service. Alex is the best. We will ask for him when we return. All-in-all, a very pleasant experience.
Positive	"A great speakeasy with live music on Saturday nights. A nice location too right on E. 4th where everything is happening. We enjoyed listening to crooner Phil Turk all night on Saturday. He was great! He sings from 9pm to midnight every week. 

The drinks were very good (A bit pricey) but good. The Moscow Mules were $12 and a beer will cost you $8. Feels a bit like going out in LA but you do pay for a classy venue and live music. I loved the set up of the bar and that there were a lot of tables and seats for everyone. We had the best seat in the house on the red velvet couch right in front of the piano. I would recommend getting there early to secure a spot. A great place for a date night since it is a cozy and romantic setting!"
Positive	"This is a nice little place with a great atmosphere and a really welcoming interior.  Decorations are great.  As you're traveling North on Central, you have to pass the restaurant and then take a quick right-hand turn into their parking area.  If you park in the lot South of the location you'll get towed.

Food was fantastic.  It was really, really fantastic.  Everything was fresh and natural.  they have quite a few gluten-free items as well, which was great to see.  Spring rolls were delicious.  Gluten-free Chicken Pad Thai was top-notch.  Chicken curry was downright delicious.  Price was right, and we did not leave hungry!

Their service was what knocked them down to 4 stars.  Reading the other reviews, I have to agree with what has been said before.  Place was empty at 11:30 AM on a Saturday and the service was SLOW and kind of ""space case.""  The young lady who served us looked like a manga cartoon, to include hair and makeup, and if that is fashionable, that is great (I guess) but she sort of pulled an attitude with the gent who was also working that day.  Not sure if he was a server, but he was certainly stepping in because she wasn't up to par.  When he mentioned a concern from another table, she got a little snotty with him in front of us and several other customers.

If we're in the area we'll certainly stop by again.  Food was delicious, and NOT HOT AT ALL, which was great for us.  I understand that if you really want them to ""bring the heat"" all you have to do is ask, but our super-sensitive stomachs were MORE than pleased with the ""base-level"" spice.  We'll make sure to attend during a slow time, however, because if the service was that slow with only a few people in attendance I can't imagine how it is when the place is packed."
Positive	"Marc and Kat his wife since taking over the management team has done a great job keeping the area clean and safe 
Work out room is always perfect and the all around rv park is quite and freindly
Kat makes everyone happy with her cheerful personality 
Marc has the office organized  and his employees making customers happy 
Pool is big but needs to be chlorinated more as it stays cloudy and could use the water filters circulating water better 
Pool boy would be a good idea to keep better attention 
Hot tub sometimes works sometimes down for repair iffy but mostly clean 
5 if the pool conditions are little better 
Washrooms/laundry always clean and good working order 
My stay is always pleasant and will return soon"
Positive	"The hotel rooms had everything you need, the bed looked funny, but it served its purpose.  There were many great places to eat, gamble and explore inside the hotel.  This place serves as a great place to start a walking tour of the strip ending past the Circus Circus.
If you come back to the hotel, there is plenty of wild happenings."
Positive	"Great massage with Jennifer! She goes the extra mile to make the experience better than what you expected. I added the aromatherapy option to my massage, and she took some effort to set things up in such a way that I could smell the oils throughout the massage. I had not been to this location before, as my wife signed up here a few months ago and recommended Jennifer highly.

The staff at the location are very friendly and thoughtful.  The waiting area (and treatment rooms) are relaxing, clean and upscale. Can't wait to go back!"
Positive	"I have seen this place grow up in front of my eyes: a few years ago, when the store was a small run down shack to the new, much larger (yet still relatively run down :) location. P.s being run down is a sign of good food in Pakistan, so fear not!

They are known for their bun kababs. The bun is pan fried to perfection, the kabab has the right amount of meat and flavor. Add some home made chutney and spicy ketchup and the resulting product is sheer awesomeness. 

To this, throw in the run down-ness of the store, the shalwaar kameez wearing aunties, the Hindi movies/songs playing in the background and a bottle of Pakola and it's as if you have teleported to Karachi just to have a meal. 

And to boot, the prices are very reasonable. 

Only negative: no credit/debit cards accepted so bring cash."
Positive	Went Down in quality from 2 years ago but still really good. Before it was 5 stars and mater chef. Now it's about what u would expect from 24 hr dining in a nice hotel. Great.
Positive	"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of Gertrude's. Tonight, I was able to stop in for after-work wine and apps and I was not disappointed. The place is lovely - nice outdoor patio and great art on the walls. We ordered three appetizers; carpacio, stuffed dates and brussel sprouts. 

While clearly not a full meal, this was a great way to try out the restaurant. The dates were AMAZING. The setting is superb. I'm going back on the weekend for breakfast."
Positive	"This is an excellent hospital. The high quality was apparent from check-in (on June 11, 2015) and was maintained throughout my recent stay for hernia surgery. The anesthesiologist, surgeon (Dr. Richard Harding), OR nurse, and all other staff were excellent. Even the room cleaners and maintenance workers seemed to enjoy being there and to keep patient needs at the forefront. All the RN's were terrific and strove to help each other keep an eye on all the patients. I want to give a special thank-you to my ""angel-of-mercy"" RN, Donna, whose knowledge, skills, and compassion were extraordinary. Everyone I asked said that they enjoyed working at this hospital, and that attitude was reflected in the quality of attention and care they provided. If only all institutions were run like this one . . ."
Positive	Great place to eat!!  Everything about our experience was excellent.  Korean food that I consider Authentic. I've never ate kimchi cooked alongside the meat but I'll do it again. Especially here. Can't beat the lunch special. The menu says pork is from jeju Island. All I know is that it had an excellent taste.
Positive	I love Club Cancun.  The office staff is really great and helpful, they don't come in without permission, they keep the grounds and lot looking good, it is a nice diverse community!
Positive	"I really enjoyed the food here, in the beginning we didn't think much of his place, like someone already mentioned in a previous review, don't judge the book by the cover. The place is clean and simple, service is good and quick.
The food was really good and tasty, I suggest you try their coconut flan  is out of this world delicious!! Yeah we will be back!! Oh the down side of this place, they don't have a liquor license."
Positive	"Last week, my cat was attacked by a dog and Deer Creek was the closest place, (I had never been there before). It was by far the most horrifying experience I have been through, but Dr. Robbins and the staff made it as easy as it could have been. I read some of the other reviews before writing this one, and someone mentioned Dr. Robbins seemed like a dog person. When she told me the news about how Stella was doing she was in tears and I could see it was very hard for her to give me bad news. We ended up having to put Stella down and every member of the staff that was around was in tears. I'm sure they see this a lot, but I don't and this was my baby and they really made me feel as good as I could in that situation about the decision I was making. 
We are going to board our dog there when we go out of town in a couple weeks and also try their training classes if they have any available, I just felt very comfortable there, and like I was in good hands.
Oh, and the night we put Stella down, Dr. Robbins called me to check on me and tell me how sorry she was. That really meant a lot."
Positive	"Birthday cake yogurt with fruity pebbles topping. The end.

I've gone here so much the price thing has started to bother me...  I cant afford to go at the rate i've been going (once a week)

Also, the clientele makes me feel kinda violent more times than not.  Particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  The comments and laughter of uppity tweens is not for me."
Positive	"My family and I came to vegas for a mini vacation, and we wanted to get our nails done while out here. We yelped nail places & Today Nails was one of the top to come up. I am very happy we made the choice to come here! We called about an hour in advance, and they were able to take me and my two sisters in at the same time for mani/pedis, and they did an excellent job! They were extremely friendly, didn't rush, and were  very attentive. I got a set of acrylics done by Nancy, and she did a wonderful job! She made sure that my nails came out the way I wanted, and I'm very happy with the result! Ben did a fantastic job for my pedicure, and he took the time to make my feet smooth and gave a detailed foot massage. He was also gentle when cutting my toe nails, cuticles, and fixing my ingrown nails which was great! Ben and Nancy also did a great job with my sister's manicure, and Phil did her pedicure. Phil was very thorough, and my sister enjoyed her pedicure/foot massage. Kita helped my other sister, and she was very patient and attentive. My sister was indecisive about the design she wanted on her nails, but kita was kind, patient, and did an excellent job with both her manicure and pedicure. Overall, all of our nails came out super cute and were all super happy with the results. This place has hard working employees who truly care about their customers and provide great service! Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to be back here for my next mani/pedi. I definitely recommend this place :)

PS. They have a lot of different polish colors to choose from and the price is affordable compared to the vegas strip prices!"
Positive	"So sad it is now closed.  Sounds like the new developers struck a deal & the drive-in couldn't compete with the amount they were willing to pay for the dirt.

Going to miss the fun & memories..."
Positive	"We tried Cathy's Creamery today after hearing so much buzz and seeing all the delicious pictures. 

They did not disappoint! The store is nestled downtown with ample street parking near by. The shop itself has a few small tables, but we chose to eat our ice cream sandwiches outside. 

The homemade cookies are very generous portions and the ice cream they put on top, even more generous! They let you totally customize your ice cream sandwich. You pick the cookies you want to use (2 different if you'd like), the ice cream, and what they coat the sides in. All that for $5! 

I picked chocolate chip cookies, with banana fosters ice cream, and the Pecans to coat the sides. It was phenomenal! 

If I have any recommendations, grab lots of napkins, a bowl, and a spoon. With the heat and the big portion, it was difficult to eat. But that's a good problem in my book. These are sizable enough to share as well."
Positive	I love this place!!!! This casino has been getting a facelift for all parts of it. This bingo hall is the best of them all. The staff is great and it's nice and large plus the smoking section is enclosed. Plus they have food you can order and amazing drinks. I highly recommend this place.
Positive	"I've only had the calzones, but I've liked them well enough to eat there twice in two weeks, so that says something. 

The menu is extensive (I wonder if they're trying to do too much) and you can buy pizza by the slice, which makes this a viable option for lunch. They still seem to be having some growing pains, so service can be slow, but the folks who work there are very pleasant and friendly. 

The only thing that's missing, IMO, is garlic knots--they are something that I always think of when I think ""east coast pizza,"" and I can't get them anywhere in Champaign."
Positive	yay! so glad to have found such a great place to get very affordable facials and peels to keep my skin looking excellent.. they always run monthly specials and have even had a wonderful pumpkin facial for as low as $12.. sometimes estes are better than others, but overall its always a great experience.. i go at least once a month now.. love swina!
Positive	I went to Billy Bob's with my brother and his wife.  Everything was good.  (Bread, steak, shrimp, potato, salad, drinks, staff, waitrer, the atmosphere was casual but classy,)  They seated us quickly, attended to our needs, and took coupons that Sams Town provided.  I would recommend this place as a medium price range, enjoyable, dinning experience.
Positive	Please understand how hard it has been for me to get consistent care within a timely manner, without traveling way out of my zip code or waiting 3 weeks for an appointment. MomDoc was the quickest and easiest care I've ever gotten. They were able to get me in the same day, and had me taken care of and back out there door in 40 minutes. Another plus is that they accept a variety of Insurance, AND offer options for those who don't have it, so that you can still be seen by a doctor. The nurses and doctors were resourceful and committed, by far the best experience I've had at the doctor.
Positive	"I have read the reviews of EAT and could not wait to try it. It was easy to find, just a few blocks from downtown. We arrived at 1pm and had about a 10 minute wait which was not bad for the time of day. 

I ordered the food I had read great reviews about starting with the beignets. They lived up to the hype! They were warm and crispy on the outside with a nice fluffy center. They were served with a raspberry sauce and a wonderful vanilla mascarpone. The mascarpone was not too sweet and tasted great with the raspberry sauce. 

I ordered the shrimp and grits while my husband ordered the black bean veggie chili. Both were superb! The shrimp and grits are served with apple-smoked bacon and two fried eggs. It is the perfect combo.

I was really expecting ""not so great"" service after reading reviews of EAT. Our waiter, Justin, certainly proved those reviews wrong. He was super friendly and we never felt rushed. He kept the drinks coming and sat down to chat for a couple of minutes. I will definitely go back to EAT when I am in Las Vegas again."
Positive	Have dined here a couple of times, inside and outside. Very good food and friendly service.  I have enjoyed the food each time and with plenty for the doggy bag. Price is good for the value.BYOB is the status.
Positive	This place is great... very reasonable prices (about $30 for wash and cut... I believe the price can vary by stylist though), fun atmosphere, friendly staff. Biggest issue for me is its location -- for those of you that don't know, this is right by Pitt's campus. It can be hard to find parking. I think it's worth it though -- there is a garage near by if you're running late, and you can usually find a spot on the street if you're willing to circle the block a time or two.
Positive	"Showers and laundry are nice. The staff is very helpful and took us to our site. 
Easy to find off the highway. The sites are very close together but nice and flat so there was no problem leveling the coach.  WiFi internet is low speed and I could get better speed with my phone even though I had only one dot. My TiVo couldn't update my program schedule and my MacBookPro couldn't link up to the internet on WiFi. It might have been due to my firewall on my Mac but the TiVo's problem was due to port filtering by the campground. My windows 7 laptop could use the WiFi access. If I was staying longer than one night I'd look into the Mac issues."
Positive	"My go-to poke bowl spot in town. 

Ingredients are always fresh and service is great. 

A little bit on the pricey side but you will know where your extra pennies went. 

They are very generous with their servings and their takoyaki is one of the best. 

Highly recommend this place!"
Positive	"Let me open with: perfect service.

I've never ever had someone serve me a coffee, then tell me if its not perfect to tell him and he'd replace it immediately. And it was perfect, so no need, but how awesome a feeling is that?

My friend also got scones here, which smelled incredible and I'll probable come back for tomorrow.

Very cool/quaint vibe, nice location, and again, great coffee and service!"
Positive	This place is a good place to try out Vietnamese food. Came here twice and their food is still awesome. Drop one star for slow service. Anyway, I will still be back.
Positive	I have been coming to see Dr Gong since my son was 2 yrs old and he is now 13.  This is the only place I have ever gone that was patient and kind with my son (when getting glasses for a 2 yr old it not easy) and always strives to make sure he and I are comfortable with all the information they provide my family.  Since we all now wear glasses all 3 of my children including myself go here.  They are so very kind and truly care about the health of your eyes!  All of Dr. Gongs staff treats you like family and always greets you.  I love the great technology she has in her office and selection of frames.  If your looking for a fantastic eye doctor and pleasant staff that are knowledgeable this is the place.
Positive	"I've had the pleasure of eating this deliciousness a few times now at First Friday's and other festivals around Las Vegas. The menu is petty simple with the options of pork belly, chicken or lumpia. I also like that they give you the option to pay with cash or card. 

This most recent time I had the lumpia and pork belly combo which also comes with rice. The portion size was very generous especially for a price of $12. The wait was a little bit longer than usual, but I know they were pretty busy."
Positive	first time at Wong's Asian Cuisine, it is Hakka-Chinese cuisine.  Good prices for lunch specials.  We ordered Shrimp and Lobster sauce + rice w/soup lunch special and Chicken with Black Bean sauce + rice w/pop.  Condiments were simple, was hoping for chinese vinegar, but not available.  Wife had hot and sour soup with her lunch combo (only 1 type of soup offered), it was too spicy for her and for me as well, we ended up not finishing the soup. Shrimp and Lobster sauce was a bit more salty than we normally like.  We just barely finished our respective lunch dishes, was almost too much for us.  At the time of our visit only 1 staff member was managing the dining room, service was kinda average.  There are more dishes we are curious on tasting so likely will return again.  They do accept cash/debit, not certain on Credit cards.
Positive	These guys have some really affordable wine. What time I go Ciroc bottle in there for $14.  Everything is organize nicely on the shelves the staff always treats me with respect. It is close to my house and very convenient for me to go there frequently. I couldn't imagine going to another store to buy my alcohol.
Positive	My first time eating here and the service was superb. Very attentive with water refills, taking away plates and taking orders. Additionally, the food portions were enough to take home for almost 2 meals. I ordered the steamed clams/mussel combination for a starter for the table and then ordered the grilled salmon, with veggies. It was cooked to perfection and was easy to tear. Highly recommend. Went there for a birthday celebration as well, and they were kind enough to let us bring our own dessert and plates (I have food quite a bit of food allergies).
Positive	"Banana Republic has several locations around town, and this one located across from Boca Park in the heart of Summerlin is my personal favorite.  They have great displays of all the new product for every season.  The store also makes sure it has several sizes for almost every item and it seems to be only about half the size of the location at Caesar's.

The staff is friendly, and makes great suggestions about sizes, sales, and upcoming events."
Positive	We ate here for breakfast and very surprisingly they were not very busy. The service was phenomenal, the food delicious and the prices reasonable. The restaurant was very homie and clean! Great location.  We will definitely be back soon!!
Positive	"I really like this place. It's on the smaller side. There's a long bar area and then several tables of varying sizes. It's got a nice vibe and ambiance. And the staff super nice, friendly, and attentive!

The beer list is impressive with a lengthy list of drafts, bottles, and cans. They also have a decent list of wines and cocktails. But the beer offerings are the star here.

They have great happy deals on drinks and food from 3-6pm. It's definitely a worthy happy hour.

The food list is yummy. Duh, there's lots of pizza options. The fries are delicious. I'm particularly fond of the gorgonzola fries. The fried green beans are super tasty. The meatballs are wonderful. And so much pizza goodness. I like that they have so many different options of styles - New York, traditional, Sicilian, Chicago thin, gluten free, etc. And the toppings and combos are seemingly endless. Every single pizza on their menu sounds yummy and intriguing. You can't go wrong with any choice you make here.

So in sum, come eat here. The staff will take good care of you and you'll have lots of yum eats."
Positive	Gita did an amazing job on my eyebrows. I've had my eyebrows threaded many times by other salons , but this is the first time that it did not hurt. Gita was so gentle and took time to make sure my eyebrows were flawless before I left her chair. Thankful this place is near my house! Very clean, smells great, & excellent customer service! This will definitely be my new threading salon! Thanks Gita xoxo
Positive	I loved this place. The vibe, the staff and the menu. Was definitely cool. My friend who lives in LV decided to take me here because it was relatively close to my hotel and I had gorged enough on the amazing food on the Strip. We went into Skinny Fat and one side of the menu is a little more health focused while the other side was pure artery clogging heaven. I was a little disappointed to find out that the fryer was down. Skinny Fat didn't want me to be great. But I instead ordered a salad that was pretty amazing and a grilled chicken sandwich that was equally fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back for some truffle fries and to try out more awesome stuff on the menu.
Positive	"I initially came across L'Express in United Airlines' Hemispheres magazine, which included the restaurant in its Three Perfect Days in Montreal article. When I saw how well reviewed L'Express was on Yelp, I put it on our ""must"" list, and am so glad I did. We had a lovely lunch there during a weekend getaway to Montreal.

The restaurant itself looks straight out of a Parisian brasserie, much to my boyfriend's (a Francophile if ever there was one) delight. The bar is mahogany, the floor is done in black and white tile, and the tables are covered with white tablecloths and paper - just as one would expect to find. We sat at the back of the restaurant where we had a good look at black and white photographs depicting the restaurant and its staff for every year L'Express has been in business, and were quite impressed to see how many employees have remained at the restaurant for 5+ years.

Service is slow, but one should expect that - the French do not rush through their meals the way Americans do (which means yes, there should be significant pauses in between courses, and yes, you should have plenty of time to review the menu before being asked to make selections). If you want the waiter, signal - he's not going to hover over your table and pressure you to leave the minute you've finished your plate, thank goodness. 

We did not have a reservation but should have made one - this restaurant is very busy, and if you don't want to wait, I would recommend planning ahead.

When it comes to food, I thought L'Express held their own. I started with the courgette soup, which was creamier than I prefer, and I detected what seemed to be bacon crumbles on top, which I could have done without. That being said, it was a delicious soup, and I was more than happy to polish it off with some wonderful fresh bread. My main course, the quail, was absolutely divine. It was accompanied by a beautiful balsamic vinegar over a bed of wild rice. My boyfriend and I shared the tarte au chocolat for dessert, and while it was quite rich, we really enjoyed it.

Quite frankly, I found the L'Express experience to be quite pleasant - it was certainly the most memorable lunch I had in Montreal this October."
Positive	Si vous aimez la viande, ou mieux si vous l'adorez, vous allez être aux anges en sortant de ce restaurant brésilien. Le menu est assez simple et, du reste, presque tout le monde choisi, avec raison, Le Tourniquet, qui est la spécialité de la maison. Pour à peine 30 dollars, cette option du menu vous permettra de manger quelque 10 sortes de viandes à volonté, que les serveurs vous proposeront régulièrement à tour de rôle. En effet, les serveurs ne vous amènent pas de nouvelles assiettes, mais passent de table en table avec une viande qu'ils tiennent sur une broche et en servent à volonté. Après le dixième service, il est fort à parier que vous n'aurez plus faim, mais si vous voulez continuer à vous régaler des viandes proposées, vous pourrez continuer! De plus, en accompagnement, on sert du riz et une petite salsa qui est excellente sur les viandes les plus sèches. Un incontournable pour tous les carnivores qui s'assument !
Positive	"I agree with Joy, Maggiano's never fails. They have DELICIOUS food and the portions are HUGE.  I absolutely LOVE the Maggiano's salad... so delicious and fresh! I work at a business in South Park and Maggiano's sends us coupons every few months that are BOGO on a select lunch menu (they give you one to eat there, they give you another in a to-go box to take home!) Can't beat the deal! My favorite-the lasagna and spaghetti with meat sauce.
Also, we have had some company events at the location... we had the private room in the back with the fireplace... top notch service (they were SUPER attentive), our own bartender, and a special menu. Will we go back again? ABSOLUTELY!"
Positive	After getting a tour of Managed Pay's operation I can honestly say that I was very impressed with everything that I saw. The owner Bill is a straight shooter who seems very easy to work with. I was particularly impressed with their expertise in managing health insurance plans as well 401K's. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely recommend Managed Pay.
Positive	This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. It is a restaurant that mixes GREAT food with a diverse crowd. You see large families, small families, persons on a date, girls night out and even workforce stopping in for a meal. They have a happy hour also, but I haven't experienced that. The price is very reasonable and the staff is friendly and efficient . I was surprised to see a crowd on Tuesday since there are abbreviated hours on that day. You go once and you see why this place is so special.
Positive	Love, love this store. The Benefit brow bar has the best estheticians. My brows never looked better. The salon services for facials and manicures really leaves me feeling pampered. Everyone is so upbeat and helpful
Positive	My husband and I had a great time at this show. It was our  favorite from the entire trip. The storyline was entertaining, the songs great and the performers were outstanding and very enthusiastic. We also got a souvenir drink in a guitar shaped large cup emblazoned with the name of the show which was a nice touch. We also enjoyed the facts about the groups and the songs that were up on the back screen. Awesome experience!
Positive	"LONG WAIT + DELICIOUS RAMEN = WORTH IT
Ramen Sora is a small ramen restaurant located off Spring Mountain. They have delicious Japanese-style ramen but unfortunately, you do have to wait quite awhile.
I went with a larger party of about 7 people but we had to wait about an hour.
The food is good and the portions are pretty big. I highly recommend the Chashu Pork Rice Bowl and the Spicy Miso Ramen. The noodles are perfectly al dente and delish.
The service is good and fairly fast. They refilled our water as necessary. 
Definitely a good place to cure a hangover or get a good recovery meal. 
If you're willing to wait 30minutes-1hour, this is a decent ramen spot."
Positive	Excellent service.  Kevin is great at communicating through email and text.  He drained our pool in a timely manner.  After the pool is filled he came back to clean the filter and put in the start up chemicals.  He did not try to up sell us on any other services.
Positive	"Advanced Dermatology has been very good to my family!  The receptionist and front office staff are sweet, efficient and accommodating. The PA's are well qualified, knowledgeable and gentle.  The Doctors affiliates with the practice are proficient at MOHS surgery and follow up care.

Reviewing a business where the product is the expertise and work of those there is so different from reviewing a restaurant.  The staff there is great. Dr Khan gets high ratings from both me and my dad.  

I would recommend this practice. They have offices in Phoenix, Gilbert and Scottsdale."
Positive	Escobar's is well worth a side trip. Not only is the food very good(especially at the very reasonable prices), the atmosphere and the waitstaff are topnotch. I highly recommend the hanger steak quesedillas and the fish tacos. Don't pass it up!
Positive	"My husband and I are huge AGT fans as of this season, and we saw Mat Franco make an appearance on one of the episodes. I've seen his name around various posters and billboards in Vegas, so I was excited to see his show. 

His show is on the 3rd floor inside the Linq Hotel. The venue is not too big, and some seats even come with a table. We purchased our tickets from Tix4Tonight, and we paid for the cheapest seat, which was in the way back. The best part of our seats was the fact that we had a table. If you plan to see this show, I'd recommend sitting toward the front/middle. There is a big screen for those that are sitting in the back though. 

The show was amazing from beginning to end. My husband and I were talking about his tricks all night and could not figure out how he could do some of them. He incorporates a lot of audience participation too. 

I definitely would watch this show again because there are some tricks that I would not mind seeing again. This show is highly recommended!!"
Positive	Sushi-great ; service- great music- wtf?? Electronic dance music during dinner?? Ugh this is not Sushi Samba! Totally out of place. Annoying atmosphere to say the least. Unfortunately my wonderful dinner was accompanied by aweful club style trap music.. Very disappointing.
Positive	"In my initial review, I got a little confused with my Pho places. It's not that I reviewed the wrong place, it's that I blended the beautiful, cheap Phos of Ossington together. 

Pho Tien Thanh does not have the wonderful patio that Golden Turtle has and it's cash only. However, those things don't deter my return, as Vietnamese friends tend to agree this joint is the more traditional Pho place, and I never go wrong with their fried spring rolls (apparently not traditional) and their beautiful Pho Ga (very traditional). 

They're open for lunch and dinner, and get you in and out in a timely manner. Pho Tien are my friends."
Positive	"The food was good and I thought the prices was pretty decent too. I was told they are known for their fried chicken. I ended up getting the chicken tenders. They weren't your normal chicken tenders as in size and taste. They were huge, more like a chicken breast. Overall taste was nice. Sides were fresh and fantastic. 

Dinner was great and atmosphere was pretty cool too. Only complaint, it was extremely loud, hard to have a conversation with anyone at the table that wasn't sitting next to you. But, kinda expecting that for a Friday night. 

Will be back to entertain my family from the North. Let them try some good southern food."
Positive	"After trying only a bite of Sue Jacob's cake at a wedding open house months before the wedding, I knew that we had to put the deposit in as soon as possible to secure our wedding date for Sue to make our cake! My husband & I scheduled a time to meet with Sue for a private consultation during which she prepared samples of their most popular cakes & fillings for us to try. These included the Pink Champagne, Rich Vanilla, Marbled Chocolate & Rich Vanilla, Red Velvet Chocolate, and Lemon Poppy Seed. They were all really good but the clear winner for us was the Pink Champagne with Strawberry Cream filling!

We discussed all the details of our wedding & decided that we wanted to have a small round cake for the cake cutting & cupcakes for all of our guests. As promised, a month before the wedding, Sue followed up with a few questions to get ready for our wedding day. She asked us about our cake topper, finalized the cake & filling flavors, and confirmed other special requests. About a week before the wedding, she sent us a final confirmation e-mail with all of the details.

When we arrived to the venue on our wedding day, I was seriously in awe with the cake & cupcakes that Sue had put together for us! The small round cake & cupcakes had the flower design as I had requested and looked very elegant. Everyone who attended the wedding was in love with how the cupcakes tasted! They were pleased that the cupcakes had the surprise of strawberry cream inside and also had the perfect amount of sweetness, fluffiness, & were so tasty. I know that some guests went back and even got seconds!

Without a doubt, we made the right decision in getting our wedding cake from Sue. She was very organized with our order & made delicious cupcakes for us! I'd definitely recommend giving her a call."
Positive	Fast, friendly and professional! Don't write reviews much but really wanted to recommend this place. Name says it all. Working like bees and super friendly to customers. Great job. Thank you.
Positive	"It is really hard to find the words to describe my experience of visiting this place. Let me start with the lounge's ambiance: its interior, which includes the decor, is very modern and cozy. The orange themed lounge with it's comfortable and attractive booth seats and chairs allows you to enjoy the dining experience with your five senses! (add to this the lovely smell of chocolate, good music, and in the coming paragraph, I will discuss the taste in details ;) ) It also offers multiple plugs for those who use their laptops to study or work.

Let's go to the GOOD STUFF: THE FOOD! You cannot go wrong ordering almost anything from their delicious menu. Although this place serves popular desserts such as crepes, waffles, and chocolate pizzas, the taste that these items offer is beyond ordinary. Each item comes with a unique twist in the taste and the presentation. Furthermore, the menu reflects ""delicious"" creativity! I mean, they have nutella sushi, chocolate dome, and mouth-watering fondues! Their hot and cold beverages are also a must-try (I LOVE the C'Nuts hot chocolate with 70% of chocolate topped with marshmallows and diced almonds  ).
The taste of their chocolate is heavenly and it will surely be the most memorable and euphoric experience for your taste buds! If you prefer savory dishes, the menu has some excellent variety of choices and my personal favourite is the C'Shish Taouk. 

I can proudly say that I'm a loyal customer to this place and what keeps me returning is the consistency of food quality and excellent service. 

In sum, C'Chocolate truly redefines the chocolate eating experience and I encourage everyone reading this review to try it out ;)"
Positive	This is a great spot in downtown Pittsburgh. The tacos are great and I would say two tacos are enough per person if you split chips and queso or salsa. Unfortunately they aren't so big on drink specials or happy hour deals but their jalapeno margaritas are hard to beat!
Positive	Great service, excellent food, nice, relaxed setting- the patio is very relaxing and private from the street noise. Huge plates with more than enough to take home. Calamari appetizer was light and sauce wasn't overpowering. I had the 3-skewer entree. Opted for chicken and double steak with rice pilaf and asparagus-- simply delicious!  Rest of fam had long bone ribeye and a seafood pasta dish. Everyone said meal was excellent. Cocktails and food was served without hesitation and overall an enjoyable evening.
Positive	The people at Thick's are incredibly friendly and generous. Within less than 10 minutes they adjusted the handle bars on my bike and helped me readjust my suv bike rack so that it was on correctly. I was fully expecting to pay but he didn't charge me at all. He just offered his help and told us me come back if I needed anything else. I plan to return to buy some accessories. But in the meantime, I highly recommend this shop. Shop local people!!!!
Positive	"A bit late on this review, but i recently had a birthday dinner at Q&B and it was fantastic. We were a group of 20 and had the Parlour Room to ourselves. They have a series of family style roasts you can select from. We had the Traditional Roast Beef and Yorkshire pudding with roast veggies - fantastic. Perfectly cooked and delicious. 

What I loved about Q&B is how easy they made everything. I had been in touch with about 5 other restaurants in DT Toronto and they were all super complicated - needed Special Events contracts and Admin fees etc. Josh at Q&B totally took care of us and made everything super simple so all I had to do was confirm final numbers then show up and chow down. I highly recommend this place if you have a large group and want just really tasty comfort food with no hassles.

I've been here a few times to watch soccer and for drinks as well and had good experiences, but this last birthday feast has made me a fan. Will definitely be back."
Positive	I visited The Nest last night with a few friends, and would have to say I was rather impressed!  I love being scared, I'm obsessed with haunted ANYTHING, and Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  With that being said, the last few years choices in haunted abodes have been lacking in the fright department.  But The Nest delivered more than a handful of jumps, scares and shrieks around each bend!  Even the ghouls and goblins that roamed the dusty streets while waiting in line were entertaining to watch, and made the 45 minute wait to get in seem to fly by fairly quickly.  The special effects were pretty decent, and the actors were VERY invested in being as spooky as possible.  I was actually cornered by two very creepy, very bloody escaped mental patients that refused to let me pass.  I had to duck, cover and roll (just about), just to get to the next room!  Scary for me, and entertaining for all the friends that went with me.  The cost ($25 pp, but on Sundays only $15pp if you buy a family 4-pack) was worth it.  The only downside is the distance from Old Town, but it's well worth it to venture outside The Bubble for a night of fright!
Positive	The food and the service was top notch! Gaby was our server and she was very attentive. I ordered the chicken Marsala plate and it was probably one of the best Marsala's I have ever had. Thank you pasta shop! I will be returning!! :)
Positive	"Me & a friend visited this site on 8/26/14.  We were in Vegas for the week & had a craving for pizza while walking The Linq.  We sat at the bar (prob 10 stools total, small) & decided to split the Calabrese pizza.  It was a good snack for 2 people with a unique taste.  

What I really liked about this place was the bartenders & unique beer selections.  I did the beer flight, which had 5 beers I had never tried before & a Guinness.  It also included a cast beer, which I didn't like but it was interesting to try one for the 1st time.  Being a fan of the UFC, I was intrigued by bartender Joe.  He told me he fought 3 times in the UFC, and another female bartender was a friend of Dana White (with cell phone pics to prove it).  We all had great conversation about the sport, which was thoroughly enjoyable to me.  

Every time we visit Vegas this will be a food stop for now on.  They also have pizza by the slice at an outside window."
Positive	Very nice, clean McDonalds by a community college. The staff really tries to be helpful. Only downside is the parking lot which is kind of wedged in and on a slope but otherwise obe of the best mcdonalds around.
Positive	"Great experience from the moment we walked in. Friendly staff and principles.  

Started with Churrasquinho De Gato app... EXCELLENT!  Also the beef turnovers were delicious. Caldo Verde soup was also very good. 
Shared two entrees ... traditional seafood stew. Great flavors!  Only disappointment of the meal was their ""fried"" pork ribs. Too dry. Other than that we're looking forward to our next visit!"
Positive	Awesome awesome place! There's plenty of parking. The interior is very nicely decorated. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The food was so good. The pizza is worth the hype! And he desserts were delicious as well! I highly recommend it to anyone in the area.
Positive	"Stopped in on a Sunday morning for coffee with my girlfriend. It's in the neighborhood and she had been here before about a week or so ago. The coffee is great. It's simple, which is welcoming in a world where coffee options have become scientific beyond the point of necessary. I was talked into a breakfast sandwich and wow. Wow wow. The bread was so soft. The potatoes were also simple and great. And I don't mean simple in a pejorative way; I mean it in the best possible way. We will definitely be making this our local spot for coffee from now on. 

And hey the service was top notch. They greeted everyone with such kindness. I'm from a small town, and it felt like I was walking into the local breakfast place I'm from. I feel like this kind of neighborhood vibe is great for the West End."
Positive	Such a great place! I've been there twice now and loved it both times. I had the braised short ribs for breakfast ( amazing!) and the quinoa/kale salad with chicken for dinner (very good). They will be offering local beers soon too but, they have a nice selection of craft brews and cocktails now. Go check it out!
Positive	Amazing experience at Dickey's BBQ today!  We came in here for the first time since it's opening and the customer service from the second we walked through the door was outstanding!!   The food was so good!   We will definitely be coming back here!!   Thanks for going the extra mile to be extra kind to the kids and make them feel welcome in your restaurant!
Positive	Just had the best cheeseburger for under $6 I can remember in years. Simple bar menu, but they do it well. At least 8 beers on tap, many others in bottles. Cleaned up over old Tony Frank's, where I didn't always feel safe. Nice outdoor patio, but you hear and see belt line traffic. We kinda dug it. Will come back.
Positive	Entreprise ALWAYS takes care of me. This is the ONLY  location I go to now, even though I have an Enterprise near my office. The staff is friendly and accommodating. They can get very busy at times and the wait may be a little longer, but they make it up by excellent customer service.
Positive	I came here to pick up my race packet for the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon. Paid $8 to park at an underground lot across the street because we couldn't find any metered parking.  I was immediately impressed by the food court at this convention center even though I didn't get to eat here. There was a coffee shop and a few other fast food joints with plenty of seats.  I just kept thinking how dinky the food cafeteria is at the LA convention center is compared to this place.  Packet pickup went smoothly.  There was no traffic coming in and out of the area.
Positive	"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars...don't think they fully deserve the 4th.

Not bad but not amazing.  Fresh ingredients and interesting flavours.  I did really enjoy it.

Cons:
Limiting menu and a bit pricey for the size.  I ordered a large and to be honest it is my first time there and if it was a large, that was disappointing.  I am full but just barely."
Positive	The came out on a Sunday, professionally worked the problem in a logic sense, didnt try and upsell or be skeevy at all like A Comfort is every time. And they didnt gouge me for pricing. Fair price and fair, high quality, friendly work. Thank you!
Positive	For all you people in Las Vegas...you are lucky to have such a talented hair stylist by the name of Dean O!! He is without a doubt the best of them all.  His is talented as well as a great person as well. Will miss your services but most of all your presence.
Positive	First time in this establishment. We were seated immediately. We had a choice of sitting in the heated patio or inside, we decided inside because even though it was heated it was too cold for me. Anyway, I ordered a pomegranate margarita to start, it was delicious. Time to order, since it was late I thought I'd have something small so I ordered the turkey pot pie and my hubby a full rack of ribs. Oh my gosh when the pot pie came, instead of a normal size pot pie I got a flying saucer. Anyway, it was good and full of turkey. My hubby also loved his ribs and if you gamble with your card you can use your points to pay.
Positive	I love snow nails! Make sure to call and get an appointment to ensure they will have time to accommodate you. David does an excellent job with my acrylics and you can't see the lines in them after I've had a fill. I wish they had more gel polish colors.
Positive	"So he says, ""we have action!""
This means when we are watching the games it means something. How exciting right?! 

We're off to the races as I place my first sports bet! With D's aid! 

This betting ""thingy"" or what ""us"" girls call it is finally clear and takes on new life for me! The fog clears and I understand how to place a bet and how to read the pink card! Look out football! We have action!!

It's not Greek anymore; now I'm ready for this years football season! Cheers! So here's a deep dark secret; football's a secret passion for me! Now knowing that my potential team When a wager is placed on your favorite team now it takes on new life. It makes Sunday afternoons even more amazing and appealing with ""him!"" 

The sports book here at South Point is for those that are serious about betting! This is where the action is too! With no jokes! The staff here are amazing and are so friendly. They keep the lines moving since there is a time window that is observed when bets need to be in. 

On Sundays especially the South Point Sports Book comes alive with so many people achieving one purpose. Well maybe two purposes. The first purpose is the unspoken one; you know ""to win!""
The second; being to get that bet in on time, beer, and to the show! This week happens to be football! Huzzah!

South Point is a rare bird too! If your team wins on a tie when you cash out the winning ticket, most sports booking in Vegas will not honor a tie. In most cases the house wins in a tie. If your team wins on a tie bet; South Point honors this! So now you know where to go bet!

Plus as with most Vegas style sports betting the drinks are free while you are enjoying the game. Remember our hard working staff that brings those drinks to you too! Tip them well they will remember and take care of thee!"
Positive	"Being able to sit down and eat a short leash hot dog in their very own restaurant for the first time made the food taste even better. Their building is purple on the outside, so it's hard to miss! Always easy to find parking, we walked right in. I was comfortable, the room is simple, and the sunshine barely coming in felt cozy.

The waiter was a little bit silly; he didn't attend us right away even in a near-empty restaurant, and he forgot to get me my soda pop. He was really sweet, so I didn't really let it get to me. 

I only wish that they weren't so expensive. A custom dog is about $9. I still recommend this place! Everyone needs to try a short leash hot dog once in their life, and shame on them if their prices steer them away. Your stomach won't regret it, I promise. 

(And make sure to try their traditional soda pop - it's all part of the experience!)"
Positive	"I really like the selection of food here, not because it's super tasty though, but because it is food I haven't tried and there's plenty of new things to try.  

It was hard to find the items posted on yelp on the actual tablet menu.  For example, the mixed beef thinly sliced.  Perhaps it's because there's so much to choose from and so many sub-menus.  I did look under ""beef"" appetizers, cold food, but still, couldn't find it.  Anyway, they're pretty patient with you looking through the menu.

What I liked about this place is the soup/noodles and hot sauce varieties.  I want to come back to try the cold dishes.  However, what I did not like was that the chef special was basically just chicken neck, no meat, all bones for a small in the amount of $18.00.  The tablet says $13.99, but then it takes you to a new window, asking you if you want the small or the large.  The chicken did not have lotus on it, which was different from what I see on yelp.

I'd come back because the items on the menu are different from that at a traditional Chinese restaurant."
Positive	Love Secrets! Clean and friendly! Jessica Armbruster is an exceptional stylist who takes time to listen and achieve your desired look. On top of being a great hairdresser, she is a great person too.
Positive	This is THE best buffet in the world without a doubt. I absolutely love it. I recommend going towards the end of lunch so that you are charged the lunch rate, but are still there when they bring out the dinner dishes.
Positive	"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.

We both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a ""10"" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted ""American 10"" or ""Indian 10"". After finding out that ""American 10"" = ""Indian 5"", I was steered toward the ""Indian 7"" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).

It was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip!"
Positive	There's a few things on the menu (burger, chicken sandwich, fish sandwich, salads) and they do them very well.  The chips are a great side or app to share and the fish and chicken were very good.  I don't know which I'd go with next time but I'd definitely reorder.  If it's a nice day there's more outdoor seating than indoor.  This is the type of place that makes the area great.  You could rotate between here and the spots across the street and never get bored of it.
Positive	"5 + Stars for the Golden Gate. By far, my favorite casino to gamble at downtown.
This is an intermate casino offering less than twenty tables.
It is on the older side and you just know it belongs to old school Las Vegas.
I spent 5 hours here playing blackjack. I started at 3PM and finished around 8. The dealers change over around 6 to dancer/dealers in very little clothing. I will say aside from the clothing they were all friendly, helpful and down to make sure all had a good time. 
The cocktail waitresses make the rounds oftened enough that your never wanting a drink (although I suggest you order bottled beer as I know the liquor is water down like no one's business).
They also have a great little deli in back with 99 shrimp cocktail and really great sandwiches.
Love you golden gate!!!"
Positive	Remember to use your phone number to earn points and, ultimately, free ice cream! Fast service and the lobby is usually very clean. Although, customers could do a better job if pushing in their chairs when they vacate the seat, but that's not CSC's fault, that's just lazy and inconsiderate customers.
Positive	Fun place. Consistent as chain restaurants go. One problem: I was in there late one night with a friend and we both asked if they had any hot wing challenges. We were just curious ya know. Turns out there is. 12 blazing traditional in under six minutes. So we tried it. I completed the challenge and was told that I would get a free shirt. I left my address and contact info expecting my shirt in the coming weeks. Two months later and no shirt. And that is my only complaint. That won't stop me from frequenting this establishment though. It is always clean, the food is good, and most of all the staff is friendly and fast.
Positive	"AMAZING...
I took my car in for a quick fix a while back and Artur didn't charge me a dime for it. I was referred by a friend. My car needed a dab of paint on it because it had a scratch. A year later I got into a big accident and that's when I remembered this shop. Without a doubt I came back, my insurance was trying to take my car else where but I refused. Most people think you have to take your car to where the insurance MAKES you go but I had no regrets taking my car back to Artur who was very happy to see me again.
Thank you APLUS AUTO BODY!!
Won't trust anywhere else!"
Positive	"I was in town for a conference and taxi'd straight from the airport.  Heidi was fantastic and my hair never looked better once she was finished.  In fact it looked great for 4 days of meetings and three nights of parties.  She called a taxi for me as she was finishing up and it arrived as I was paying.  One of the most efficient places in Vegas.  

I've had blow outs in Chicago and Heidi's work is about as good as it gets!  I will go back every time I'm in Vegas and even with the taxi fare it is half the price of same service in a hotel salon on the strip."
Positive	"It was really really good......a little hard to follow but still so amazing. I saw Le Reve 2 years ago it was almost as good as that.

still i don't know how they do it......we had amazing seats and the 1.5 hours definitely flew by.

The stage rotates anf flips and there are people still on it and the costumes and makeup are just amazing  touches my designers heart

if you are contemplating seeing this just do it you wont regret it."
Positive	"Authentic machaca and homemade chorizo. I wish they did papas with the meal because that is the way I have eaten this breakfast plate for 30+ years. From Fresno to San Diego and now Buckeye/ Verrado Arizona. 
    This is a hole in the wall. It is in an industrial part of town and very easy to get to. Restaurant was almost full and we were the only gringos in there. Very nice family has run this for about 20 years according to Angel. And I took a picture of his grandmother back in the kitchen. I think she thought I was loco. 
     Their homemade green salsa is absolutely off the hook. The red salsa is very good but you really get the feel of the Sonoran style in the green salsa. Guys coming in during lunch looked like very hard working people. We like going to places like this.
Oops almost forgot the homemade corn tortillas. YUMMY."
Positive	"I had a great experience at the Wind store today.

Honestly, the store was a madhouse when I got in. There were over a dozen customers inside and 4-5 customer service agents in the store.

But, I waited only around five minutes to talk to someone, and in a little over 15 minutes I was set up with a new account, with the plan I wanted (at 50% off for 6 months) and a new phone (on WindTab). 

Daniel S was super helpful, gave me all the pertinent info I needed, answered my questions, and hooked me up with a phone number I might actually be able to remember. Everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable, so that's a plus.

That is what customer service should be like. 

Overall, I was really satisfied with the customer service I recieved, and so far the coverage has not been an issue (for me). I haven't seen ""Wind AWAY"" at all yet. Surprisingly enough, I can use my new phone in places I couldn't use my Rogers phone (like... the elevator in my office building...)"
Positive	This chipotle is honestly the best one in Pittsburgh aside from the one in market square. My boyfriend decided to drop by for me after he got off of work and he didn't have his wallet with him. I asked him if he would go inside and ask if they could take the card numbers over the phone, so he did. Unfortunately they said it was against their policy but instead said that they would take care of the meal for free. This honestly was so nice as we eat there often and it was just such a nice gesture! Thank you to the manager who offered the meal for free, it is greatly appreciated!
Positive	"After being told I had a ""possible"" blown head gasket by an automotive place down the street, I decided to take my car to another place, My Mechanic. I was from California, I had my Mom, and two toddlers with me, no husband, and my car kept overheating! When I walked in, Bonnie was great, she instantly calmed me down! Then Brandon walked in and told me he would check it out! After less than an hour (which in that time I was able to enjoy a massage from their massage chair available in their waiting room), he pulled my car up to the front and walked in and said,"" it was just your radiator cap!"" I could have kissed him! This place knows cars, Brandon is an amazing mechanic, he is a troubleshooter! Don't try your luck anywhere else in Vegas for your car troubles! This place is true to their name, My Mechanic!"
Positive	If you get the chance to train with Punong Guro TJ Cuenca, do it! I just trained with TJ in the Philippines recently as well as in Las Vegas. He is a first rate master of Filipino Martial arts and Knife Throwing. His wife Melody is a World Champion Knife Thrower and great teacher! You can learn knife throwing basics in just a couple of hours, she is that GOOD! They are parents and know how to teach kids, as well as special forces, elite Police and Military Combatives. Take the time to visit them and see what they do and bring the whole family!
Positive	Craig is great！I love my new hair cut. He did it fast in about 30 mins and all done！They are very busy in this holiday season. The owner is very nice too！
Positive	My husband and I went here for his birthday dinner since we were in town. The menu is impressive. So much to choose from! Taking a shot of the menu won't do justice. We ordered the Orange Blossom, Spicy Tataki roll, & Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice. All were so tasty! The Orange tasty was the one we favored most and it was recommended.
Positive	I received services from Barefoot Acupuncture well over a year ago. Don Matesz is an exceptional practitioner. He performs very thorough assessments throughout treatment along with providing patients with education. Acupuncture, herbal teas and dietary changes(advised by Tracy) brought relief to my women's health issue that I suffered severe pain with for years and 4 different OBGYNs could not help me alleviate the symptoms, all suggesting aggressive surgery. Today, I am still enjoying good overall health, especially with continued plant based dietary changes. This clinic is outstanding!
Positive	"Awesome venue for a fight.  Attended the Khan-Alexander fight here on Sat. Dec. 13th.

Ill agree that theres not a bad seat in the house.  Our tickets were in sec 7 row S and we had a great view.  Noticed a half empty row right next to the ring in section 13 a couple rows up from the floor (ours were facing the corner of the ring) and were not hassled by the usher to show our tickets when we went down there.  A couple other dudes also snuck down and the usher did notice but simply told them to move once the folks who actually had tickets got there (which I thought was pretty cool).  The seats were almost too good!  A little too close and the ropes were blocking some of the action so we moved up about 10 rows where we were about 12-15 rows from the floor and our view was PERFECT.

If youre going to attend a fight here and are worried (like I was) of having a good view, trust me, you will have a good view no matter where you sit.  I bet you'll even have a decent view from the upper sections (which were curtained off for this event).

I would post a picture but we all know phone pics look much further away for events than they do in real life so I decided not to.

Entering was a breeze.  Exiting was a breeze.  Mind you, the venue at maximum capacity is around 17k and it was about half that for the event I attended.  

Workers here were extremely polite.  

Bathrooms were huge (no lines) and clean.  No lines at the concession stands on the night we went either. They allow you to walk in drink in-hand and have a table set up outside with plastic cups for you to pour your drink into and a trash can to dispose of the bottle (no bottles allowed).

When leaving, I would HIGHLY recommend taking the monorail.  Its just outside the entrance to the arena and hardly anyone rode it to get out of the MGM after the fight.  We got to Paris to have dinner 15 mins after leaving the arena.

Also, re-entry is allowed. You just have to make sure they scan your ticket when leaving."
Positive	"3.5 Round Up to a 4

So when is the best time to enjoy an excellent ""Chef"" special chirashi/sushi/sashimi at Yutaka or most of the Japanese restaurants around town? The answer is no one knows... not even the Sushi Chef as it is really depends on the shipment that arrives everyday. 

I was all psyched up to enjoy one of the Chef Special during my visit to Yutaka. And sadly after talking to the chef telling me that's not any fresh and unique fish available... I ended up just ordering a normal Sushi Platter. 

Sushi Lunch ($19) has a good selection of fresh fish which I really enjoyed. The only think maybe the spicy roll which was overdosed with spicy mayo.

I like the spacious and comfortable seating. 

I came right at 11:30 am when the restaurant opened to beat the lunch rush. By 12:30 pm, the place was full and seemed like they need more wait staff. So come here either for early or late lunch!"
Positive	"Holy ISH, Batman!!! Hank's is AWESOME!!!

Did business lunch here at 1 p.m.a few weeks ago... YUM!

I had heard of it before on food boards, Yelp, etc. but had yet to try it for myself or even figure out WHERE it is!

It's tucked away down on the Southernmost block of Church Street, on the east side. Cute!

I can't comment on the atmosphere/decor, because they were renovating when I was there. It was bare, lights were off, construction noise, etc...

The food, however, as well as the service, was FANTASTIC!

The fries are wonderful. They use the best ingredients, especially in terms of coffee beans, breads and cheeses, and everything tastes clean and healthy (yes, even my deep-fried frites).

Did I mention the coffee? It's great. REALLY great.

I can't wait to go back for brunch!"
Positive	"The Venetian is always a great place to stay. They have large rooms (love the extra little living room), comfy beds and FANTASTIC bathrooms. They haven't updated their look in a while but it works for them and everything is super clean and well kept. 

The casino is massive so there's something for every type of gambler. There's also tons of food which I love cause I'm a fattie. If you have a large group hit up the Grand Lux Cafe. Their menu is insane. They have everrrrything so it's a great place to grab some relatively quick and cheap food when you have no idea what you want to eat.

Side note: Lavo sucks. Small and crappy. Crowd is hideous."
Positive	"Have been here a few times and this is the great review I have left.  It gets fairly busy here but patio is open seating and we were able to find a table within 15 minutes.  The patio/bar area is very large so you shouldn't have a problem and there is a nice seating area around a fire pit as well that just adds to why sitting outside is the fall is the way to go.  

While everyone was friendly my only grip was that service was a bit slow, but it wasn't anything that ruined the night.  We ordered our meal and while mine was excellent, ( steak cooked a perfect medium-rare ) with excellent mixed vegetables.  My girlfriend ordered a sirloin and she wanted it medium-rare, but it was clear once she cut into that is was very rare.  While she did her best to eat around the rarest parts we did mention this to our server.  

This next part is why I'll come back.  While they offered to re-cook her steak she graciously declined since we had to leave.  The waitress then came back and had offered us two free desserts as a small consolation prize.   While it was incessant we were more than pleased with the service provided and will have no reservation about ever coming back."
Positive	Pretty good sushi. I always take out so I don't know about the service. Love the Hamachi and Salmon Kama, baked mussels are great. Sushi seems pretty fresh for AZ standards.
Positive	"This place is wonderful. Incredibly affordable, large portions, delicious, and the staff makes you feel like family. They almost always through in free extras like free wontons for the wonton soup, an extra egg roll, or whatever else they have. I love that you get a free crab puff, egg roll, fried rice, and barbeque chicken as an ADDITION to your dinner or lunch entrée (because I'm a glutton like that). Everything I've had here is pretty good. I really liked the orange chicken, the egg rolls, the wonton soup, chow mein, beef and broccoli, and the vegetable delight. 

I've ordered take-out twice and went to pick up once. Although this spot isn't much for ambiance, the inside is still clean and respectable. It's definitely a good place to check out if you're wanting tremendous amounts of Chinese food for a very low price!"
Positive	"Today I went downtown to check out the new Holt Renfrew. I carefully stepped through the construction zone that is still TD and then into a burst of lights and candy coated colours that make up the best department store ever. I had reached fashionista heaven. 

It was three floors of amazing, and I immediately started identifying with Becky Bloomwood from the Shopaholic series. There they were, all of my favourite designers' new collections calling my name: Dolce and Gabbana, DSquared, Coach, everything a girl's heart could possibly want. My credit cards ached just looking at the storefront but my mouth was working overtime, drooling all over the dresses. Below the woman's ready to wear lay a floor full of accessories and the floor above was full of fashionable menswear. 

Even though I was such a hot mess (reaching heaven can do that to a girl), the staff were very courteous. After the initial courtesy check in each section they would stay within eyesight but not obtrusively so, and they were quite approachable. 

The Holt Renfrew in Calgary (the flagship store) is a beautiful haven for fashion lovers and rich people alike. If you've taken up recessionista chic, it's a good place to soak up some eye candy. And if you don't understand why someone would pay more than $50 on a shirt, steer clear."
Positive	Brought two of my coworkers here for lunch today and as usual Ian was there to smile and greet us. This is seriously one of the best subways I've been to and the new coupons really make it more affordable to come in more often. The coupon that came in the mail was $5.99 for any footlong and nobody can beat that price with a 20 foot pole!!!! My coworkers got two 6 in meals for $9.99! Cheers to you subway for making the cost more reasonable and Ian for always being kind and professional!
Positive	So pizza has never quite been my thing until my taste buds came across Craft 64s! The fig, caramelised onions and cheese pizza was an instant hit. Then the fennel sausage pizza...simply a perfect  balance of flavours. We were 3 dinners and 2 pizzas was ample. I chose to have a Perry Cider with my slices. The perfect choice for my palette! Joseph (or Jose) was our server and he took great care in making sure we were enjoying ourself. His knowledge of wines and beers was most impressive. He was truly passionate about what he was doing. All the draft beer is local and my Perry Cider came from Prescott. I couldn't fault a thing. Can't wait to return
Positive	"Wonderful, small, family run little restaurant. I went in the middle of a Friday afternoon. No one else there. I had a delightful conversation with the young Venezuelan owner as he prepared my medium sized plate of ceviche. I selected the ""melange;"" a mix of octopus, fish, and shrimp. Perfectly done. Wonderful favors, and just enough spice. I asked for something on the spicy side, so there is clearly room for individual tastes here. 

The corner location is located in a nice little neighborhood that straddles St. Laurent. Very homey little place. It seats perhaps 30 people, max. Very reasonably priced too. I thinkable they don't have alcohol, though I'm not sure. 

A great spot, though. If you love ceviche, as I do, you can't go wrong here!"
Positive	This is my second time staying at the Venetian and I have to say that both times have been an excellent experience. Both times I have stayed in the Bella Suites. I have stayed at Cesar's Palace and the Venetian suites are a lot more affordable, spacious, and they are just beautiful.  I did read some of the yelp reviews which many complained about the renovation. Once I arrived I requested a room away from the renovation and they gave me a renovated room!  I did not even notice the renovation that was going on. All the staff are very polite and helpful. I will definitely be returning. They have free WIFI, which is not the best, however it gets the job done.  Cesar's Palace only allows 2 devices to be used.
Positive	Amazing service! As soon as we walked in we were greeted. My fiancé and I came here after going to Men's warehouse to look for a tux. Jessica was the rep who assisted us and showed us all the options to choose from. Their selection is much broader for rentals and they offer selections that are higher end than other rental locations. I would highly recommend this location.
Positive	Haven't been to this noodle place for long time.  The quality is still the same!  Amazing wonton and egg noodle.  We ordered a side beef too, very tender.  Highly reco!
Positive	This is some of the best NY style pizza in Charlotte. Took me 5 years to find a good pizza joint. This ranks right up there with Upstate Pizza, but NY Pizza is closer to my house. Highly recommend to anyone that appreciates a real NY style pizza!
Positive	"I was so excited to know that Guschlbauer opened their first North American location here in Toronto! I missed the chance to try these Austrian quarter cheese buns when I was in Hong Kong. So, I couldn't miss this opportunity during their soft opening with a 20% off promotion. Their cute little shop is conveniently located on Yonge and Bloor and is hard to miss with their bright yellow signage. Currently, they offer the original, chocolate, strawberry and mango flavour for their cheese buns, fresh fruit slush and a few flavours for cream puffs.

As I was deciding what to order at the counter, I could see their chef filling each quarter bun with loads of cream cheese in front of me. That tells me they really don't skim out on their fillings in their buns.  And seeing all the fresh mangoes on 'display', I just had to try out their mango cheese bun. To my expectation, it was filled with creamy mango flavoured cream cheese and mango chunks. The taste wasn't overly sweet which I especially like. The bun was also soft and spongy and actually not hard and dry like I thought it was. I also enjoy the fact that I could eat these cheese buns 2 ways. I could either reheat them in the microwave for 10 seconds to have an oozing lava effect or refrigerate them for a bit to get an ice cream cake kind of result. 

The staff took some time to explain to me the origin of their recipe and that they were still trying to fine tune their products and services before they officially launch.I appreciated their sincerity and commitment on their new business and as a start up, I think they deserve a lot of encouragement to be able to survive in such a competitive Toronto market. And for this reason, I gave them a 5-star. I hope to see them perfect their cheese buns and I'd be willing to come back and try out other flavours and their cream puffs."
Positive	Was at Comicon yesterday and we enjoyed the event. Event was organized and they had enough security during the event. I will be back next year for sure! Place is nicely kept bathrooms were clean and they are everywhere. Love that we have this amazing  place here in Phoenix when temps reach records high and are still able to enjoy these kinds of events with air condition atmosphere.
Positive	They took fantastic care of my car - communication and customer service were top notch, something I've found lacking from other mobile detail companies.  I will definitely be a return customer.
Positive	First time ordering through grub hub the other morning. Breakfast delivery was a godsend!! We ordered a waffle, bagel and a coffee! Delicious coffee. The waffle smelled the house all day! Great food. It got here pretty fast! Genius idea to deliver breakfast!! Some mornings you just need delivery!!
Positive	"Bruschetta heaven! Postino Arcadia is a romantically decorated and very cute Italian wine bar in that I was dying to try during my short trip to Phoenix.

FOOD: 7/10
SERVICE: 7/10
ATMOSPHERE: 10/10

FOOD: 
+ Smoked Salmon with Pesto ($15 for 4 flavors): Yum! This was really great cause I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and pesto. It wasn't particularly fresh or populated with salmon though. 

+ Almond Hummus & Tomato Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was delicious as well! I highly recommend this if you like hummus.

+ Salami with Pesto Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was okay! If it was up to me, I would've gotten another order of the Smoked Salmon with Pesto. There was only one piece of salami, and it was very mediocre.

+ Warm Artichoke Spread ($15 for 4 flavors): SO CHEESY. I can't particularly handle cheese, so I didn't like this at all. I do not recommend this if you don't love cheese.

+ Turkey Panini: Good enough! Nothing spectacular but it was tasty.

+ Brussel Sprouts Salad: Not what I was expecting AT ALL. It was mostly regular salad leaves with some brussel sprout leaves at the bottom. I was definitely expecting whole brussel sprouts or at least more of it. Not impressed with this.

SERVICE:
Decent service. They were attentive and refilled my water a lot but weren't very friendly.

ATMOSPHERE:
So cute! Very romantic. We sat on the outside patio where there was mist to keep us cool from the 107 degree Phoenix heat. Lots of lights and lush greenery. Good date spot.

Overall, would recommend it purely for the ambiance and bruschetta options. Not the freshest or best food I've had but pretty good for Phoenix restaurants."
Positive	This preschool is a play based NAYEC accredited preschool. A national accredited preschool is very important and hard to find in AZ. The accreditation process is tedious and they have to follow so many very important guidelines day in day out to keep this accreditation and boy does it help with developing these little minds. This accreditation hasn't lapsed ever. The management, teachers and instruction are top notch. Parents are well informed on monthly, weekly, daily and hourly curriculum through the monthly class lesson plans, monthly thought provoking articles about child development as well as a monthly newsletter from the director, Mindy. You also get formal monthly class emails from your child's teacher as well. Most of the teachers and the admin have been there well over 20 years. They assess your child and have parent conferences 2 times a year. This is vital, with the literacy, language, cognitive puzzles and games, creative expression, circle time activities, as well as fine and gross motor activities the kids do daily, the teachers are able to see a pattern in your child's play and give you advise right away if an area needs more attention or may be a red flag. This preventative way of teaching and informing the parents daily weekly, or if you wait for your child's conference is so vital and can be an early intervention strategy. It helped me with my oldest son's needs greatly.  It's a nurturing environment and runs very smoothly for parents and children. I have 4 boys and 3 of them have been students here, the oldest is on his way to Kindergarten now but the second, third and fourth children will be there again this year. I have nothing but amazing things to say about what this school does for learning through play. Also if you can stay for an entire day, you will be so in love with the entire staff. Chapel time with Pastor Dave and Teacher mindy and her church puppets is darling. The motor perception class (PE) With coach wings is very well thought out as well. The teachers and the friends, the art and the play. So special. These kids are growing socially and emotionally so much every day. The teachers are passionate and the families are grateful. That is a perfect combination for success for the school and the families. The play areas are so well kept. The inventory of learning toys is so amazing. My boys are so passionate about learning and enjoy school so much from this preschool alone. I'm soon grateful for this school.
Positive	"I ordered a few shirts from them and one of them was incorrect even though the packing slip noted the correct shirt.  

I called the number on the packing slip and got through immediately. the person on the other end was clear, professional and in ""solution mode"".  -- Amazed?  It get's even better.  She was actually in a position to fix my problem. Done and done. 90 seconds out my life. 

The shirts are of better quality than their competitors (I did upgrade to the Hanes Beefy T's which is not an option with other companies). As for the lettering... this stuff always seems fragile to me but time will tell.  If I feel that the wear is pre-mature as some reviewers have noted I will update this review but at this time I am very happy with the product and service.

(This was not a custom order)"
Positive	"Excellent service, staff is super nice, we were seated right away on a busy Sunday breakfast /lunch time. The restaurant is clean and they turn tables quickly. Our server, Bette, was attentive and fast with the drinks and checking to see if everything was ok 
We ordered pulled pork breakfast burritos and southern chicken breakfast biscuits. Wow, there was so much food and everything was excellent."
Positive	"Zeke's staff has more ink than most Bic factories.  Their pierced faces are riddled with more holes than a box of cheerios.

They are also the friendliest, most knowledgeable, and passionately enthusiastic baristas of any cafe I've ever been to.  They know every facet of the menu, and make personalized recommendations to fit any discerning palette. 

The inside is cozy, and all the drinks are the highest quality.  The premium snacks and indulgently sinful sweets are all delicious.  

Most coffee shops staff and customers wouldn't have had the dedication to raise over $20K on IndieGoGo, but Zeke's community is different.  Don't be scared, come and taste the love!"
Positive	"Salon Four8Zero is a relaxing, beautiful place to get your hair done by some really talented people. Brent is unbelievably good at cutting, coloring, and styling medium to long hair (which you can see from Four8Zero's posted pictures), and that I realized when I saw how great my sister's hair looked every time she came home from a visit, so I knew I had to check the place out.

I found that Brent is also equally talented with very short hair (mine is usually a longish pixie cut). He is able to cut and color it so that not only I am in love with it, but I get compliments everywhere I go. This salon will be my new go-to place for sure. 

(Sorry for the awkward mirror selfie; gotta get good hair pics when I get the chance)"
Positive	"My husband and I went to Fred's on a Wednesday night around 6pm and the place was packed.  Luckily, we got the last of two tables in the back. 

There's nothing extravagant about the décor as it's just your typical neighborhood sports bar but it's very inviting and the staff are extremely friendly.  I have to repeat, it's not fancy on the inside - don't expect it to resemble a Firkin pub.  There were lots of TVs around showing all the games and good music playing in the background.

The menu was pretty extensive for a local joint but, I've heard so much about the wings being one of the best in 'Sauga, that I had to try them.  We ordered the following:  ten suicide wings, grilled calamari, muscles in a tomato sauce and a pint of Keith's each.  The beer came quickly but it was a bit of a wait for the rest of the food; however, all three dishes arrived hot, fresh and at the same time.  

Let me tell you, the wings were out of this world!  I don't even remember the last time I had wings that good.  They were big, juicy, so crispy on the outside and cooked and flavored to perfection - no breading or any of that guck!  As I said, we ordered suicide but it was more like a hotter wing but, again, so much flavor.

I heard a lot of good things about the grilled calamari but, in my opinion, I thought it was just okay.  The calamari was a bit overdone and I didn't care for the bread crumb topping because, as it reached room temperature, it soaked up the olive oil, thus making the dish oily.  It was kind of pricy too; around $15 for a relatively small plate but the lemon, garlic and olive oil sauce was really delicious - next time I'd try the fried calamari though.

Nothing to complain about when it came to the muscles - good portion and good quality seafood and I recall the dish not being too expensive.

I should mention that the beer was spot-on too - nice, cold and refreshing.

I do have to stress that the wings were, honestly, superior to some of the best places - they were like what you'd get in Buffalo, NY.  They were seriously that good!  We try not to eat wings too much but now I'm afraid I'm going to be craving them all the time.

Anyway, if you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try.  Bottom line: friendly service, affordable and good quality food."
Positive	John is one of the good guys out there.  He's a unique professional who has the combination of knowledge and desire that is needed to provide quality service in the mortgage business.   I highly recommend John - for both borrowers and Realtors!
Positive	"Best service from any repairman in a long while.  Kevin showed up in the earlier part of the 8-12:00 window, which I really appreciated, repaired two ceiling fans, and was gone in less than  half hour. Of interest to me was a comment made by another repairman from a different company--""you ought to just get a new fan.""  Not needed!  Kevin replaced the capacitor and the fan works fine.  And, reasonably priced.  I will absolutely use them again."
Positive	We reserved a stretch limo made to accommodate eight people for four passengers, so it was a very comfortable ride. Our driver Jim was amazing! We met at the airport easily and he took us around Las Vegas for a few hours until we could check into the hotel. He took us everywhere we wanted to go without us even having to ask! So friendly and helpful, made the experience very memorable! Would book with this company again without hesitation.
Positive	"Anthony and his team are professionals at moving.  They take care of your belongings the way you would want. They work hard with very few breaks. I will be hiring them again for part 2 of my move!

Anthony thank you!"
Positive	I am obsessed with everything about this place. The food and quality is outstanding. Pricey, but I have no problem paying for good food. The rice bowls are awesome and perfect for lunch! I visit a few times a week since the school I teach at is just around the corner. Great to have healthy food options close and not be bogged down by crummy food in the middle of the day. Thanks for taking my orders over the phone and always having them ready for me to pick up!
Positive	"Food: I was a frequent afternoon tea go-er when I lived in the Bay Area, so was eager to find a quality afternoon tea location to take my visiting mom for a belated Mother's Day tea.  We had the Traditional Afternoon Tea with Golden Assam ($40/pp). I loved all the little sandwiches and sweets, more than I expected, since I'm used to the traditional presentation. But these were VERY tasty and satisfied the expected flavors, such as egg salad, ham, and scones and sweets along with surprising favorites like the curry chicken cone with asian pear (divine!) and the citrus dessert (yellow one). 

The big fail was the sweet item that was chocolate/blackberry cake, which I expected to like, but it just tasted terrible. They really need to fix this one! But everything else was FANTASTIC!! I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and presentation and it exceeded my expectations, especially after reading other reviews. 

The Golden Assam tea was the perfect accompaniment as it was English Breakfast tea-like and what I'm used to. It was hard to pick amongst all their teas and ice tea selections! I took the local honey home to use on toast and it was SO DELICIOUS. I need to buy some local honey!

Ambiance: Beautiful area set off the lobby, with floor to ceiling windows/views and lovely couches and tables. We got there right when it opened (first seating) and lucked out by getting the best location front and center in front of the window.

Service: Superior as one would expect from Mandarin Oriental. Our polished server was top notch and professional. She explained the tea service, tea offerings, items when they arrived, and checked in frequently but not too frequently. 

Price: At $40/pp this is more than reasonable and practically a steal compared to the Garden Court at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco ($68/pp), which is my standard and stick to compare against.

Location: In the beautiful Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

Tip: Initially when I was researching afternoon tea places, I could not decide between here and Petrossian Bar. Thinking that Petrossian was more traditional, we went there first, but I was disappointed in the low quality service (we were an afterthought) and environment (view of the casino). If you are trying to decide between the two, Mandarin Oriental is WAY more superior in EVERY WAY. I will be returning!!"
Positive	Bought a 90 minute deep tissue massage for my boyfriend and I off of Groupon and what an amazing decision that was! Went yesterday and already today my back and shoulders are feeling better than they have in weeks! Jesse did and amazing job and I'll definitely be going back as much as I can! Best deep tissue massage I've ever had!!!
Positive	"I love meals where we can go ""sharesies"" on things and Pigeonhole is perfect for this. The serving sizes are on the smaller side as people have noticed but the quality is definitely up there, I really enjoyed everything we tried from the charred cabbage to the lamb tartare, so tasty! We were basically licking the absolutely adorable dishes. They use the cutest china and I love the assorted different dishes everything is served on. Their cocktail menu looks tasty but I stuck to wine when we went."
Positive	I gave this restaurant five stars before. The only reason I gave it a four star now its because there new bathrooms at the new location needed some attention.  It took longer to get our order this time.  They didn't ask us if we wanted the tab split knowing there were two couples. Made it akward when we had to split the tab.  They need to hire another waitress even though the one they have now is pretty good but she might need some help on the busy hours now.  The food is still the same! WONDERFUL!  Love it.  They did raise a couple dollars here and there but the porpotions where still the same.  We will always hit this restaurant we just hope they keep improving for the better.
Positive	"This was a really cool show!  Not just because I saw some booby.  I mean this show is very artistic, and the light effects were very very cool.   I wouldn't say this was an erotic show - no standing salute from me - but if you are the type than can appreciate the female body and like a good show then this is for you!  If you are expecting a lap dance, well... you're not on Industrial Road.

FYI... my fiance was the one that bought the tix and encouraged me to go!!   She rules.  Awesome."
Positive	I love this place. It gives me an understanding of how things used to be. The owner goes out of his way to know everyones name. The food is outstanding and comes in portions that the body is SUPPOSED to intake at one seating. Great friendly atmosphere. Even if the food weren't so amazing, I'd go just to hang out with Jin (owner). Two thumbs and one big toe up!!
Positive	Much improvement in customer service after my last encounter. My husband really wanted a poke bowl and I had no other choice than to come here for his request. The girl creating my husband's food was attentive and friendly.  I'm glad I had a good experience this time around.
Positive	Stopped in for dinner while in Tempe for spring training.  Choose Serrano's based upon Yelp feedback and glad we did.  7 of us in our party and everyone was pleased with their meal.  Loved the spinach enchiladas!
Positive	I always go to the Scarborough town center ! It's a nice please lots of different shops. The food court is big but the thing that I don't like is that there's a lot of Indian Food in the food court ! But over all it's a nice please especially this store called Caribbean Queen these sell amazing food it's really good
Positive	They came to our assisted living facility and did a great job of displays and information. The residents loved it and can't wait for them to come back so they can get Christmas gifts.
Positive	"I was in search for another primary care doctor, since ours left his practice after 12 yrs of top knotch care. My family and I were, of course, devastated. I happened to see this medical facility and I called and made my 1st appointment. I am giving 4 stars because it was my initial visit and I haven't really gotten to know the doctors and staff. The initial visit was good and the staff and doctor were very friendly. I was very pleased with how quickly the ""first time patient"" paperwork went. It was all electronic. Also, if you are female, you can get your annual (woman) exams, too. Look forward to building a new relationship here."
Positive	"Wow! Is all I can say, these little Asian gals rock!  (I can say that because I'm half Chinese).  He he. Seriously, I'm a freak about massages and LOVE to get them whenever I have the $$.  Was skeptical at first because of the value, you immediately  think, whats the catch?  This place is clean as a whistle (the bathroom was immaculately clean) and very relaxing what with the soft spa music, water fountain and lighting.  The gals are strong and gave us firm massages, not wimpy ones which annoy me. The BF and I booked it after Yelping and read all the reviews. 
I recommend that you wear a two piece bathing suit ladies, and men should wear board shorts/swimsuit and a t shirt as well.    I wish they had told me to dress differently because it isn't like a regular massage table. They massage you in reclining chairs and the massage area is not completely private so you are clothed. 
I absolutely would go back over and over again.  Awesome!!  Enjoy!"
Positive	This place has food way better than nandos chicken in heartland area. Ive been coming to this place almost 2 years and gets better every time. I suggest the family platter so you can try all the things they offer. I suggest to call for pickup for faster service.
Positive	"My little family and I went to eat at Borracha this last Wednesday and saw something that made me feel the need to write a review. As a former waitress in the restaurant industry, I noticed something very familiar to me. It seemed as if our Server Melayna was already busy with a full section and got sat with a few extra tables all around the same time. This for me was something I had to personally learn to deal with and not stress over, even being seasoned in the restaurant life for nearly two decades. Needless to say, the worst thing that can happen to you is when you are already feeling the pressure and BAM, you look up to see 2-3-4 additional tables, wondering where they came from and how long they had been there. But this is where it gets interesting. Where most any server would become overwhelmed and stressed out to the point where you almost shaking from the pressure of all the eyes looking at you to refill their drinks, placing in their additional orders, or requesting seconds for dessert, our server took the challenge head on. She placed herself into 6th gear as we call it back home, and took me by surprise. I expected our dinner to be prolonged to say the least, by the amount of customers as I said before, but that simply was not the case. Melayna was present at our table whenever we needed her. Our drinks, nor our salsa chips did not see the bottom of their containers, and her presence at the table was also uninterrupted by the influx of customers. From one waitress to another, she more than faired out of being in the weeds and saw herself through. Don't think your efforts went unnoticed Melayna! 

It goes without saying, I appreciated the efforts of our server and the restaurant as a whole. I want to also commend Borracha for hiring such a professional staff. Whatever your training methods are for the employees, don't stop. So long as that's true, you'll have a customer for life. Be back soon!"
Positive	"I took my five year son here since last weekend.  It is a fun place for children 12 and under.  Worth checking out.  I used a Groupon that cost $15.00 for two tickets.  Adults really do not need a ticket considering most of the entertainment is geared towards children.

Jambo has miniature golf, laser tag, mechanical animal rides, a train and a couple of other rides.  In addition, they have arcade style games requiring tokens as payment.

My son had fun.  I would recommend Jambo for children.  I had noticed attention paid to security (e.g. cameras and staff), a friendly and helpful staff and a cool temperature controlled environment which is great for summer time in Phoenix.

I have to say I was surprised at the taste and quality of food.  It was good.  The fries were first rate and the hamburger was tasty!  Bravo.  I was expected Chuck E Cheese style food, not here.

My suggestion for a five star would be to decrease the size of the miniature golf area and add a couple more rides or features (e.g. wide screen or carnival type games).  

I have to say that I did read some other reviews and let me say the following: do not worry about stray excrement in the park, it is probably not out there.  Even if you are unlucky enough to find it, do not blame the proprietor, it can happen anywhere!  Secondly, yes this park is for kids under 12.  Yes it is advertised as such both inside and outside.  If you are too old, don't go.  That simple.

My son and I had a great time and I would highly recommend it to others."
Positive	"Hello spa day!!! I had to tame these eyebrows at Dolce Salon & Spa today! Luckily I read the reviews on Yelp, and also found out that they were running specials if you were a member on their fan page on Facebook! I got 40% off my eyebrow waxing. My technician Yvette was really experienced and understood my needs. The salon was really clean and looked like a multi-leveled castle!

I will definitely come back in the future for a massage here~!!! Thanks!!"
Positive	Such nice people -- all whom I met.  Carrie especially.  Good selection of healthy plants, OK parking, convenient to SR51.   A nice experience -- especially after the cold shoulder that Willfill manages to show time and again.
Positive	"I'm giving this place four solid stars. My friend and I ate here during happy hour after seeing a movie at Red Rock. We stuck with the HH menu - some Garlic Knots, Chicken Tenders, and of course, their draught beer. The knots were delicious and definitely a HH crowd pleaser. The chicken was pretty good; they were tender fingers, but even though we ordered them hot, I could almost detect no spiciness.

To wash down the food, I had a Blonde Ale, while my friend started with their Hardway IPA and then switched to the Blonde Ale. I found the Blonde Ale to be quite tasty. At $2.50 for 22oz, it's definitely a steal. I tried a sample of the IPA and it tasted like a solid IPA! I wasn't in the mood for something that hoppy, but I can see myself ordering it next time. I also had a sample of their blueberry and vanilla wheat. I'm glad I did the sample first because it wasn't something of which I'd want a whole glass. It reminded me of another beer I've tried in the past that tastes like Fruity Pebbles!

What I truly appreciated about our visit today was the service that John provided us. It was just the little things he did to make sure we were happy. After all, it was happy hour. For example, when my friend ordered the IPA, he warned that it might be getting towards the bottom of the barrel, so he brought out a sample first. He also suggested that I get a sample of the blueberry and vanilla wheat first because other people have found it to be too strong in its fruitiness. I was actually going to ask for a sample, but he suggested it ahead of me. (And I'm really glad because I ended up not ordering it). He was also mindful of the fact that we were there for happy hour. He offered and came through by warning us when happy hour was almost over.

I can't speak for their entire menu, but this place is certainly on my list of good happy hours. Oh wait, I need to update my list! It's a little out of my way, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area, especially since I've now decided to see all my films at Red Rock."
Positive	My wife and I moved back to Cleveland area in 2009. Dr. Bennett was referred to us by a friend and we couldn't be happier. Now we have 2 small children who love going to the dentist because of the awesome people here!  It feels more like seeing old friends then it does going to a dentist office. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great dentist in Cleveland's west side
Positive	"Great coffee, great snacks, very spacious with lots of outlets and natural lighting. What's not to like?

Located a bit further from the hustle of downtown Toronto but still located minutes away from the subway station is this gem of a coffeeshop. I got the Magic coffee which is a mini cappuccino which was delicious. There's also fantastic scones and popsicles here! But I really have to give it to the decor of the place. Lots of tables and spaces to work. Comfortable couches. Natural lighting best for reading books. This is a great spot to catch up with friends or study!"
Positive	"It is all about the Wine and Beer bar! We stopped by today and Brian and Vincent were awesome. We had a steak and shrimp grilled and served at the bar from the meat department! What a great concept to learn about the vino, beer and enjoy the food from the meat counter! I will be back.
Ps the steak was 9.95. If we purchased in a restaurant it would cost 45-60.
Check it out! Bam!!!!!"
Positive	We have dined at this Firefly location a number of times and I finally decided to submit a review. On this visit there were 3 of us and we shared a number of hot and cold items. There are several choices of seating. Bar area, dining room and outdoor patio.  The patio has a fireplace and gas heaters. Service was friendly and the food service was timely. The dishes were delivered at different intervals as to the various cooking times. We shared the following: Tuna Tartare, Padron Peppers, Firefly Fries, Chorizo Clams, Albondigas (Meatballs) Steak and Mushroom Skewers and Babyback Ribs. All of the dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked. The Babyback Ribs were served in a Mango BBQ Sauce as noted on the menu. However, the sauce had a tangy bite. We were told the sauce also contained Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. You may want to verify this before ordering. Since I enjoy heat it was fine for my taste. The food goes great with a pitcher of White Sangria. Cheers!
Positive	"DELICIOUS!

Although the prices are always outrageous, we always make a point to come here every time we're in town. The variety is always great, and there's always just that one ingredient that's out of the ordinary that you never would have tried in a different setting. I love that they offer bonne maman jams for the breads for breakfast, and bonne maman honey if you request tea. It's the details that count. 

The waiters and waitresses are always nice, and make an effort to keep your table as clear of plates as possible. They also try to refill your drinks even if it's still almost full! However, their servers (especially those that carve meat) aren't so nice.They always have a grumpy face going on. IDK why, but it makes me want to avoid those areas. 

Their creme brulee is yummy, and their tea presentation is just so cute. The variety of desserts isn't huge, but what's there is quality. Bellagio... keeping up their good name by keeping their buffet great."
Positive	This place is awesome! Great food, great service, great decor. I can't say enough good things about it. We've been several times. Some of my favorites are the flight of dips, chicken and waffles and the philly tacos. Hang out around the fire for a drink once you're done eating. Best restaurant in Waxhaw.
Positive	This is my favorite Toronto tourist restaurant and it has been since the early 90's! Little has changed since then because perfection needs no improvement. Great place for families; everyone can choose what they'd like to eat and sit for as long as you'd like. Ample high chairs are provided. There's even a small playground and kids area! The desserts are my favorite part of this place, but everything I've ever had was yummy.
Positive	"Anji and Ryan are amazing artists and people. They are dedicated to providing quality work, cleanliness, affordability, friendliness, fun, and so on.
Their excitement to the commitment of life-long art makes every tattoo experience the best it can be.
Custom work, and they don't allow clients to settle on a design until it is perfect - to the clients wishes as well as their abilities. 
They have never become complacent with their talent or business; they are always researching and utilizing different techniques to continue to provide excellent tattoos and quality. They know ""how the skin works/handles things,"" and they act accordingly.
Love them!"
Positive	"This rating is probably helped by the fact that both the wife and I redeemed MyVegas points for comped caviar and vodka (she had champagne) dishes.  We really were just feet away from people walking through the lobby, yet it still seemed posh.  The pianist was also just a few feet from us, and I felt so classy joining in on the golf clap after he would finish a piece.

Process was easy peasy.  Just checked in at the MLife desk and then walked back to Petrossian.  We explained to the host and server what we'd done and they just asked to make sure we had our MLife cards on us (so they could run a check at the end of your meal and apply the proper comps).

You get three 1.5 oz pours of different vodkas paired with different caviars.  Look at other reviewers' pictures and you'll see the crumbled egg whites and yolks plus onions served with the caviar along with some soft bready things.  (There is also gratis thin toast if you prefer.)  This normally retails for $105/pp.  The wife couldn't resist getting the foie gras ($40).

If you use a comp, please make sure to still tip on the full value!  We did, so whoever's up next, you'll get some good service.  =]  (and no, the server did not remind us to do so; she was fabulous despite running the risk we'd forget)"
Positive	This place is awesome!!!!!! I love coming here, the customer service is so welcoming. Ive been here 3/4 times and they always have Netflix playing movies while you wait. Very authentic mexican snacks!
Positive	Just the openers,  amazing. French onion soup and peppered calamari and rock shrimp were delicious. We're waiting on our steaks, lobster mac, & garlic mashed potatoes,  to be followed by some scrumptious dessert.  My sister in law loves this place and I think she's got great taste.  My medium in bone filet was great until i got more middle region.   Too under done for my taste,  but i was really full by then. My husband ate it up like a hungry shark.  He loved it all.
Positive	"Dr Chin worked on me today and it was the best dentist appointment ever I didn't feel any pain. 
Had a crown placement and cavity fixed all in 1 hour on a Sunday. You can't beat that."
Positive	I came here for hair extensions. I spoke with Melissa about what I wanted and a few days later had my appointment with her. I was SO happy with the results. She did an amazing job!!! She knew exactly what she was doing. I am beyond satisfied and will be coming back regularly from here on out for my hair. And maybe I will try other amenities that they have! Everyone was really nice and welcoming.
Positive	"another great experience! food is still fantastic and I got to try cold soba tonight. My server was friendly and on top of things. Best chirashi bowl I've had in town. 
I finally had the green tea cheesecake and it was just the right portion, not too sweet and delicious. They also get brownie points for remembering my name."
Positive	The Kilauea burger is only half the reason I drive 25 from my house to come here. The other half is the bartenders Amanda Sue. In addition to the great food and ice cold beer, her excellent service and always great attitude are what really keep me coming back.
Positive	Bob, thanks so much for your support of Gregory's galactosemia fund raiser. Thanks to you and all of the generous donors in the Arcadia area, we raised $3,500 toward the fight of this metabolic disorder. You not only have a great place for fantastic eats but you have a wonderful heart. Thanks again, Greg.
Positive	The screen on my iPhone 6 was shattered. I brought it in and they repaired it with a new screen within no time at the best pricing in town! It looks great like new. I was very happy!!! I will refer everyone to them. Thank you!
Positive	"Consistently great food, and great service.  I love their local promotions like the ""1-2-3 that's enough for me"" where you received a free 3 piece chicken strip. Great management.  Love the calendar coupons too.  Would recommend buying one each year.  Great savings for sure.  I love the new grilled chicken salad.  It's a little pricey, but tastes great and is fresh."
Positive	This place is so cute , food are fresh and good , service are excellent , they have infused water , the menu is perfect cover a little bit of everything
Positive	Before visitors can enter museum, everyone with backpacks & shopping bags must store his & her belongings @ complimentary storage counter. On September 27, 2016, we spent $40.00 Canadian dollars for 2 (two) visitors. There are guided tours included with admission to exhibition. Museums, restrooms & gift shop are clean. Restrooms are available @ every building; NOT accessible AFTER museum closed for the day. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to visit all exhibitions. We recommend tourists to visit museum when it opens @ 11am in order to have enough time to visit all exhibitions. This way, you can get the most bang for your buck. There should be signs/museum volunteers/staff members to direct tourists from Michael & Renata hornstein pavilion to Liliane & David m Stewart pavilion to jean Noel desmarais pavilion to Claire & Marc bourgie pavilion.  Otherwise, tourists become confused whether museum tour ended & might prematurely departed museum which can be disappointing.
Positive	"Looking for a healthy alternative to all those super fatty fast foods UNLV is surrounded by? Gave up meat, can't eat meat, or don't eat meat? You have two choices: you could either cook your own grub at home or you could visit Bowl Of Heaven. Located next to Cafe Rio across from the Student Union, it is the newest acai bowl shop! 

AMBIANCE: 4 - Small, clean, new. Ah, the freshness of new businesses! It makes you thankful that Vegas always opens several new places all the time. BOH doesn't seat many, but is is bright and inviting, simple and super organized. For college students, it's really the place to be! To be...you know, healthy!!  

SERVICE: 5 - The staff are all friendly and super helpful. They're sweet and all have their biggest smiles on. The managers/owner are always checking to see if everything is tasting good & if you're enjoying it! Not to mention, they crank out bowls super fast--like they were born to make them! 

FOOD: 4 - BOH sells acai bowls, smoothies, and juices on their menu. Also, how  you order will depend on what you like and your tastes are. I usually like traditional flavors, so you know what my favorite bowl is: The North Shore Original! The staff recommended the Red Zinger bowl for my next visit, and honestly, I can't wait to try it! 

I do admit that I wish it was open at 7:30 so I could grab some before my morning class. I'm definitely guilty of being one of those students that munch during biology lecture! 

I don't claim to know a ton about acai bowls. Honestly, I haven't consumed many....yet. But I do know taste, and Bowl of Heaven is pretty yummy! Sometimes, you just need a new way to get healthy, and BOH is definitely the new best way to eat healthy at UNLV!"
Positive	"Came here to meet some new friends we got takoyaki, wings and cheese corn. The chicken was really good, the takoyaki was average. My friends enjoyed the cheese corn though. Overall great place to hang out, very chill and relaxing atmosphere. They had kpop on but it didnt match with the tv. Defintely a place ti take a date

Price: $$
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Interior: 5/5"
Positive	"Yes, the Resturant is small but they just opened a new bar area that offers much more seating and they have some great speciality cocktails on the menu. The bar manager is great, very friendly and a great mixologist!  
After some wonderfully prepared and great ""bar-food"" in Maximus a few days ago, we went back today for brunch 
The cocktails we had the other night were great, only to find the best Bloody Mary in town this morning. 
As recommended by our wonderful server, I had the steak scones whereas others in my party had the eggs Benedict and the Spanish Skillet, all of which were nothing short of magnificent!
We love this little place and will surely continue to return over and over again!"
Positive	Best yoga studio I've ever been to.  I've never left a class without being drenched and feeling amazing.  They have fantastic music (in my opinion) as well - most classes are upbeat - the fusion class in particular is my favorite -  half yoga, half plyometrics/cardio and weights.  They also have basic and restorative classes if you're not in the mood for a hard workout and your body just needs some tlc.  No need to feel intimated by the  yoga experience here either!  Everyone is so friendly and very welcome to new yogis.
Positive	My wife and son just had our super-efficient and fun photo shoot with Stuart near Abbott Kinney.  We had purchased a Groupon and were impressed by his portfolio and he did not disappoint.  We took several shots around the eclectic Venice neighborhood, and I am excited to see how they turned out.  It was an overall pleasant experience, without any fuss.  I would recommend getting a photo shoot done by stuart, especially if our pics turn out half as good as those on his portfolio!
Positive	"HECK YEAH!!!!!
I came here a couple weeks ago and because of West Side Market, I'm now looking for a place to live in Ohio City just so I can come here every Saturday!!!

If I had to rate West Side Market purely on the food itself, I would probably give it a 3.5 stores. None of the ready-to-eat foods were that good or memorable. But the reason West side market deserves 4.5 stars is because of its history and for the atmosphere and just the uniqueness of it all. 

I love the crowd that west side market attracts, I love the variety of produce, herbs, meats, and food it has, and I also love the vibe and atmosphere of this place. I'm never an early morning person so when I finally got to wake up early enough to get to West Side Market, I was amazed! There were so many buildings to go to and so many booths to look around. 

Here's all the stores I went to and my short reviews on them: 
PopCorn Store: pretty amazing since it has just about any flavors of popcorn you can think of. 

Hot Smoothie: not very good smoothies and wayyyy overpriced. The store was across the popcorn store. 

Tamale: loved that they were able to heat it up for me right there. It wasn't the best tamale ever but totally worth it for the price!

Crepes: yum! this crepe store is so efficient and it has so many different types of crepe. The one complaint was that the crepe itself wasn't crunchy enough and not the best crepe i've ever had. 

Cannoli Desserts: There were like 6 booths with cannoli but we chose a random store and got 3 flavors of cannoli. First, it was overpriced and second the flavors wern't that great so blehhh. 

Also the Steve's Gyros store had a huge line. Honestly, i've had steve's gyros before and don't think it's the best store. But they do give you quite a bit of meat that it's pretty awesome.

My boyfriend and I also bought a pack of spinach gnocchi. We recently cooked it and mehh i dont know.. flavors weren't there. I've been meaning to go back and buy some pasta though since I heard that's great there!

One complaint... I wish there was a place in west side market where I can sit down and drink coffee and enjoy the foods. I wish they could build a second floor where I can just look down at the market and enjoy people watching too."
Positive	"I ate here with my bf before leaving Vegas, and it's one of the best Korean restaurant I've been to. 

Just wish the place is a little bigger but other than that the price is awesome, very affordable!"
Positive	I called in take out and the young lady was very nice on the phone. Then I came inside to pick up my order and the entire staff greeted me with hello and some cooks while cooking acknowledged me with just a nod. It was very nice! The young lady hooked me up with some free egg rolls too! When we got home we couldn't believe the portions they gave. They give a lot! Idk what some people are talking about the bland taste of the food. I thought it was good. Was it great, no, I tasted far way better back in the Bay Area. If you expect exceptional then you'll have to take yourself to a high end Chinese restaurant. This is just off of Craig Rd, I wouldn't expect high end. China Passion's food is pretty good and at least it isn't fast food processed food.
Positive	"I grew up in Glendale,Ca which is predominately   Armenian/Middle Eastern so Middle Eastern food is my absolute favorite. I've searched and searched for great quality (as authentic as can be) Middle Eastern food since I moved to Vegas a little over a year ago and haven't found anything good; until TODAY!!!!!


My husband told me about Shawarma Plus and I was skeptical until I tried the food. I had a Shawarma sandwhich and omg it was so delicious. 

I tried the garlic sauce (which is always a must) and it was fresh and you can tell that it's homemade. 

I don't always eat Baklava because it's usually too sweet for my liking, the Baklava here gets 5 stars also. 

To top it all off, the owner and everyone else are super nice and welcoming.

I will frequent Shawarma Plus often, that's for darn sure. 

Thank you."
Positive	Wonderful place to stay! We had so much fun and the staff was great! My son had a fantastic time with the friends he made at the pool. We really enjoyed the fun activities and trivia they had every couple of hours to keep the kids occupied...it was fun for us adults too! Obsessed with their white tea and aloe lotion! It is AMAZING and very moisturizing after our time spent at the pool! Can't wait for our next visit!
Positive	Do yourself a favor and don't even think about calling any other heating and air conditioning company in northern Ohio:  Bay Furnace & Air Conditioning is by far the most professional, experienced and honest heating company around. A week before Thanksgiving and two days before the first snow fall here in Bay Village, Ohio, the smoke and carbon monoxide detector alarm inexplicably went off in my 91 year-old mother's home. The first heating company I paid to diagnose the problem concluded that my mother needed a whole new furnace and chimney liner installed immediately after a cursory inspection of the heat exchange unit and shut the furnace off and turned off the gas.  I called Marty at Bay Furnace for a second opinion and combustion test and I am so very glad I did! The Smoke/CO detectors needed replacement, NOT the furnace! Thank you, thank you, Marty, for being honest and saving my elderly mother and me several thousand of dollars replacing a furnace that did not to be need replaced,  and Sandy for sending Marty out when your phones were ringing off the hook right before the holidays! Bay Furnace is the best!
Positive	Love going to this place for the early bird breakfast special - your typical breakfast but comes with homemade jam that changes everyday. Cute decor and good place to start your day. Not a fan of butter tarts, but I haven't heard a bad review yet!
Positive	"These folks have, without a doubt, the largest collection of collectors editions and other rare gaming paraphernalia, that I have seen in Toronto.

They're professional, have a great online web presence, and lots of stock.

They are a true local gaming store, like Gamerama at Yonge & Eglinton. These folks are a little more ""retail friendly"" than gamerama is, which to most is probably a good thing for most. If you're looking for a place to go and buy games, go here. I get all my pre-orders from these guys. :)

They don't strike me as big of ""gaming enthusiasts"" as gamerama is, however - If you're a hardcore gamer looking to have a real experience shopping with your peer group, gamerama is the place to go.

But for everyone else? Video Games Plus (VGP) should be your first choice. You won't be disappointed."
Positive	All kinds of everything you need for gifts!!!  The funniest selection of cards (I only buy my holiday cards here - the family knows they will get a laugh when mine comes in the mail!)  Very unique and nostalgic items too.  You will spend a solid hour just wandering around and laughing at the funny and silly items tucked innocently amoung the every-day items.  Hmmm I think I need a Bible which is really just a hiding spot for my flask - perfect for church!  Hmmm I think I could really use an alligator cheese grator...or a pickle bandaid.....maybe a one-sy for my sister's new baby that says 'boob man'.  Hilarious!!!  :-D
Positive	"Happy to have found this gem! The past few months have had bad tacos in Cabo (don't ask) and bad burritos in Kentucky (late night shame). Desperate to reset my Mexican palate and to atone for the sins of bad Mexican food, I needed some good solid tacos. 

This place is big and clean, definitely no hole in the wall Taqueria! Legua and Carnitas it is, to be washed down with Horchata. The salsa bar is nice -  lots of fixings and the salsa are all so good.

Cravings satisfied!!! Looking forward to coming back next time to try their Al Pastor and Asada! Big thumbs up for the delicious food and friendly staff!"
Positive	"UPDATE:  I was contacted by the owner, Mike, to redo my vehicle. These guys really care and stand behind their work. Definitely recommend. 


Original: Cool people but the lady over exaggerated on how dark the tint is, the quality is amazing ! The time it got done maybe 30 minutes way less than the estimate time. Had an appointment got there early took me in right away! The best part is the waiting room where they have complimentary drinks and a tv to lounge with others if you are as outgoing as I am. Everything is professionally done and definitely would go back.

Now the remorse. I still am very upset on how much light and heat still comes into my car, I wanted 50 and she implied 40 is dark enough and most clients get that for the windshield but had ZERO photos of customer cars. So AS A BUYER I listened to her, and I am very dissatisfied with the amount or darkness the film has. DONT GET ME WRONG IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND CATCHES EVERYONES EYES but NOT WHAT I WANTED. 

Would I go back? Yes but not gunna listen to her again"
Positive	I have lived around the corner from this diner for almost 2 years now and go there maybe 2 or 3 times a month. It has character and the wait staff is pleasant. The food is typical diner style...which is what i want when i go here. We have never had a bad experience except for getting crappy corn bread just one time.
Positive	"My favorite Apple store in the city! I will warn you however that this is the busiest store in our area. It is always packed no matter what day of the week you visit. 

The staff is always friendly and upbeat. You should schedule an appointment ahead of time, that will assure you prompt service. Although, depending on the difficulty level the wait can be at least 30 minutes. 

It's my go to Apple location, it's centrally located in the bustling heart of Shadyside and it's Apple what more can I say but GREAT!"
Positive	Delightful spot for weekend breakfast! We had the France and Sophie galettes and they were fabulous- the staff were very sweet and helpful and let us try some of their homemade jams (the peach mint and the persimmon were amazing). If you're looking for authentic French crepes and galettes this is your place! We will be back again!
Positive	This is my favourite place to get a little snack on my way home. It has a very modern but cute interior, and has a great atmosphere. The pastries - especially the cookies - that are available are always delicious, and they offer a variety of things! We ordered a birthday cake here about half a year ago and it was just delicious! The staff is also super super nice and welcoming!
Positive	"My favourite book store! I love everything about it! 
Wide selection of books! I find he latest books here! It's all organized and easy to find! They also have a huge area for books on sale marked-down to $10. or less and these aren't old, old books?
I love the lighting. Soft, not to clear and sharp. 
I love how they arrange books in between some other small finds. It give a breathing space. Not too heady feel. 
I love that they have a little of everything! Bags, scarves, teas, water bottles and many other small finds. They also have chocolates, popcorns and candies too! 
The space lay-put isn't structured like a stiff books store. 
They also have an area for infants, toddlers and kids with clothes, toys and many other stuff.
I like the gadget corner too! 
I also like it that they have Starbucks too! 
Prices are reasonable. 
Most staff are quite knowledgable of their products. Not too much with the gadget area tho. 
Parking is good o side the plaza."
Positive	I grew up in an Italian household and this place tastes like how mom used to cook. This is my favorite restaurant in old town. Minimal if any wait times, friendly staff and reasonably priced food. This is my top pick for sure.
Positive	"I would give this place a 5, except the place has a difficult parking lot to park in and the starbucks is very small.  The customer service is great, when I asked them a lot of questions about their food items, the lady was super sweet and did not make me feel bad.  I went to buy a breakfast egg mcmuffin and it was extremely hot and fresh.  It was more on the salty side and kind of expensive, but it was bigger and has better ingredients than the one at Mcdonalds.  As for drinks, who can really complain about starbucks?  They will pretty much make anything that ask.  I like getting these drinks the best:

Green Tea Frappacino 
Chocolate Chips Frappacino
Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher
Caramel Machiatto Iced or Hot
White Chocolate Mocha Latte
Chai Latte"
Positive	"Now this was the visit I was wanting from my previous visit.  Flavors were delicate, yummy and textures were there!  For the first time, I thought that the bomb items would naturally come from the ""special"" menu, but this time, we went with the gut feeling and ordered more instinctively from the main menu.  This time is was truly good.

Bonus appetizer:
*Deep fried yamaimo (Mountain Potato) - It was like eating delicate fries.  The potato had tempura batter and very lightly salted.  Crispy and delicious!

*Albacore w/Drew Special and Tuna Carpaccio- I'm going to group this dish with the Tuna Carpaccio in terms of flavor.  Both had tangy sauce that complimented the tuna.                                
*Agedashi Tofu - Kyara makes a slighty darker and saltier sauce, but I appreciated the delicately fried tofu cubes.
*Eggplant Steak - This was on the saltier side, but I enjoyed it overall
*Butabara - Bacon slices on a stick!!!!  Being the piggies that we are, we ordered one order each of the salt and soy sauce/terikyaki-ish versions.  I'm a lover of most things greasy and bacon. This was a winner and the soy sauce version was the overall winner of the two.
*Kaisen Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with seafood) - This was probably our favorite of the evening.  The steamed egg custard was perfectly salty infused with the essences of the seafood within it.  Slurped it all up.
*Chicken Garlic Ponzu - This is basically a super tender pice of chicken cutlet with my fav flavors of garlic and ponzu.
*Tori Meshi - soboro (seasoned ground chicken) with rice, hearty rice and seasoned chicken.  Good!

Conclusion:  I am warming up to Kyara.  It's definitely not Raku caliber Japanese tapas, but it will do if you forget to make a reservation for Raku."
Positive	This is the best ramen place I've been to in Vegas! Even though it was pretty full when I came in, I got my food very quickly and the customer service was excellent. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was super rich and delicious! Can't wait to come back! :)
Positive	Today was my first ever visit to Cardamone's and as a hair salon snob I'm definitely impressed! Not only do I love the cut Lauren gave me but she was FAST! And not in a cutting corners, didn't go back for that one last piece to trim kind of way. I mean she did an awesome job and didn't make me feel like I was stuck behind a chair for my whole day which I BEYOND appreciate! I will absolutely be going back and highly recommend Cardamone's, and Lauren specifically, to anyone!
Positive	The vibe was great. The cocktails were beautiful and tasty and the food was magnificent. Definitely get the fritters and the romaine salad. I would go back for sure because everything on the menu sounds delicious. Go with a group so you can taste a bunch of different dishes!
Positive	I had a pleasant visit a few weeks ago and i thought I'd share my experience. When i got there i was greeted by a gentleman asking what brought me in. His name was Jeremy and he was very sweet and respectful, which is a pleasant surprise because any other dealerships I go to I feel swarmed by salesman and it makes me feel very rushed. He took the time to learn and understand my requests that my new vehicle would have and was very patient with my husband and I. Although we did not go through with trading in our vehicle, as we will be returning towards the holidays to seal the deal and possibly get our granddaughter a vehicle for her birthday, My husband and I strongly recommend Jeremy for anyone looking for a, respectfuleasy going, salesman! Ask for Jeremy!
Positive	I continue to have a great experience working as an agent of the team of brokers and associates to learn about commercial and residential real estate.  I have been with the team for two years now and have grown my business significantly due to the support and mentorship of the broker/owner, Akil Hameed and other team members I interact with on a daily basis.  Their commission structure is above most other brokerages in the Cleveland market.  I look forward to continuing to grow my commercial and residential real estate investments and brokerage with FASS Real Estate Services.
Positive	"Alfredo came to my house within a few hours of my first call of for a quote. Price was reasonable. I asked for exterior, interior and carpets washed. He took his time and from the results, he knows what he is doing! Quality work! I'll be having him come back for the upholstery next week! 

Recommending to everyone I know :)"
Positive	AMAZING chocolate chip cookies and coconut macaroons.  I put them in a close race with the Market at the Flying Fig for Best Chocolate Chip cookie I've ever eaten.  Skip Blackbird's coffee--it's terrible.
Positive	Amazing first impression as soon as I walked in. Was greeted and helped right off the bat. Let's start with the juice selection, By far probably the BIGGEST selection of E-juice I've seen thus far in Las Vegas. The customer service was amazing also very knowledgeable and helpful. Oh, and let's not forget about the deals! My new favorite spot to get my vape on. Big thanks to SJ for helping me out and getting the juice I wanted. Highly recommend this place for your Vaping needs.
Positive	So I went to CheezHeadz tonight and said I heard you guys have the best cheesesteak hoagie in phoenix...I'm from Pennsylvania and the hoagie was absolutely amazing! Definitely go check out CheezHeadz.
Positive	"I thought the food was very good, the service was not bad but not outstanding either. We waited a while longer than we should after we got seated before anyone approached us and then waited a bit longer after we ordered our first round of drink but after that things were fine and the waiter was on point from there on.  

I ordered the shreded pork enchilads and they were fantastic. They were not smothered in cheese or sauce like some places, just enough sauce and cheese so as not to overpower all the other flavors going on. We ordered guacamole and some queso fundido for appetizers. The guac was very good, a nice amount of spice and pomegranate seeds made for a different and unique taste. The queso fundido was ok, I have had much better. 

All in all it was a good experience and I would definately return or recommend to a friend."
Positive	Due to the recent Hurricane rains in AZ, our kitchen ceiling began to leak. We felt it was probably from the small overhanging roof above, but we needed someone to come out and assess the situation. When Jim arrived, I was immediately impressed by his friendly demeanor and professionalism. He did a thorough investigation into the potential issues and recommended that we go with a handyman, as he believed our roof was in overall good condition and the problem could be dealt with rather inexpensively. He easily could've upsold us and taken the job as he had already come all the way out, but he didn't. If we ever do need roof repair, we will absolutely go with Jim!
Positive	Amazing food and staff! I have celiac and came her for the past 2 years for New Years dinner. They are so great with gluten allergies! Even have a gluten free garlic knot and then for all meals the manager brings out the plate with an allergy sticker so you know 100% that it is gluten free. I highly recommend this place for a gluten free fancy steak dinner! Wow.
Positive	"I've been going to Com Pho Asia for years now. I used to work in the plaza and I'm pretty sure they know me by name there now. My favourite dish is the rice and chicken with a fried egg. 

The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing."
Positive	"I've been visiting this store for awhile for minor jewelry repairs,  watch batteries,  cleanings.  Love that they can do the work immediately in most cases.  Jeweller is on site.  If I ever left anything it was a very short turnaround.

Recently I had a diamond reset into a custom setting. Amy totally understood what I wad looking for and the end piece is stunning, one of a kind. 

Very reasonable pricing as well on all their services. 

Shops like  this are few and far between.  Family owned and operated,  this  that  business really take pride in their craft as well as service."
Positive	This is now my favorite thai place. ive been going here three times and never fails me. The price for their food is very reasonable. Dont go without trying their sticky rice for dessert, its very yummy!! I would recommend this place to all my friends and family
Positive	"4.5/5 

Now this was the only place for desserts my boyfriend and I went to during our trip to Toronto and it was amazing. It was this hipster place connected to a restaurant but they had their own door around the side. We ordered the Nutella one. And it was amazing. They add this little cone holder at the bottom which helps with the droplets because they stack it pretty tall. It was topped with Nutella, pistachios, and these crumbley things and it was amazing!! Totally recommend when in the area."
Positive	"One of my girlfriends picked Kokopelli Winery in downtown Chandler for our monthy get together.  When I walked in on a Wednesday night, there was a very small crowd, so I was a little concerned.  I've always been told that the AZ wines are just ok, but I decided to give them a try.  Our waitress brought me a sample of their reserve Chianti.  I'm not usually a fan, but this one has a pretty smooth finish.  

I was looking over the menu, and having a hard time deciding. A friend of mine had HIGHLY recommended the garlic chicken. When I saw the menu said 40 cloves of garlic, I has some serious 2nd thoughts.  I decided to give it a try.  WOOOO was it ever good.  The chicken was litterally fall off the bone and super juicy!

I finished things off with their EXCELLENT bread pudding.  Wow.  Was it ever good.  Their brandy sauce totally makes it.  I'd actually love to go back and have this again."
Positive	Was in town to visit a relative and decided to come here for our departing meal. Breakfast was fantastic. Food was fresh and tasty. Service was friendly. Nothing fancy but that is not what you would come here for anyway. We had a great experience.
Positive	"Yes this Starbuck is busy, and yes this Starbucks can be slow.

But it is the first Starbucks I have gone to that the barista made a great suggestion. I love my Caramel Macchiato's BUT I am tired of my Caramel Macchiato's. And the Barista suggested half Vanilla and half Hazelnut. 

I love my new drink and I love that she thought to suggest something new.

That is something I just don't get about Starbucks, they rarely add new drinks to their menu, and I am sure most Starbucks fans are ready for something new! I have my new drink...now I just need to figure out how to order it everywhere...hmmmm"
Positive	There are two designs for MD stores that I've seen - this one is like the Solon location and doesn't have the expanded cafe/prepared food section like the one in Green. They do have a great eating section both indoors and outdoors, and a private room to rent with an attached patio upstairs. MD stores are not the least expensive option for groceries, but they always seem to have great quality across their store.
Positive	"The single by pass burger was delicious and the right size. Along with the 1/2 pound hot dog. It was so heavy that you can't eat it with your hands, you have to cut the hot dog up into portions to eat it. 

Note: They don't sell diet coke here..."
Positive	"For years, it has been my family's favorite steakhouse (three locations, we have been on Sainte Catherine, De La Montagne and Decarie). 

The restaurant is huge. It has always a cozy feeling. The service always has been good. Never had any issues with any of the staff.

Best comfort food. My sisters, one had her all time favorite the chicken tenders with garlic mashed potatoes; and she always asks for the pepper sauce without charge; second sister had Baton Rouge burger, which she devoured it. I had steak and fries which I asked for medium rare. You know what, it was cooked perfectly! Then, three of us, ordered peanut butter brownie cake to share. It was a huge portion; every layer of this cake super delicious. 

The price is a bit of high though... all steakhouses are... but the food is comfortingly delicious."
Positive	I was in the area for a quick bite and came across this gem. I didn't even realize they had one of these in AZ because I've been to the one in Southern CA. I had a hot pastrami and Swiss! The bread was perfect as was the sandwich. I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.
Positive	This is my favorite spot in Vegas! Brian is a fantastic bartender with beautiful eyes and a friendly smile! I come here every trip to Vegas as my last night drinking spot. They have buy one get one cocktails and they are all delicious and they get the job done. Awesome tunes flow from the speakers from Michael Jackson to Bob Marley! Always a fun time...I highly recommend this wonderful spot right in the front of Bally's! Check out out!
Positive	"Highly impressed! Would definitely recommend, would definitely return! 

Came here for a McGill Alumni Wine Tasting and Pairing event with my dad on a warm and rainy Wednesday evening. 

The Bistro's two Sommeliers were spectacular and endearing. Both down to earth, friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about every one of the 5 Austrian wines they presented and paired thoughtfully with perfectly conceived bouchées. 

This event was geared at the seasoned wine connoisseurs and the amateurs, such as myself, alike. I was enthralled in a panoply of information and sensations and I would gladly repeat the occasion a million times over.

In particular the duck confit croquettes were to die for, my favorite taste of the night! Also of particular note, would be the dessert wine, which was out of this world; and we were among the last people to get to savour it here in Québec, as we had the last 3 bottles only available via import. 

The service was impeccable and unwaivering. The price was definitely on the higher scales but worth every penny. I can't wait to go back for a tasty treat and a very good well sought glass of wine!"
Positive	A nice little cafe inside the Paris Hotel. There is a variety of pastries, muffins and desserts. I had the banana nut muffin to go. The muffin was tasty and not too sweet. Moist and the muffin top was crispy. A great place to grab a snack on the go.
Positive	It's the closest thing to Chick-Fil-A until the real thing arrives. Their fries are great, and the chicken fingers are moist. I don't feel as bad eating here than, say, Raising Cane's, and I prefer the sauces at PDQ. Try all of the dipping sauces until you find your favorites. I like the sweet sriracha and creamy garlic sauces.
Positive	"Great buffet only if you eat seafood.  The large crab claws and crab legs are the freshest and the sweetest.  The king jumbo shrimps are to die for. Eat five of those, and I guarantee your stomach will be full hehe. The clam chowder, really hidden from view because they have so much selection of pretty food, is actually really delicious and packed with huge chunks of clams. Sometimes they have tiny scallops on the shell. Those are little bites of crispy and creamy goodness.  I also always gravitate towards their selection of cheeses and thin slices of cured meats.  Very tasty and so not good for your arteries hehe. I really only focus eating on the seafood because no other buffet can compare or come close to offering that kind of seafood. I've been here at least 4 times.  And every single time had been enjoyable for me and my tummy. 

I suggest eating early for dinner (around 4pm) to avoid the crowd and wait time. And to go on mon-thurs, it's cheaper than Fri sat and sun."
Positive	"The company is owned by brothers Sam and Josh King.  These guys are redefining the art of residential window cleaning. I could not have been more pleased with the job these guys do.  They start with a competitive quote and follow it up with attention to detail in the window cleaning process that is over-the-top. 

They are also, very reliable.  They work with you to select a day and time that works best for you and confirm same with an email.  They then reconfirm the appointment with another email a day before.  They show up on time and they take a great amount of time to make sure the job is perfect.  I would highly recommend these guys.  Phone # is 480.331.1165.

I"
Positive	"Go here to buy musical stuff, whether it be for orchestral, rock and roll, Jazz, or Latin.

They have a great, diversified selection of stuff.

The drum department is great, they even get Constantinoples, and other high end cymbals in there.  They have a massive drum head selection, and decent amount of good drum kits in varying sizes.  

The place will factory order things that you need if they don't have them in stock and they will price lower than competitors.  All of this with a friendly educated staff, not clueless douche rockers like Guitar Center. 

It's a family business and has been in the valley for years... I remember my first music folder in band in 3rd grade being a Milano's music folder.  

I go here to rubberneck, cause Guitar Center is too softcore.

Go buy some shits here and jam out with your clam out."
Positive	To Isabel.. I was happy with your service on June 8th around 12pm..I guess others in my party were not...I love coming here.my daughter and I sneak here whenever we can.this time we were celebrating her graduation...and as always it was a great time.. Even if we had to stay at the other end of the table, to be away from the party we came with..ijs....really booshie....lol....thank you ..
Positive	We really enjoyed our visit here. The floor to ceiling sliding doors coupled with the beautiful weather was so relaxing. My husband and I shared the shrimp salad, hummus and Brie pizza and they were all delicious. Our kids loved the wood fired pizza. The server was attentive and very helpful. Also, they give a great military discount, which we really appreciate. Great little neighborhood restaurant and we look forward to returning.
Positive	What a great place. I needed a battery for my car today. They got me a genuine Ford Motor Company batter in 1 hour at a decent price. Chris is wonderful and amazing person to help me with my car today. I am so blessed to have had your assistance. Thank youall at AJ's auto parts.
Positive	We stopped last Wednesday and so glad we did!  Delicious Margaritas, great guac and chips with salsa to start.  The Tortilla soup really good and hearty.  Had the Tacos Al Pastor for dinner  - fantastic, they were seasoned just right with roasted pineapple and cilantro.  Good stuff.  We will be back.  Got free guac with the Yelp check in btw....
Positive	"Food makes me happy. Good food makes me giddy! Hash House a Go Go makes me happy giddy, jump on tables, bonkers!

The portions are ridonculously humongous! I suggest sharing, but be wary of the split plate charge ($2.95). Just have the other person order a side of bacon, which'll cost you the same thing anyway. I've never had anything but their breakfast items here: pancakes, scrambles, hash, chicken & waffles. I heard there's another side to the menu that consists of lunch items...sandwiches n'stuff, but really...why would you wanna do that?!? 

Hash House A Go Go...I think I love you more than bacon."
Positive	"I'm a big fan of eggslut from LA so it was obviously going to be my go-to breakfast while staying at the Cosmo. The line for eggslut here is ridiculous but it actually goes by pretty fast. It wraps to the end of the hallway but it probably took me about 35 minutes to get to the front and wait 10 minutes for my sandwich to get out. Hey, it's faster than room service and cheaper!!! I usually get the slut or Fairfax but I ventured out to the egg salad sando and it's a great ""lighter"" alternative to other options on the menu. It was creamy but fresh and the warm brioche bun is always consistently fluffy and addicting. The staff is super nice and they work efficiently for sure! Will always be back when in Vegas!"
Positive	I had Eco Electric come out and wire 3 rooms for overhead lights/fans.  Their price was a few hundred dollars cheaper than the other quote I received.  The work was done in 3 hours, just as they estimated and the workers were very courteous.  I would highly recommend them and I will not be calling anyone else the next time I need electrical work done,  Great Job!!!
Positive	"What a welcoming studio!!! Right from the start I felt like I was apart of the cycle crew even though it was my first time there -- my water bottle and a cute welcome card was waiting for me upon arrival ; the lady at the front checked me in with the ipad and introduced me to the owner Eve (who is a DOLL)! The studio is CLEAN, BRIGHT and TRENDY! Super modern. 

Loren was my cycle instructor and she was soooooo energetic ; she explained everything throughly and made sure everyone was comfortable.  The highlight of my ride was walking out sweaty and finding snacks and drinks on the bar to celebrate Cinco De Mayo!! What a great touch! 

I will FOR SURE return , I'm excited to cycle with other instructors."
Positive	"We used Brewer Caldwell to manage a property that we bought for a rental investment.

The people at B.C. are very smart and energetic.
Their prices are great... and their service is super.

I have to laugh at two of the reviews.  If the heat is out and the repair is delayed ? --  that is the OWNERS fault, not Brewer Caldwell's fault.   BC puts pressure on us owners to fix these things... for sure...believe me.  When we try to get an AC/Heat job done, it may take a couple of days since the AC/Heat repair guys are backed up with work.  Get a space heater and get over it.

The other person certainly viewed the property and chose to live there.  That is also not B.C.'s fault.    If it was filthy ?  They saw it was filthy before they moved in....come on....Wake up people."
Positive	I could drink these massive yummy alcoholic delights all day and night while in Vegas. Actually I did on my last trip. You can not beat the prices on this with the refills and locations all thru the strip. I had one in hand constantly last time I visited. My fav is the one in Imperial Palace. The bartenders were super friendly and fast. The 50/50 with an extra shot is perfection.
Positive	Vanessa Mitchell is awesome!!! Made me feel very welcomed from the start! I'm very picky with stylists but she asked all the right questions. I got a root touch up and trim. She made my hair color come out looking natural and layered my hair just enough to where it was still long but my split ends were gone. Love love love love my hair!!! Already scheduled my next appointment with her :)
Positive	"Overall, I had a very good experience. It was two days from my best friend's wedding, and I realized that I looked like a ghost in my bridesmaid's dress. I went online searching for a good spray tan salon (I did NOT want to take any chances with 48 hours until the wedding). After scouring Yelp and Google, I'd narrowed my search to three salons. Platinum was the third location that I called. The other two salons were unable to see me on such short notice.  MJ answered my phone call and told me that she would do her best to squeeze me in. Sure enough, she was able to get me an appointment set for 2 hours after my call. Awesome.  :)
The salon is located on the second floor of a building of office suites off of Mill and Broadway in Tempe. I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment and found the suite very quickly, since MJ had texted me directions. I was a bit confused when the door was locked and there was no sign anywhere indicating that it was even a business (from the outside, it looked like it could have even been large storage room)!  I am assuming that because the tanning artists also do mobile tanning, there is not always someone in the building... as for not having a sign? I'm not too sure about that one... 
My tanning artist arrived 5 minutes later.. Exactly on time for our appointment. She was extremely friendly and welcoming. I filled out paperwork while she set up the tanning area. I felt a little overwhelmed when she asked what color I wanted but did not have anything for me to reference... For example, I wish I could have seen a look-book or something in order to choose something that matched what I was looking for. I told her I wasn't quite sure but did not feel like I had to be too dark. It is November, after all :) She chose a color for me and it turned out to be perfect. 
I felt very comfortable throughout the tanning process since my artist was so friendly. The spray was freezing, but a little discomfort isn't so bad for a nice looking tan. When we finished, my artist asked if I was happy with my results or if I wanted to go darker. I was happy.  I paid with a credit card- it was $35 (GREAT price) with a $3 fee that MJ had warned me about.

PROS: 
Price
Flexible scheduling
Tan looks natural
Quick (in and out in 20 minutes)

CONS: 
Location weirded me out a little bit.
I would have liked more guidance choosing a color.
I'd had a spray tan in Boston once, where my artist used the tan to ""sculpt"" my body. She strategically put extra coats in areas that would typically get more sun and she sculpted my abs and arms really nicely! My tan at Platinum was more of a once over coat- without as much attention to these details. 

Overall - very solid experience and I would definitely go again (and would recommend it to a friend). If I could rate this a 4.5, I would, as my ""cons"" are pretty nuanced."
Positive	"This place has really good HH sushi. Also, I think after 3 it's Happy Hour for almost the rest of the night.

I've been here a couple times, and what I really like about it is that they have SEVERAL items on HH. Lots of appetizers and MANY rolls. Not just your run of the mill California & tuna rolls. Things like tootsie and Las Vegas rolls as well. Most of these are around five bucks each. Everything I've tried from here has tasted good.  

They also have good drink specials during HH. If I remember correctly sake bombers are under ten dollars for large ones, and they have cocktails for $7 each. 

It's a pretty nice place and service is good."
Positive	Came to Vegas to celebrate my husband's birthday and selected Black Sheep after doing our research on fabulous places to eat away from the Strip. This place is a gem tucked away in suburbia. The Imperial Egg Rolls were the best that we've ever tasted and the service was amazing.  Frankly everything was excellent.
Positive	"I found Tenea C. on Stylseat.com, and once I arrived, I learned she was at Tower Hair. Tenea was everything I needed for my first natural hair experience since moving to Charlotte! Her knowledge of product, protective styling, maintenance of different textures of hair, and all around friendliness made me confident that she is who I want to return to on a monthly basis. I totally recommend Tenea! 

Not only that, but 1) the other stylists and barbers at Tower were professional, funny and very welcoming, and 2) I didn't spend a lot of money and I was in an out within 2 hours!"
Positive	I had a long formal dress hemmed at Tina's last week. It was three layers and I needed it done in 48 hours... it was done in 24! They were very professional and did a great job.
Positive	The staff at this store rocks. They always have time for my questions and they are genuinely friendly. Their paint is next level too. Way better than the big box store stuff.
Positive	I'm so glad I found this company on line. They were so polite and professional from the first phone call, to the customer service once I went to their storefront location in Tempe. I was interested in learning more about a 3D printer for my husband, and they helped me with my questions on the phone, and the great service continued when I came into the storefront to purchase it for my husband. I did not feel intimidated, rushed, or taken for granted. I would highly recommend this business for almost any type of electronics or equipment you need. Oh and the best part besides everything else is their pricing.
Positive	My first visit here I had the hangover sandwich... WOW! I was hooked immediately. The Daily Dose Burger is always prepared to my liking, the Prime Steak Salad is a huge salad and is a delight to my tastebuds! I would stay away from the gravy, it's not what you'd expect from breakfast gravy. The staff is quick, friendly, and on top of their game. I will visit here again and again!
Positive	"I have dined and have done take out at this location well in excess of 75 times since they opened. This review is more of a culmination of all of our experiences or at least what we experienced.

Service sometimes can be slow and sometimes it is fast, but at the end of the day all of the servers have been super nice and super sweet. They always take care of us extremely well.

There have been more than a few occasions in which we placed orders online for pickup only to not have them ready or even received. While sometimes it is a bit of an inconvenience, it does happen. Who ever is working the take out section, sometimes calls to say we have received your order and etc and some don't. I don't know what the standard is for the restaurant, but it might be something work figuring out.

The food is always hot and fresh. I love the idea of being able to put on whatever I want on the burger no questions asked. Being from the east coast I am used to really good cheesesteaks, and when they had one as a special for a period of time I was a little weary of trying it, but I must say that it was one of the best cheesesteaks that I have had out here in Vegas.

Portion sizes on the sides are always good, more than enough to keep one happy. The only complaint is sometimes the onion rings are just way to greasy. 

Limited dessert menu, but the Oreo Mousse Mountain is awesome and I skip the milkshakes and etc so that I can enjoy this dessert.

Overall a place worth checking out at least once."
Positive	Decided to watch this show in the last minute bc I got a good deal. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I brought my two kids with me and they both loved it. Before the show, everyone grabbed a drumstick plus a pot to make noise during the show. A must see for ladies and families with kids.
Positive	"Have been to many of your branches. Found this cute one on McDowell Road near Goodyear we went again right before Thanksgiving. Had a great server her name was Britt. Out of all the Red Robin Gourmet Burgers we have gone to with our family I would go back if I could sit in her section only she was pleasant she represents you very well and we have had some horrible servers there. She constantly runs I've seen her clean her own tables my daughter is a fast food MCD server so I know what it's like she is a good representation of your establishment and should be known don't know how long she's been there don't know how long she works with you what I do know is that I will come back to the one on McDowell and I drove an hour to get there. Always want to say that I give good and bad when it's deserved she deserves a raise. 
I really think you're losing money on your bottomless fries as great as you think they are I don't believe people are ordering your appetizers we honestly could say we didn't I would've like something besides french fries but I think you need to rethink that one. 
See you next time 

Thanks 
Mike"
Positive	"This is HANDS DOWN the best buffet in Vegas, better yet, the world! They have soooo much to choose from, literally ANYTHING you can think of. My lady and I went here a couple months ago and we were blown away. My favorite thing about this buffet - HUGE king crab legs, hot or cold. The best part about their crab legs is they cut them in half so you literally just pull the meat right out and drench in lemon butter, no time wasted making a mess trying to crack them open! Their dessert selection is incredible!! My favorites were their macarons and the fresh made gelato. 

This is the most expensive buffet I've ever been to, I believe it was $60/person. BUT, it is soooo worth it!! Money well spent if you ask me.

Whether you're a Vegas local or a tourist here for the weekend, you MUST go here if you're looking for the best buffet possible!"
Positive	I stopped by here without any planning, I was just hungry. I was pleasantly surprised with superb service and food. I had a spinach calzone, which was well priced at just $3. It is conveniently located at the center of downtown Cleveland and it is pretty much on the way to anything. The Lebanese owner was kind and helpful as I made my selection and I would definitely visit again to try some of the unique dishes in this cornerstone cafe.
Positive	I have seen many reviews on here about how good Christina is. Today I walked in and Christina was who they called to wax my eyebrows. She kept my eyebrows exactly how they look but trimmed them and got rid of any stray, unnecessary hairs. This was the least painful visit I've ever had for my eyebrows before. Every time I come in here I never schedule an appointment and they can still get me in and sometimes even within 5 minutes. I go in every couple of weeks to get my eyebrows waxed because it's so cheap and they always do a good job. I've also gotten my nails done here before and they always do just as good of a job on my nails as they do with my eyebrows. They're always friendly and sociable. I would recommend this place to anyone. However, if you're in a hurry, I wouldn't count on a walk in. Sometimes they're busier than other times. Although, they'll always get you in as soon as possible.
Positive	"This is probably my favorite place to go !!

100 sauces ..really good wings ... great atmosphere ... good people

So much more fun and better food than any chain

Teriyaki and barbecue are tasty hot is classical and the hotter sauces are all there if you dare !!

Real food.  Real people. Real good

Thanks Bryan and Trisha !!"
Positive	"Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be rich?  Be more refined?  You know, go to high-end fancy shmancy places?  

My friend, welcome to the place where millionaires shop for groceries.  

Okay, I have no idea if that statement is accurate.  But, how many grocery stores do you go to that play classical music?  

This place pays a lot of attention to detail and it shows.  The store is very clean, bright, well laid out, and bears a friendly staff that is eager to help.  The produce department is world-class, with fresh clean produce that doesn't disappoint.  

I think what I appreciate the most about this place is the huge deli and prepared foods section.  If you're in need of a ready made meal or something hot and tasty, this is the place to get it.  

One downside is the selection.  The store and aisles are too small to accommodate a large selection, so don't expect to find 13 different brands of canned diced tomatoes.  But they do have a generic brand for most items.  

The prices are a bit high, but not unreasonable.  In this case, you're paying more for the shopping experience and the quality of products.  

Also, parents, they have nice carts with attached cars.  Plus a tiny cart with a flag on it that says ""Customer in training.""  When you're shopping with a two year old, that is HUGE.

Bottom line, I like this place a lot.  I just wish their prices were a bit lower.  But I'm willing to pay the premium for the better experience than other stores in town."
Positive	"Chinese + Mexican? Does that even make sense? It did for me. To be fair, I came just for a snack between meals, so the small portions were not a problem. It is pricey for the portion sizes. 
But all of the items I had were very good. Mushroom tacos, great. Not sure what the sauce was (soy+?) but was tasty. ""Twenty vegetable"" fried rice was one of the best examples I had.
The sticky rice desert was non-traditional but excellent."
Positive	"Cardenas is the perfect market for me. The produce is exceptionally good. They have the best selection of dried and fresh chiles for authentic Mexican dishes. Same goes for their meat/butcher department. The bakery is the same as you would find in any Mexican pueblo offering traditional rolls, sweet cakes, as well as the sheet cake of your kid's dreams for his/her birthday. They make their own fresh tortillas sold by pound/kilo. Best of all, it's the ONLY place I know of that sells New Mexico-style blue corn tortillas -- fresh, sweet, frangrant and good. The little cafeteria/deli section whips up economical combo lunches of real (not ""americanized"") Mexican dishes. Their carnitas are delicious. Need a sheet of fresh, crisp chicharones? They have sheets of the fried pork skins as well as small pieces for snacking. Love this place."
Positive	Today I had a Sunday brunch in hair of the dog. The decorations were so cute and the dining experience was great. I had the egg Benedict with coffee as my order. The server was patient and the food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely come back another time. Highly recommend!
Positive	Was looking for a nice restaurant to eat at that was near to Vdara, good but not super pricey. This place fit the bill nicely. We had a 9:30pm reservation and was seated on time. The place was about 50% full. The service at the start was incredible but tapered off towards the end of the evening when they swapped out waiters on us. Wait staff however all very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. I started with Octopus which was delicious followed by the lobster pici. The pici was very nice indeed, tasty and pretty rich. The pasta itself was very dense and cooked al dente which took a little more effort to eat than perhaps it should have. It was a good size portion. I had a cheesecake for desert but at that point was too full to really appreciate it's intricate flavors. My wife started with the lobster salad which was also excellent followed by the Branzino, again delicious. Modern décor with a chilled yet sophisticated ambience. I wore a jacket but pretty sure you could dine here in a t-shirt if you wanted to. We dropped just over $300 for the evening including a modestly priced bottle of white wine. If this wasn't Vegas I would say it was not worth that kind of outlay. Seemed a little overpriced. But who knows.
Positive	I love their new revamped menu it's got so many yummy options that are light and fresh.  I loved their Southwest eggrolls and Shrimp salsa which is Ceviche and their Chinese salad is sooo Yummy too.  We'll be coming back for sure.
Positive	My review is about two months later  but better late than never. Overall I think it's a pretty nice place. The workers are very friendly but pretty expensive for a wash, cut and style I paid 80$. I know it's been a while since I had my hair cut but that seems a bit extreme to me.
Positive	"I called Mr. Clean yesterday... Last minute they fit me in for same day service. Matthew showed up right on time at 3pm as they said they would. Matthew did  a great job of explaining the process of cleaning. 

Stepped out to pick up lunch, by when I returned he had removed my dogs pee stains. I will definitely be using then again... Awesome job. Thx you Matt and Mr. Clean Carpets."
Positive	I have been for over 20 years and by far Yvonne is the best nail artist I have ever had.  She did a amazing job!! I am extremely happy to have found her.
Positive	Awesome cupcakes! I tried the shakes, but my goodness, the sweetness here will send you into a diabetic coma. The decor is cute, but I think it needs even more pink.
Positive	We had them create a living trust for us and I can't say enough about how pleasant they made our experience.  The attorney was very knowledgeable and walked us through everything, helped us make decisions and had suggestions we hadn't thought of.  The office assistant was organized and helpful also.  Everyone was very pleasant, professional and all in all, just great. Would go back to them again.
Positive	Went here for date night and the food was awesome!! We got the spring rolls 2 ways: chicken and veggie. The dipping sauce was delish! Then we had the hot pot soup with coconut and lime broth. It was such a neat presentation. Then we ordered the Thai basil and the pad Thai. Both dishes were great. I would defiantly be back!! Also it was rated by food networks drivers dine-ins and dives!!! 5 stars people!!!
Positive	"Of all the bars on Fremont, this place has the least scum. Let it be known, ALL venues in Downtown Las Vegas are loaded with scum. But this bar has the MINIMUM concentration of losers within a 5 mile radius. That's a GOOD thing.

I believe it's because of the crowd it attracts here, since the bar is more divey than loud and drama laden ""party spots"". Drinks are relatively cheap, $3 a pint for Hamms. 

Really, the only altercation I have so far here is some fat, hairy, loser motherfucker, and his fat hippo girlfriend not letting me pass the rear dance floor to get to the bar. Guy acts all angry and all, and I retaliate, give him a cold, sociopathic looking stare and stalked him across the spot to scare him away. And then it's done. Problem solved. They left. 

In my 4 years of living here and only having that ONE encounter, it actually puts The Griffin on a great track record believe it or not. 

Unlike other spots, the women here are open and friendly. Like me and my boy never required any openers at all, we just sat around until a pack of 7 white girls start waving us over. And after that, some seriously X-Rated stuff happened at the Hard Rock Hotel.

Decent prices, a usually great crowd, all of you should come over! Unless you are a scumbag sex offender or loser. Stay the fuck out.

Edit: 

While the inside of the Griffin is pretty relaxed versus the lousy atmosphere of Downtown Las Vegas, outside is a different story. 

I remembered walking to the Griffin one day and I came across a huge crowd gathering over a aftermath of a fight. There was a bouncer holding down a guy with a stab wound in his hand. Decided to hang around for a bit and watch the scene unfold. 

And then some old white dude goes up to me and starts rambling on about how Vegas is a ""Police State, MAN!"" and some other drivel that roughly translate to ""Fuck teh Pooh-leece!"".

Seriously? You are a 50+ year old GROWN man and you still bitch about ""The System""? Arn't you supposed to you know, retire from a great job and loving kids and shit? 

Loser."
Positive	"My husband and I had never heard of Western Pacific Insurance before but we looked them up on Yelp and were very happy we did. We were shopping for home insurance which had not done for years. We were greeted graciously at the door and met a very nice young man who found a policy for us $1000 cheaper than the one we had.  We were very happy and naturally changed to the new policy. Lots of savings for us. Thank you Western Pacific
Louise & Leon O"
Positive	"I've ordered a few things from here - baked lasagna, shrimp caesar, and the #24 pizza. 

The lasagna was delicious. The shrimp caesar was good but a bit wet for my liking. The garlic toast was perfect. And the pizza.....is the best I've had in years. 

My delivery experiences from Plato's are always great. The food comes quickly and the driver is always friendly. 

Definitely give this place a try. I have very high standards coming from Vancouver!!"
Positive	I bought a bag as a gift, but needed to exchange it because my very socially conscious GF wanted a different color.  Then I read the reviews about nightmare return experiences, and got nervous.  However, they responded to my email and facebook messages within 3 days, and processed the return quickly and with no issue.  I had to pay the return shipping cost, but that isn't unheard of or unreasonable, I feel.  The bag color and style was loved by my GF, along with their purported ethical manufacturing standards.
Positive	So very happy that the Gilbert location is open and judging by the crowds... So is everyone else. Okay the food is very good and creative. Servers are awesome and the bartenders are quick to make you smile. The chicken tenders are so flavorful you don't even need the dipping sauces. We had the pear and prosciutto flatbread which is great. Only disappointment was they ran out of Left hand milk stout. The bar manager actually came over to our table and apologized. That was really unexpected and a nice touch. They have an open kitchen and I love that. We also had the stuffed dates(very sweet) but they were good. We will return again and again. Tempe drive was too much and again so glad they are here!!!!!
Positive	"My husband purchased a remote start for my new Wrangler here. My experience with the staff was excellent. My remote start is excellent, and the cost was very reasonable. They talked to me about the differences between using my vehicle remote or a separate fob. I chose the separate fob, as they said the range would probably be greater. So far, I'm extremely satisfied with the product.

I will have them look at installing an auxiliary cable on my 2001 BMW radio in the spring when I take it out of storage. (That series radio does not have an auxiliary port in the back of the radio, so it is trickier.)

I'll update after my radio is updated."
Positive	"A good friend took me there for dinner,  I love seafood, I really enjoyed dinner!  For being in the desert the lobster was wonderful I had the Ucon roll it was simple and yummy!  Chunks of lobster on a toasted roll with melted butter and fries.

The lobster was cooked perfect and tasted awesome! 

I followed it up with a cup of lobster bisque creamy and hot loved it!

Stole a hush puppy from my friend and it was awesome too, also got to try the lobster quesadilla, everything we tried was great.

I would recommend this place anytime 
and to those who say the sandwich didn't have a pound and fourth of lobster should know lobster is sold and weighed IN THE SHELL so that adds to it just FYI"
Positive	What a diamond in the ruff!! It was like walking into a time warp. The wood all around. Easy to read menu with lots of choices and also a large selection of chips. Everything is made to order with fresh ingredients. Plus you can add chips and a drink for $1.00!! Where you gonna find that these days. I had a chicken Cesar wrap with the dressing on the side. Everything was fresh. There was a line when I walked in but it moved pretty fast. They also have a daily special.
Positive	"I really enjoyed Native Tongues in spite of some issues.  The Mescal list alone is enough to guarantee a good time. Native Tongues kitchen is authentic.  Don't expect Anglo influenced Mexican food.  Our brisket and pork belly tacos were fab. Guacamole is fresh and everything tastes good.  Service is professional and fun, making your dining experience a good time.
The one caveat is the size of the tables.  They are just too small for comfort.  This is food meant to be shared, and the tables make this very difficult.  However, that will not stop me from returning to Native Tongues."
Positive	Love this place. I found Tempe Dental Care on Yelp when I moved up here a few years ago and been going back ever since. Heather, my hygienist is amazing. So nice and friendly and does a spectacular job. I switched insurances and wanted to get in ASAP so she fit in with another hygienist, Katie, who was great as well. I love the staff and most importantly the care they take to educate you on your oral care. Yes I use sensodyne and have a sonicare and glide floss.....and my smile has never been better.
Positive	One of my favorite spots! Whether you're looking for a spot to hit for taco Tuesday ( be forewarned about the crowds) or somewhere to go for awesome drinks before hitting the town, Fuzzy's is your place. I love their beer-a-rita's, especially the morning glory - mini champagne bottle in a GIANT glass of frozen strawberry/lime margarita mix (I substitute the lime with pina colada flavored).
Positive	"You literally cannot find a better bar than this one in Miracle Mile.  I spent the last three days there (not counting today, because reality made me leave... darn!) and met some really amazing people (both people that work there and patrons).

It's a huge place, and yes... they have a mechanical bull you can ride (no, I don't ride the bull).

Basically it's three bars and a patio.  For me, the smaller back bar was comfortable.  I tried the big front bar and, while it was still fun, I just kinda felt more comfortable back in the back.  Even when it was busy, it was home.

I won't name names (mainly because I don't think I can find all my card receipts), but everybody that worked in the back while I was there... thank you for making my latest Vegas trip something to remember.

Cheers, and Jameson on the rocks for everyone!  :)

*** Update:

I forgot.  The metal bar stools in the back bar... they seriously suck.  Please switch them out with something with some cushion?  Thanks!"
Positive	PoolStar does an excellent job. Kevin is very good about communicating with us and recommending service people for mechanical problems. Cody, who does our pool, is terrific. He never complains about climbing over barrier that keeps our puppy away from the pool and is great with the pup! He deserves a special thank you.
Positive	"Blessed to have wonderful friends one of whom decided to treat me to a day here. 

I've never been to a spa so I don't have much to compare this to but I had a lovely time. Amenities include access to the hotel's gym, a ""Roman baths"" room w 3 pools--hot, room temp, and cold, a sauna, steam room, snow room, and a larger room with a large hot tub. While relaxing you also have access to a few snacks-- pretzels, bananas, or apples, as well as a variety of drinks. 

The ladies side has a lounge area as well as room to get ready in with everything you need for your hair. I especially enjoyed the sterilizers for hair brushes. The showers are also impressive. 

I'm docking a star for a couple of reasons: we were here on a Friday. It was hardly what one would call busy, however there were just too many dirty towels everywhere. It was off putting. Also, the price tag is just a little much for me. $65 is a lot when all you're doing is hopping from different water baths. The gym access did make it more worth it, but I wish there was more incentive. For instance, I would have loved a complementary mimosa or 2 (with the option to buy more). I know booze and bodies of water may not be the best combo but I think this would be a nice activity for a bachelorette or something."
Positive	"The best food I have ever had in my life. I went here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriends and they made me feel so special. Here is why I love this place:

1. Phillip our waiter was amazing. He gave use complementary champagne and lemon drops. He was very knowledgable and attentive.
2. The food is worth the price. Large portions that tasted amazing. I ordered the salmon and it was delicious. My girlfriends meals were also so good.
3. They also gave me mini cakes for my birthday. 

A great place for a night out with that special
Someone or with the girls. My fav restaurant in Vegas."
Positive	Mike Jones did a fantastic job on everything I asked for. I could tell he knew what he could take care of and if I was asking for something that would may not be a good spot to take care of. We do have quite a few pests here in Dewey that can get out of control and he added some extra strength on those areas close to the house. Thank you Mike, youre a great listener and very courteous.!
Positive	WOW!!!  What can I say without sounding like an infomercial.  Jamie and Raphael were great along with Jeff's brother (wish I could remember his name).  The appointment was for 8 AM and Jeff's brother was here before than to look over the job and right behind was Jamie and Raphael.  Not many contractors actually show up on time but this company does.  Now for the quality of the work. Can we give you more than 5 stars as you definitely deserve this.  They moved furniture and replaced the furniture as if nothing had changed.  The crown molding is installed so perfect that you cannot see a seam even while studying the ceiling.  They painted the molding, touched up the wall paint and cleaned the floors so no dust or debris was left behind.  We had 4 rooms done and all this only took them 6 hours.  They are pleasant, cheerful, and actual fun to have in your house.  We could not be more pleased with what this company did for us in both price and quality and this started with the first visit from Jeff to measure the rooms and help us decide on the style of molding.  We have already given their name and number to many neighbors.
Positive	"I would have to agree with most of the reviews here! 

One of the best dining experiences in Vegas! I have been to Craftsteak, L'Atelier, Mesa Grill,  Nobhill, and N9NE but Le Cirque outshone them all with their wonderful service and great food. 

I felt it was a bit stuffy but our group was lively so we made the restaurant work around our mood. :) 

The best part was the fantasy desserts for my friends birthday. The chocolate souffle is a MUST!!!!

Definitely go and you will not be disappointed! :) 

Also, they give the ladies a tiny jewelry case and put truffles in it. the coconut one is super delish!"
Positive	I've had a very pleasant experience with secured auto glass. The man was very polite and honest. Someone broke into my car smashing my quarter panel window so it was really refreshing to be treated like one of the family after feeling so vulnerable, they even vacuumed out all the glass in my back seat! The price of the replacement was exceptionally low, I was expecting to pay at least double what he charged me and he guarentees the work for the life of the car, even without a receipt. All in all I recommend secured auto glass. They are great!
Positive	Finally hit the High Park Rawalicious location.  Beautiful interior with a grand piano tucked in the back.  I had the soft taco with a side salad and some yummy warm tomato soup which was delicious!
Positive	Hey!  They filtered my review out apparently because it seemed like an owner may have written it!  That's crazy!  This is the best starbucks by far.  I go to a lot of different locations for work and I never get such friendly service as I do at this location.  The mornings are sooo busy there but they are always so smiley and friendly.  Love it!
Positive	So happy to see a vegan restaurant here on the west side.  We come from 83rd & Bell to eat here.  This is our second of many future meals here. No meat, no gmo & yet organically delicious!
Positive	AJ, Robert, Jacob, and D moved my fiancé and I today and they were incredible!! So hardworking and very careful and diligent. We were pleased from the jump with the service provided when we were getting a quote and scheduling our move. I have moved around AZ a number of times and this was by far the smoothest move thus far. Can't thank JITM enough!!
Positive	We stayed with my wife in Las Vegas in Ballys Hotel. We ordered a couple of Swedish massage in massage 2Go. Girls arrived at the appointed time and brought 2 massage table. They fit easily in our room. they had a great relaxing music! I was so relaxed during the massage, which fell asleep twice! massage was wonderful, better than I have ever received! She knew exactly what places for a massage, where my tired muscles. My wife was satisfied! this price of $ 200 for two, very less for mobile massage! Thank you for the excellent work!
Positive	We just went in for a cat litter box. But, the store was very clean and well stocked. The lady at the register was very nice as well and helped us get the PETCO card to get extra savings sometimes.
Positive	Went for a quick bite and beer.  We ordered the pork pot stickers and the Rainbow roll. Pot stickers were yummy, but they served 5 instead of 6 so they could be shared equally. The rainbow roll had Atlantic salmon, avocado and cream cheese (my date's favorite ingredients and it was very fresh and the rice was perfect.  The wasabi   and ginger were also very fresh. The waiter was extremely attentive without being bothersome. Decor was very nice.
Positive	"Great shop that is a little under-appreciated in Montreal.

Very well-stocked with an excellent selection of brands, many that you can't get elsewhere (like Lemaire.. well, apart from SSENSE but who shops at SSENSE?). Definitely high / ultra high-end, but everything is beautiful and well-designed.

Worth a visit for men's and women's clothing & an intimate vibe with very knowledgable staff."
Positive	Best ever quiche, just like custard. Can't wait to go back and they finish every meal with a brownie bite. Which is really unfair because they are so delicious, yikes! Ham and cheese or spinach, amazing...
Positive	"Found this place on a random google search and I am so glad I did. They did such a good job. My suit was way too big and I was nervous they wouldn't be able to get it to fit right. I am very impressed with the quality. It only took a week, was fairly priced, and fits great. Thanks!

PS. They only take cash or check. Not a big deal just want to inform. Had to drive half a mile up the road for an ATM"
Positive	Been here a few times now and I love it! Really big, open space. Lovely outdoor area. Casual, nicely done interior as well. Food is great, but limited menu options, but it will probably expand soon. My favorites are the turkey pastrami sandwich, cheese curds, and brats, so good! Service is pretty good. Looks like it has 2 bars inside and 1 that isn't up yet, outdoors. Im looking forward to frequenting this place when it heats up. It's got such great potential for a sunday funday spot.
Positive	"I highly recommend Stell roofing. Mike was and fair and quick with his quote. After taking other quotes, which were not as attractive, we decided to go with Stell. They were able to get us in in less then a week. He sent over Sergio's crew which were on time and all very courteous and hard working. The job took a little over a day and it looks great. They ended up having to do extra work on my roof and Mike was very fair with the price. I felt like I was very well taken care of.

Positive	"Very nice hotel, easily seen from the highway. I was impressed with the decor of the place from the entrance to my room. The room was fantastic - great decor, felt warm and cozy while providing lots of convenience like indoor pool, workout room, free parking and internet (up to 6 wireless devices). I was told the shower was recently renovated. My son definitely enjoyed using the shower before and after going to the pool. We ordered food wings and kids burger - great all around. Very tasty, the wings were definitely not dry, over cooked ala chicken jerky. 

My only complaint is the refrigerator, its setup with a 2 hour timer to be on and 8 hrs for off. It seems completely out of place. What's the point of staying the night and leaving anything in a fridge that is only cold for two hours? I was better off filling up my cooler with lots of ice and using the cooler. Good to know the next time i encounter such a useless fridge - avoid at all cost."
Positive	Great staff , a luxury spa experience to go and get a good haircut. I was welcomed as soon as i walked in with the girl at the front offering to tske my jacket, put on a salon robe for me and asking me if i wanted a tea or coffee. The japanese girl who was my sttlist led me to her chair to talk about cut options then brought me to a automated reclinable chair at the wash station. Amazing massage was given and the cut was awesome! Can't wait to come back here! The place is also so new and modern and in the middle of everything!
Positive	I love this place! I've been to several foot spas, and this is one of my favorites. They usually get me in right away and start the massage quickly. It is clean and usually very quiet and relaxing. You can't beat this massage for $20! For those complaining about the tip- these people work hard for an hour straight. Nowhere else in Vegas are you going to get a massage for $20, so stop being so cheap. If you can't afford to tip $15 then you probably shouldn't go. It's only $35 total for an hour massage!
Positive	Great atmosphere friendly service and delicious foods. We went there on Saturday for lunch. We're group of eight people (includes 4 kids). The dressing for the house salad was made by their chef, not store brought salad dressing. We had temperatura shrimps and veggies, their signatures rolls, sushi pizza, a mixed of sushi & sashimi, etc. Portions were great! We're all very satisfied! We're going back for teppanaki next time.
Positive	"Really a cute place.  I loved patio area and thought the service was great.  Big giant Oreganos-sized soda cups kept me happy and the crowd was a great mix of people.  Also, there was no wait on a Saturday morning which is a good thing since we drove by Over Easy and there was a small mob standing outside.

As far as the food goes, it was okay.  On par with Denny's or IHOP, I guess.  The hashedbrowns were overly hashed and turned to mashed.  The breakfast sandwich I had was pretty tasty but was only saved by the massive amount of cheese on it.  

I might got back but there are so many other options.  I give it four stars simply because no wait, food is adequate, and the service is excellent."
Positive	This is it!! This place rocks! Affordable, quality pieces that are eclectic and diverse. We got an amazing deal on a kids bed. They even have a play room to entertain your littles while you shop. The inventory moves fairly fast, so if you want it ... Buy it.
Positive	I had the nom nom burger because Kobe beef, cheddar and chips on a burger sounds delicious, and it was. My wife had the gold standard and we preferred each other's burger. The chocolate shake was good as well. They serve alcoholic ice cream specialty shakes but they looked a bit much for me. The portions are big here so you will be full.
Positive	Buddyz was really good. They're still working out some kinks (holy cow we need some soft furniture in there to help with the noise) but overall the pizza was good, wine was good, mozz appetizer was yum (love the sauce to dip). We'll be back, for sure.
Positive	"I was craving Italian but wanted to try a new restaurant. Tucked into the corner of a small strip mall with private outside dining and a cute Tuscan theme inside, I was happy with the atmosphere. I wanted to try a seafood pasta dish but the menu didn't have exactly what I was looking for but the server was happy to make my dish to order, yay! I ordered fish and shrimp with a tomato cream sauce and my husband ordered the Frutti deMarre (sp?). Both were out to the table quickly and were delicious! My meal consisted of large shrimp and Mahi Mahi. My husband kept saying how great his meal was. In fact, he said that he decided before he got his meal that he would only eat half since he wasn't that hungry. He ended up eating the entire meal it was so good. My meal was the perfect amount of pasta, seafood and sauce and the shrimp and Mahi were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all.

I couldn't really give 5 stars due to the lettuce in our salads having pink stalks (you know, the color it gets when it is starting to get old). I also wasn't a fan of the salad dressing due to it tasting of too much oil. I did take the pickled portion of the salad off. Not sure what it was but my husband thought it was amazing  and I'm sure was meant to balance the oil in the dressing.

We'll definitely be back to try the Lobster Ravioli."
Positive	The most AMAZING BBQ spot in town! I love this place! Meat falling off the bone and don't you dare touch my plate...I will bite. God sauce and Fallen Angel sauce are so amazing; the perfect amount of heat with the perfect amount of lots of flavor. I've had pretty much everything off the menu but my favorites are the pork ribs, beef short ribs, brisket and corn with that delish rubbed flavored butter. Did I mention how the meat falls into your mouth, so moist and flavorful Oh my.... Let's talk about the catering, I had my birthday catered for about 20 people of family and friends and everyone fell in love just as much I was. I also pick up lunch here for me and my co-workers and they are in love as well. Prices are awesome and so are the portions. If you want to support a true local that just so happens to have amazing food look no further than Jessie Rae's.
Positive	"Tried this place while visiting Phoenix for work.

Great spot for lunch. I got the chorizo burrito enchilada style. It was huge, but ingredients were so flavorful I had to clean my plate.

Price was a bargain and the owner even gave me one of their famous empanadas to go since it was my first time visiting.

I highly recommend."
Positive	Hayley was really great! We came on National Tequila Day and they really were great with their service. The tequila was good, live band was very interactive and the food was great! The food was very good.
Positive	"Dropped in for a quick outpatient surgery.  Check in was quick and effective.  Surgery went well.
 
Show time was 1230 and the surgery was scheduled for 230.  Went into surgery at 400.  Not a complaint, just an observation.  Just understand that after check in  times are estimates.  Also the later in the day you are scheduled for the more delay will be built in.  Oddly the guy in the pre op room next to me couldn't figure that out...he complained loudly and often.

My only real complaint is that I specifically asked about having a lidocaine shot before they inserted the IV and when the time came to do it, no lidocaine.  Not really pleased about that."
Positive	"We went here to celebrate our daughters birthday. We were a large party of seven people. 

Make sure to ask for Cameron, his service is far superior from any server I've ever had. He was amazing. He took the time to learn our names, he was very good at his job. We even gave Cameron high marks to his supervisor. If you love Red Lobster and want a server who truly loves his job, make sure to ask for him. You won't regret it."
Positive	"This was the best moving experience I ever had, and I move a lot for work, so that's saying a lot! I was 30 minutes late for my appointment, but they were very gracious and waited for me. I was not charged extra. The owner, Trace Edwards, called and confirmed my appointment, and let me know he was only a phone call away if there was a problem.

     The men that participated in  my move were professional and courteous. They loaded my belongings in record time, working straight through until the  job was completed.  I highly recommend this company, and plan to use them  for any future moving needs.  I am a very satisfied customer!"
Positive	I don't know why I always forget to write a review of this place, my family have been regulars for years. The $1 congee is definitely amazing for congee lovers. Simple but great tasting bowls of congee. However, my favourite things on the menu is definitely their noodles and pan fried dumplings. All of their noodle dishes are amazing. Their hand pulled noodles are amongst the best I've had around here, and portions are huge. Their dumplings are super juicy and just addicting. Their menu has a large selection of food and everything I've ever tried I was pretty impressed with, especially given their price point. My family will obviously continue to be regulars and I definitely recommend anyone to try their noodles.
Positive	"I love this place. I have strategically gotten my coworkers addicted to Grouchy's, so that I have an excuse to make an afternoon coffee run.

I am not big on hot coffee, so I usually stick to frappes. They feature a signature drink every Monday for half off, which is a really good way to try things. My favorite is the Butter Me Up, but all of them are amazing. I've honestly never had a bad drink.

I have recently been trying to watch my sugar, and if you're in the same boat I highly recommend the Skinny ARM. It's seriously amazing.. it doesn't taste skinny at all. 

Their service is always excellent whether you go in and through the drive-thru. My only complaint - there's not one by my house."
Positive	"Do yourself a favor and go through the drive thru. Stood at the walk up window for over 5 mins while 6 girls focused on the drive thru. I never complain but today's service was horrible!
Worst part is I could see the coffee looked clear as she was pouring it. Tasted horrible and I threw it out and went to starbucks!"
Positive	"This is worth every penny if you plan well and have a huge appetite.

Buffet of the buffet is $59.99 on weekdays (Sunday 11:01am to Friday 10:59 am and $79.99 (Friday 11:01 to Sunday 10:59am). These prices are for total rewards members and good for 24 hours per person. I think for non members its $5 more. 

Here are my reviews on the following buffets arranged according to my choice and what I think is best:

1. Rio carnival- various choices. They have different types of cuisines of Italian, Asian, Mexican and American. They also have salad bars and dessert stations. The area is huge and spacious. One of the favorites here is the made to order soups.

2. Paris Le Village Buffet- I like their made to order crepes. Crepes can be dessert or meal of your choice. They also have meat cutting sections from beef to pork.. They have good egg's benedict too. And you can get mimosa drink for free.

3. Spice Market on Planet Hollywood- They have good choices also and what stands out here is their stuffed sole which is made of fish and crab. You can find this in their seafood section. They have good meat stuffed cheese lasagna as well and pesto pasta.

4. Harrah's flavors- They have good options too like Spice Market but its more spacious here. They have funny way of food categories(splash,ciao,ole and prime). 

5. Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet- They have good set up where you can see flamingos and japanese koi fishes from where you are seated but the food is not that great compared to the four mentioned. It's standard American food even. You might find made to order burger good here if you like that.

Overall this is a good experience. My husband and I were happy not to mention stuffed to try this."
Positive	"What's better than grabbing some delicious pizza after a good hardcore workout! I had pizza on my mind the whole time I was deadlifting and wanted to try out this new pizza place in Surprise next to in & out for lunch with my little toddler. 

There were a lot of parking which was awesome and the line wasn't too long. I even found out that they have cauliflower pizza crust now which I must try next time. I love thin crust and if you do too, you'll love this place! 

Here's what I ordered. Original crust, garlic and herb with light marinara, cheese, mushroom, olives and green peppers and onions. 

My toddler got the bambino cheese pizza which was super cute little pizza for a tiny human! 

Verdict: not soggy, crispy, veggies were fresh! And the sauce is perfect! Not greasy at all! We didn't wait too long neither so I say THIS IS A WIN! I was raving about this place to my husband who unfortunately didn't get a taste so we will be back soon. 

They also gave me a military discount as I am a wife of a veteran. I love discounts"
Positive	"Is it illegal to steal two cute Vietnamese women and take them home? I'm gonna go with yes. 

Yummy Cafe is a little ma and pa spot tucked away in the bottom of a commercial building by my office in the NE. It's very small with about eight seats and a little service counter. Basic handmade signs are strewn about with the menu items and daily specials. It's really cute. It's what you would think it is-deep friend treats, burgers, sandwiches and a number of quick Asian dishes. All of that said, they are sooooo friendly you want to come back just to say hi. The food is pretty good (I love the Yummy Sub which is their Vietnamese sub), the burgers are yummy with fries and the grilled cheese is also a treat. They stocks lots of drinks, chips, bars and snacks for that 2:30 craving as well. Likely no one will ever be by this place unless you work within a one block radius and can walk on your lunch break-which thankfully I do.

April challenge 10/30"
Positive	Recently ended our night at Two Scoops and it was exactly what we needed. They have a lot of different flavors (and it appears they rotate regularly) and are very generous with their scoops! The outside is a little run down and could use some attention, but I loved the mural inside and the friendly staff. I'll be back!
Positive	"**Great Service
**Great Prices, definitely ask about any coupons they can apply. 
The store is very clean, coffee was hot! Time of the service was as expected. 
So far I have had all of the engine mounts changed out, four brake pads, two rear shocks, two control arms, oil change. Some parts I had of my own, and they just charged labor which was a plus++!! 
Over all experience was outstanding compared to other brake/car auto shop. Very polite, and at no point the employees made me feel overwhelmed, in a professional manner they let me know what part was of concern immediately, and what I could take my time in saving up and coming back for. 

The person who gave me great service at this location was Greg (floating manager) so you won't see him at a particular store every time , very patient man I tell you! 
The other location, I have had good service with Jerry on 51st and Bell."
Positive	"I have been here a couple of times now...... Really good sandwiches....
First, they are closed on Mondays! Made that mistake once....
Second, its a stand... just a stand... only one or two plastic tables outside in the parking lot....just, wish I could sit inside and eat my wonderful sandwich!!!
Now the food is great!
I have had the Reuben-ish... really good..... I Love the Chicken.... Love the Grilled Cheese (I added tomato)
Not a fan of the radish.... the butter was just too much for my taste... they put a lot of butter.... the radish and sprouts were great!
I plan on going through the whole menu.... one sandwich at a time!"
Positive	Came here from California on a business trip with 11 co-workers and we all had a great experience. The pizza was delicious and the service was great! It had a very warm, family style setting.
Positive	My wife and I love this place.  The Modern Life dealer, who has 3 booths is probably our favorite in the bunch, however we have found a lot of great mid century modern pieces here at great prices.
Positive	"Came here with some girlfriends for an afternoon bite/happy hour. I'm from Minnesota. Happy hour seven days a week is unheard of. What a deal. Especially with $5 glasses of wine! Any single one on the menu. 

The bruschetta is amazing--recommend the apples and goat cheese. De-lish!

Service could be toned down somewhat; very helpful but maybe a little TOO helpful."
Positive	"So many beautiful horsepower filled cars to drool over are a quick drive away from the strip. Free tour? Sign me up. Great selection of Shelby muscle are on display even if you don't have time/desire for the tour. The gift shop is great, you are bound to find something for yourself and the other car lovers in your life. 

We really enjoyed the tour guide (forget his name but he is in one of Ariel's photos). He knew everything about Shelby. One of the highlights was writing our names on the wall by the garage (gearhead ground zero :) ). Thousands of people from all over the world have done the same and it is a great way to leave a semi-permanent mark on the place.

Carroll Shelby may not be on this earth, but his dream for high performance/horsepower vehicles lives on and I only wish I had the bank account to afford one of the vehicles for sale in the showroom. 

Vrooooom!!"
Positive	"Gord and I walked to the Keg for supper.  It opened in October 2014 and we've been wanting to check it out.

The restaurant was full so we sat in the lounge, which was jammed by the time we left.

Tori was our server and she started us off with some warm bread.  Yum!

Gord ordered the Seafood Chicken Deluxe with rice.  He said it was good and he'd order it again.

I ordered the 14 oz prime rib with mashed potatoes and it too was delicious.  I was given an end piece and it seemed huge ... sweet!  Yes, I'd get it again.

Tori was friendly and helpful.

Our only complaint is that the lounge was really really warm."
Positive	"This was the first time we tried a pasty, and we loved it! This place is just perfect. Great ambience, food and superb collection of beers. The selection was perfect for anyone and everyone!!! The table had the Pilgrim, Chicken Pesto, Italian, and Salmon Caesar!!!! Dinner was absolutely amazing and oh so filling.....But we were at the counter and saw all the desserts come out so we knew that dessert was a must!! We ordered Banoffee and Caramel Apple Crisp Pasty.....Such a great choice and fantastic way to end the evening!! Thank you Cornish Pasty for an amazing experience

We will definitely be going back here again!"
Positive	Was looking forward for some good food accompanied with a good time and received just that and more. The service was 5 star the seafood was beyond amazing. We started off with the oysters and seafood salad which was delicious ! For main we had the skirt steak and the ahi tuna steak! Wowzer... the ahi was the best I ever had!!! Defiantly coming back when in town!!!
Positive	This is some of the best Chinese food in Ahwatukee! I recommend the Mongolian beef or shrimp lo mein. The lunch special is unbeatable. Great service. Family owned and operated. I've been going here for over 10 years and it has never disappointed me. Easily 5 stars
Positive	Ordered chicken on the rocks... Words cannot describe how good this dish is. seasoned chicken shawarma on buttery rice drenched in taziki, tahini, and there hot sauce(i would buy bottles of this sauce if i could).The only downsides to this place is customer service isn't the greatest, but i'm gonig to gie them the benefit of the doubt i've only gone during lunch time and theyre slammed. also if you want anything extra such as lettuce, onions, turnips, tomatoes, etc it's $0.50 each... what a rip off
Positive	I think Grouchy John's just keeps getting better every time I go. Or maybe I just enjoy everything so much. For a while I was stuck on Iced Mocha Lattes but after the trying the Honey Latte, it is my new favorite. I'm so bad too, I usually order a coffee and a smoothie each time I visit. I'm Longing for their special the MPC (Mango, Pineapple, Cherry) to make a re-appearance but the Strawberry Banana is keeping me happy for now. Which is weird cause I don't really like bananas. The last sojourn to where they were camped out on Goldring I brought some of my office with me. I ordered two different iced coffees. The special that day was a Matcha Green Tea and Kiwi smoothie. I sooo wanted to try it but I was not feeling the vibe for green tea that day. My clerk told me it was very light and refreshing. Oh, well maybe next time. They hand out candy with every drink order, as if I really needed any more sugar ...
Positive	It's tough to find somewhere in Vegas serving breakfast opposed to brunch...the Henry fits the bill. We ordered Traditional eggs Benedict on toast with a side of hollandaise & it was very good. You can't really go too wrong with breakfast but it was still very good. They also serve fresh oj.
Positive	This is the best place for anyone who needs gluten free and vegan treats! Cookies, breads, red velvet cupcakes are so good,  I get them every time I go! Friendly and always smiling staff makes this a wonderful stop for me every other week!
Positive	Came here in Father's Day and I must say it was quite and not packed at all. I really enjoyed this spot. I tried the watermelon summer splash drink and loved it, if you like lemonade and fresh watermelon fruit then this drink is a must try. Recently went to Cracker Barrel and had the biscuits and gravy and was disappointed. IHOP brought my love for the recipe back to life. Saw the combo on the menu and jump in receiving four soft biscuits smothered in gravy not given to me on the side in a bowl. My daughter had the Nutella Crepes which she loved and I gotta say was pretty good as well. I also could go to IHOP without getting pancakes! So I threw in a stack of raspberry chocolate chip pancakes and it was heaven. Sorry Cracker Barrel I WIN, YOU LOSE, THIS GAME!
Positive	This place had me at carrot cake. Serendipity 3 is infamous for their $1K gold sundae, but I was most attracted to their carrot cake concoction. I love carrot cakes and this was so delicious. Moist layers of this spicy cake filled with cream cheese frosting topped with whipped cream and white chocolate drizzles and shavings. This decadent hunk of a cake was sitting atop of bowl of walnut-mixed ice cream. This big portion is probably meant but sharing, but I just wanted it all to myself. One of the best carrot cakes I've had, hands down!
Positive	"Had a hernia repaired a month ago. The level of care here was truly unbelievable! I've been to several hospitals (unfortunately) though, I have never been subject to such a level of medical pampering in my life!  I was merely there on an outpatient basis to have a minor operation performed and I actually wound up feeling rather undeserving of all the attention that I received for such a routine matter.

I also believe that the Dominican St Rose-San Martin campus is also an excellent hospital as well. However, the staff members at Southern Hills truly go the extra mile. Thanks!"
Positive	"I shop here all the time for all my grocery needs, they always have fresh meats and produce unlike some of the competitors in the neighborhood. I often visit these others stores just to make sure I'm getting awesome deals, and trust me going to Albertsons you are.. I bought some steaks at a store just down the street who IS a major competitor and boy was I in for a world or hurt, the quality of the meat way something out of a elementary lunch line, just horrible.

They usually have great deals here on meats and seafood not to mention some of the cheapest alcohol in town, at varying times of course. I will continue to shop here just for that reason alone. 4/5 stars cause sometimes the customer service can be a bit sluggish and not knowledgeable. 

Cheers and happy shopping!"
Positive	"I want to give this place 5 stars but . . . 

This location is right across the street from where I work but it was my first time visiting this evening. I have been to a couple other locations around town and all are nice and clean with a friendly staff. Business is nice and steady for them which is always a good sign. Their flavors and toppings are good and at the very least on-par with their competitors here in town. I think they could have just a few more toppings. I didn't see any chopped nuts but I could have overlooked it. Not a big deal though. Plenty of other toppings to choose from. You can have as much yogurt or as little as you want and are charged accordingly, which is nice.

Like I said, the staff at all the Yogurtland locations I have been to around town have all been very nice and polite. However, what I don't get is that there is a tip jar at the register. To me, tips are given based on service, primarily, or if a someone from the staff goes beyond their job duties to accommodate a customer. A waiter/waitress, porter, hair stylist, pizza delivery and taxi drivers are some examples. This place is a *self-service* operation. The only ""service"" provided by the staff is ringing up the order and taking my payment. That part is no different from cashiers working at grocery, retail, and convenience stores. Again, Yogurtland is not the only self-service yogurt shop here in town that does this. 

All in all, it's a pleasant experience and I will be a repeat customer. I just find it a little silly to have a tip jar set up at a self-service place. Thus, the 4 out of 5 stars from me."
Positive	"Fat Heads Saloon was the first place we eat out at after moving back to Pittsburgh. The entire 18-hour drive back to Pittsburgh my husband talked about Fat Heads' wings. Our first Monday in Pittsburgh, we headed here for wing night. Unfortunately, their wings on special are not gluten free, but I was able to order the whole wings which were gluten free.

The Fat Heads original sauce is a good enough to drink (or at the very least douse all over your meal). They have a great selection of drinks and food, but we seem to venture here more for wings than anything else."
Positive	"This place had the most unique and delicious ice cream flavors I've ever seen! Such an impressive and surprising treat. I had at least half a dozen samples before I made my choice, and each sample made it more and more difficult to choose! 

I finally went with a shake made with orange/pineapple and vanilla. It was like the best creamsicle ever. So refreshing! 

Even more sweet and refreshing were the owners. They were helpful and patient, even though we showed up 10 minutes before closing time! Will definitely be back when we are in the area again"
Positive	"Went to Fat Cats for the first time on a Tuesday night for the $5 movies they have. This place was packed! Who knew?! We purchased tickets online ahead of time and got to picks our seats. This was very nice since we didn't have to run to the theater to find a good seat. We got a bag of popcorn and the young lady at concessions was very friendly and sweet. Great first impression. We went to our theater and the young man checking tickets was very friendly as well. So far so good! The theater was nice and the seats that reclined was a very big perk. We had a blast! We will come back for sure and bring the kiddo next time for the bowling and arcade.

Only down fall was that alcohol wasn't allowed in the theater area. I was a bit disappointed by this as it was would be very nice to drink a glass of wine on girls night and laugh at the movie."
Positive	"I've found capriottis Bobbie's father here at eddy d's. It's called the Robert. You know an Italian spot is good if you see Italians eating there.
I've been here twice and so far my favorite is the Elliott Ness. Anything with fries in it, calls my name. They have so much more to choose from.

I've only tried their meatballs in one of the sandwiches. I suppose they're known for their meatballs. But even in the sandwich, you can taste all the herbs mixed in this savory ball of meat!

The service is soo family style. We saw this lady walk in. We thought cool another italian customer. Then she started bringing our sandwiches over. Her name is Shirley and she's absolutely a sweetheart! She straight took care of us. Which made the experience above awesome."
Positive	I started yoga 4 months ago at the Dahn studio on Windmill and it has had such a positive impact on my life. The masters are so helpful and caring, they want to help you succeed. I am forever grateful to the person who put the pamphlet on my front door, it has changed my life for the better.
Positive	"Best buffet ever!  I told my friends about their amazing brunch, which I had a few years back.  Well, missed out on breakfast, but I knew we wouldn't be disappointed with their lunch.  We were there for 3.5hrs!  I got the bottomless mimosas so I definitely took advantage!

I was also there for 3.5 hours when I went their for brunch.  It was a few years back, and I drank just as much, if not more, then.. so I can't remember all the details.  But what I did remember made me come back.

Speaking of which, I hardly saw the bottom of my glass.  Every time I came back, there was a new glass regardless of how much was left in the other.  I love this place, and will try to make it for breakfast next time."
Positive	Awesome customer service Devon is very helpful and kind,lots of good reviews from other customers,I just moved here from cali so I wias looking for a honest place ,,think I found it!!
Positive	My bf and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was busy but not packed. We were seated immediately in the sushi section. Our waitress greeted us promptly and asked for our drink order. We decide on the house flavored sake - white peach. We placed our nigiri order and sat for a few minutes. Our sake came soon and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend the flavored sake they make. Our nigiri orders started coming to the table in about 10 min. The food was all very fresh. I love that they don't smother the fish with a ton of rice. The presentation of the food was pretty typical for sushi. The ambiance of the restaurant is family friendly with half the restaurant having hibachi. The service was wonderful. We had the wait staff stopping and making sure we were doing alright and if we wanted to place any more orders. Overall, very happy with my visit. The food was great and the service was wonderful. Will definitely be coming back again.
Positive	Fabulous experience! The service was wonderful, Monica is amazing. The chicken nachos, absolutely amazing! The chicken is blackened and there are two pounds (literally) on them. Every chip is covered with toppings, and the serving size is really huge! Excellent experience!
Positive	5 stars for all of their breads.  I particularly like the raisin walnut and new york rye for freezing and toasting (though all their breads freeze well, don't be afraid to get yourself a big loaf).  I wish they could slice half a loaf for me (half for now, half sliced/frozen for later), but I can deal.  I've had better pastries, and their chocolate croissants are denser than I'd like, but they're still the best in the area.  They close at 3 on Saturdays, but Tuesday-Friday they stay open until 6pm.  Layout is awkward for larger crowds, so do NOT go on Saturday morning if you're in a hurry, there'll be a line out the door.  Also be advised that the selection is pretty limited in the afternoon, so if you want something specific, best to get there in the morning.
Positive	Amelies.  Love it.  Great food and the staff is wonderful.  Their cakes are a little expensive.  I wanted to get one to feed 20 people and it was over $100.  Other than that, I really like the place.
Positive	"This is my go to bar.  Always bringing lots of friends,  and always having fun. Everyone is really awesome and friendly. 
The drinks are the best. I mean come on slushie alcohol! !!!!!! You gotta try it out! !!"
Positive	First time eating at Poukei and i'am obsessed. It's very good healthy food. The personnel were really nice and it's was conveniently located next to  the Zappos Theater. Will definitely come back.
Positive	Great place!  A truly wonderful dining experience each time.  This place is a great example of a restauranteur who understands and is comfortable with their concept.  Kabob Je offers great authentic food true to its ethnic menu  while being approachable to anyone.  Relaxed service from a young but competent staff,  and great open kitchen and moderate pricing.  They keep it simple, consistent and interesting using daily specials.  Do yourself the favor and grab a meal here.
Positive	The food is great!  The place looks great as well, it's very clean and organized.  The only thing I might mention is that the service feels rushed, as if they're trying to get the line shorter by confusing everyone by asking what we want before it's actually our turn to order.  Often times I must repeat myself a few times before they get what I want, which is frustrating.  However, like I said before, the food definitely makes up for it!
Positive	This place is newly opened and I was excited to try it as I've been going to the sheppard location religiously. I got their opening special which consists of 1 whole chicken fried and covered in one of their signature flavours + 1 pitcher of beer for $40. This place is by far better than the sheppard location and probably the best Korean fried chicken in the city, and I've tried them all so that's saying something. They also have cute waitresses so that's always a plus! Highly recommend their Gold Cheese flavour. Generous cheese toppings and gold cheese seasoning is SO DAMN GOOD.
Positive	"The most legit Korean food. I am so in love with these dishes that it's dangerous. The food court looks sketch but when you peek into her kitchen you'll see the family actually cooking your food. It takes a min to cook but to me, that's a good sign coz it's fresh.  

The only dishes that make me think of my Grandma! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
Positive	I have been going to Laura Beth for a long time. She is an amazing stylist. I have naturally curly hair and it's hard to work with. She cuts it to perfection and I can style it easily. I always get compliments on the color she does. I went from a mousey brown to a fantastic blonde. She has never left me brassy or discolored. I would recommend her to anyone
Positive	I would give fuddruckers 4 stars, but the service at this one is outstanding! Adrian was informative and super friendly, accommodating, and honest. The Guy grilling the burgers did a great job and was also freindly and engaging. Even the dude that wiped our table was super nice.
Positive	"the 24/7 $5 blackjack tables are money (pun intended).

for a nice hotel, that is so rare! I didnt stay here, but ill def come back to play :)

I also love the chihuly display in the ceiling"
Positive	"Mcadams Dental certainly lives up to the hype! The office was clean, the staff was friendly, and Dr. McAdams was extremely nice. He made me feel comfortable and at ease. Which was no simple task, knowing I needed to have a tooth extracted due to a very painful infection. 

He made sure that felt little to no pain. He explained every step of what he was doing. And before I knew it. The tooth was out. 

It was affordable for someone with no dental insurance. They were very accommodating in that regard. 

If you're looking for the best dental experience in the valley. Definitely choose McAdams Dental!"
Positive	Figured this place could use a recent review as the last were almost a year ago. I have only been to Roberto's a few times and this was my first time visiting this particular one. We just moved in not too far away and decided to stop in on the way home from a night out. This is definitely not the most glamorous place but the guy at the register was kind and outgoing and I liked that you can see into the kitchen and watch everything that goes on. It was after 1am I believe and its one of the better non-fast food options. The breakfast burrito was huge (I actually wish they had a smaller option) and a bit heavy for a late night meal... however it was very tasty. I'm sure I'll be back now that it is so close. I always see a bunch of people there when I drive by so this location must do fairly well despite the negative reviews. Hopefully my experiences stay positive moving forward!
Positive	The friendliest store in our neighborhood! Great customer service and a one stop shop for all your computer, printing and mailing needs. Thank you for providing such a great service to us that makes us this place our favorite! No need to drive far, come to this store and you won't get disappointed.
Positive	"Very authentic!

What I mean is, authentic enough that if you don't know some spanish you're going to have a very hard time ordering here. This is the only place my family goes for mexican meat or baked goods. 

Seriously, walking into this store is like taking a little trip to Mexico itself.

A little scary at first, but totally worth it."
Positive	The Habit Burger competes with In and Out Burger and they are doing so extremely well. My husband is very picky about his burgers and he gave HB 2 thumbs up. The young lady who helped us was so great! Thank you!! I will be back soon Monica!
Positive	"We decided to try their dinner buffet tonight but it turns out the buffet is only for lunch now.  We were a bit disappointed.  The waitress started bringing out the menus and they had a reasonable Chinese dinner for 6 for $108.  The restaurant was fine with us switching the method for making a couple of dishes and that was the fried shrimp rice (we wanted the basmati rice instead of the Chinese rice - we know they have Indian food during their lunch buffet) and also the chicken dish was a deep-fried chicken and we switched to the cold wine chicken with ginger/garlic oily sauce.  You already know the 2 dishes that came with the dinner for 6 and the other dishes were fish maw soup, lobster in a cream sauce, Chinese broccoli with straw mushrooms, celery, sugar peas and carrots with shrimp and squid, steamed tilapia fish with ginger and spring onions and a Bo-Bo Cha-Cha hot dessert soup.

We thoroughly enjoyed all the food presented to us tonight.  Everything was freshly made and so delicious.  The greens were so green and tender, the seafood so fresh, the chicken so delicious, the fried basmati shrimp rice just right, one word: Perfect!  

We've found our Shangri-La!  Will be back for more dinners.  The chef here is so good at what he does!"
Positive	"Bonnie P recommended that I check this place out, and I am glad I did!

My dogs have always eaten Science Diet, but they don't offer this item - the selection is more of the higher priced, grain free and protein based food.  I decided to give ""Taste of the Wild"" a try. After deciding on a small bag and heading to the check out, the cashier asked what kind of dog I had. Once she found out, she recommended I try the Salmon version of that food, because the Bison might be too much protein. I really appreciat that they care and aren't just there to upsell everything.

I signed up for the rewards, which keeps track of how much you buy and gives you a discount after you reach a certain total.

There are tons of leashes, crates, collars, treats, bones galore. If you have a pet, definitely stop in and check it out.  They are dog friendly too!"
Positive	I stopped in at Meineke with my Pontiac vibe to have it checked out before I took off to Salt Lake today. Justin was very helpful, the oil change only took 20 minutes, and he advised me of a few services I'd likely need after my trip. I'll be back to see him next week. Thanks Meineke!
Positive	"I've been going here for about four years now. Not a very thorough review of the place since I usually order the same things every now and then. I can say that the deep fried tofu is a little on the dry side. I prefer deep fried tofu done like at an all you can eat Japanese restaurant, but this isn't one.

I usually order the Hong Kong-style ice lemon tea along with the crispy chicken over fried rice with Portuguese sauce topped with a fried egg. It's a great dish that I always seem to default to. 

Their curry fish balls are standard, but nonetheless they're one of my favorites.

I've also had their chicken fried rice several times, I've been pleased with that dish as well.

I'll definitely be returning here again.

I've been told there's another Kenny's restaurant on Steeles but I've yet to try it. If it's anything as good as this one, then I'll surely check it out in the future."
Positive	"Tried this a few weeks ago and ever since had a hankering to get back for more. Only problem is their stupid hours... Who closes at 7PM on the weekdays, 2PM on saturday, and isn't open on Sunday? Guess when you're sitting on a gold mine you can do what you want...

Burgers are big and sloppy and awesome. That's really all there is to say. Decor is kinda cool, I posted pics if you want to see some. 

Food is cheap and fast, a big plus. Its right off the Thomas and Central Lite Rail stop, so if you're looking for good eats, Lenny's is a good stop! Only problem is the hours, but hell if I was old Lenny, I'd need some time for golf too."
Positive	This location is on The Strip so I am going to assume that it is busy most nights and they are prepared for it. From my experience this place was a fine oiled machine! The wait was more than acceptable compared to the hour long waits other restaurants quoted us. We were seated in a booth by the kitchen and I enjoyed watching the line of runners walking out with plates of food. It was my type of runway, less heals more food! The food was good, burgers, sandwiches and fries were all cooked well and quite tasty. And our server, Pricilla I believe her name was, was beyond great! She was attentive even though she had a number of tables to attend to and when carding my boyfriend noticed that we were in town celebrating his birthday and had a surprise treat for him at the end of our meal. All and all it was a good dinning experience and a safe haven from the madness that is The Strip.
Positive	Mickey is the man! I have been looking for a decent barber in the area and I think I have found the guy. Cut my hair exactly how I wanted, knew what he was doing, and a good guy to talk with. Look forward to being a regular! Thanks Mickey!
Positive	Kayagum is a little pricey compared to other Korean restaurants in the area but it offers variety of options and the quality is pretty good. It is usually packed on friday and saturday dinner time but the wait is never too terrible. Getting the bill is a bit of an hassle because you have to ring the bell a couple times but now I learned and go straight to the cashier at the front. Overall, satisfied every time and the convenient location is a bonus.
Positive	Currently the best taco place I have been to! You need to try their shrimp taco, the sauce is amazing. Definitely worth the visit however, keep in mind that seating is very limited (bench for 4 ppl and other standing area). $5 for a taco, best tacos in Toronto so far!
Positive	"If you are a fan of Korean food, then Jin Mee is a definite must!  On top of having some tasty dishes, this place also understands the meaning of customer service.  If you have yet to try this place... I highly recommend it!  5 Stars all the way!  

Pros:

  * Charcoal & Gas Grill Tables available
 
     I haven't been to all the Korean restaurants in town, but this is the first (that I've encountered) where I had a choice.  Since most restaurants are Gas Grills, I just had to try the Charcoal... I loved it!  It gives the meat a smoky / charred taste.  I personally think it tastes 10 times better this way.


  * Budae Jiigae

      After experiencing this soup at Soya, I've been obsessed with it.  They actually didn't have it on the menu, but was more than happy to accommodate our request.  I'd seriously come back here just for this... it was so amazing and the best I've ever had!


  * Atmosphere / Service

      As I mentioned earlier, Jin Mee has some stellar service.  It's not often I can go to a restaurant and request a dish that is not on the menu.  The atmosphere was just as amazing.  Seating was plentiful and spacious.  There is even a Karaoke bar for those future idols.

Cons:

   * Location

        This is just a personal con for me.  The drive is out of my way, but I'd definitely come back.  For those interested, it is located inside Commercial Center off of Sahara (East of the Las Vegas Blvd).


Tips:

*  Ask to sit at the Charcoal Grill.  You can really taste the difference.  I'm sure after you try the Charcoal, you won't want to do the Gas Grill ever again.

*  Karaoke room available!  This place is huge and has the capacity to cater a party if need be.  If you are looking for a place to have dinner and then have drinks and sing karaoke after, this just may be the perfect place.

*  If you cannot read Korean, this place may be hard to spot initially.  Once you are inside commercial center, it is the restaurant that faces East and has a huge Scrolling Text sign.


Overall:

  Everything I tried here was just amazing.  I have nothing, but compliments when it comes to the taste and quality of the food.  Ever since I went here, I've been telling all my other friends about it.  I'll be back soon for sure... real soon!"
Positive	"Came here with my company during an event we held at the nearby Ravella. We liked it so much that we came back twice in the 5 days we were there. 

First of all, our waiter was very nice and very helpful, suggesting items on the menu that ended up being great. 

I had the Chicken Parmigiana and it. was. delicious. In fact, I had a hard time choosing anything else after having that the next time we went. Now that I think of it, I don't think I did lol. 

If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely come back to this place."
Positive	We absolutely love the sizzling rice soup, and have had it multiple times since we first found Tottie's about a month ago.  We typically get it to go, but also had a good sit down experience last week. The restaurant is beautiful and our waitress was very friendly.  Our soup was superb as usual, though we weren't overly impressed with our sushi choices.  Either way, we'll definitely go back!
Positive	"I had the Thai coconut chicken salad with the dressing on the side   Ordered the half ended up with the full   No complaints as I think you need to full size for a meal. It was seriously yummy. 

The salad is a very moist  so I would strongly recommend that the dressing is on the side.  

The BLT  was fresh with a good combination of flavours.  The slaw on the side needed something, really added nothing to the plate"
Positive	Great special dollar tacos on a Thursday!  Tacos were filled nicely, no skimping here!  Drinks reasonably priced!  Very close to home.  Three of us, we ordered basket of fries, a total of 7 tacos, 2 big beers and a jack/ coke, $23..... can't beat it!
Positive	Went in last weekend with the intention of trading in my Jeep for a Touring and ended up leaving with 2 trade-ins and 2 new vehicles (Touring and Tacoma). I have to say I will never go to another dealership again! David Wilson's team were wonderful to work with and they made the process fast, efficient and painless. Thanks again...
Positive	This airport doesn't have anything open late at night so if you fly late, better stick to the routine, don't eat past certain time. However, if you like to munch on something then try to get something before coming here. Clean airport. Not a lot of walking to the gate. iPhone chargers are enough to cover a few people at a time. A lot of seats by the gate for all passengers. To get to the rental car is a pain because the bus will take you to the rental car center. That's not all but that center doesn't have all the car rentals situated there. So for some people who order the car from certain companies such as Ace or Sixth, you have to go from one bus to another shuttle to get to the rental car. Not a lot of fun there.
Positive	Back at coffee bean.  Yea Aleita is still manager.  I love my iced tea lemonade & Anthony is making do with water.  It is actually very nice in the patio.
Positive	"I don't know what people's problem is, because I loved my dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. A steak dinner on the strip, with a great view and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for? Ok sure, the steak could be thicker, but it's perfectly cooked with delicious sauce and a huge side of perfectly thin, crispy frites! Plus you can easily upgrade to a filet for a few dollars more. I was torn between having the french onion soup or the macaroni gratin on the side but I quickly decided on the macaroni. Boy was I glad I did! The side is plenty for 2 to share and sooo delicious! Plenty of creamy cheese sauce and crunchy breadcrumbs with parmesan! YUM! They have a nice list of wines by the glass, I went with a spicy Cote-du-Rhone that complemented the steak perfectly.
Personally, I think it's pretty hilarious that people are concerned that this is a tourist trap. I mean, HELLO! it's on the strip! Isn't this whole street the glaring, glittering, bare-assed definition of a tourist trap? Given everything surrounding it I think that this place is a gem and an exception to the  Vegas rule of being over-the-top expensive and more glitz than substance."
Positive	I'm only getting to this now but before Christmas my daughter locked us out of the house and  I received very fast service and I would recommend them to anyone. Thanks 3 Rivers
Positive	I came in to purchase my grandmother a bracelet and charms for Mother's Day. I came the day before the holiday and expected it to be packed, but to my surprise it was packed, but I was serviced w/out a wait. The sales associate was VERY helpful & friendly, which you don't get at these Pandora chains. (Unfortunately) I purchased her a bracelet, and 3 charms. I received a free bangle w/my purchase. I was pleased! Great experience here.
Positive	Solid! Ate here twice in a weekend. My favorite item was the tofu bao, although the kimchi fries were pretty great too. I also got a lemongrass tofu sandwich and it was very tasty.
Positive	"Far exceeded my expectations for the price and a wonderful experience that I would easily recommend if you want to enjoy 5 hours for the locals price of $20 for a spa.  

There are 3 sauna rooms upstairs, including a movie theatre that are co-ed if you miss your significant other or opposite sex friend.  

The spicy ramen soup which included kimchi for $10 was a bargain.  

You may want to bring a book or magazine, unless you want to watch subtitled Korean soaps.  You don't need to bring anything because towel, clothes, and robe are provided"
Positive	Been coming here for years. Good food. I always order off of the food truck menu now which always  has a few different things. Nice to meet here for dates or a quick bite to eat.
Positive	Just what we needed in downtown!  Casual, family-friendly & delicious!  We're going back for the Sunday brunch & $4 unlimited French toast. Really enjoyed the openness and overall vibe of this place.
Positive	"Pho Kim Long, your pho is pho king good!  

After a night of partying, we were tired, hungry and hungover.  When we got dropped off by our cab, we were dreading the wait as there were tons of people already in line.  Thank goodness we didn't wait longer than 20 minutes and as soon as we ordered our food appeared magically fast.

Perfect hangover cure with your delicious broth and flawlessly cooked noodles.  The broth is full of flavor- hot, salty, yet sweet from all the onions & cilantro in the soup. Even best is that the rare beef isn't chewy but tender and I'm able to actually eat it without feeling like it's going to choke me on the way down.  Trust me, a lot of Vietnamese Pho places rare beef is so chewy you can't eat it.  

I just got back from LV and I am already in need of pho from here.  Pho Kim Long has one of the most flavorful pho's I have ever had.  

BTW...what's with these names at these Vietnamese restaurants?  Pho King Funny!  Pun intented."
Positive	Au Kouign-Amann has quality baked goods. I order a variety of different pastries. My only complaint was that the almond maple tart was a little hard. The customer service was decent and I enjoyed their sense of humor. I would definitely come back again.
Positive	"I don't know where to start!! GREAT SERVICE and I have to say thank you to SHANNON...!! She is the most professional, hard working and kind, Customer service representative I have ever met!! 

I highly recommend Bell Lexus to everyone!  

Thank you soooooooooo much!!!!!


Jon"
Positive	Wowsers!! This place was beyond what I'd ever imagine..The SNAKE RIVER FARMS NEW YORK STRIP (yes in all caps kind of good) was beyond words. It was so tender, juicy, succulent, any word that would describe pure bliss please add it to this review!!! The atmosphere mixed with the people at my table..Along with Bond our waiter..It was the dopest night ever! If you go ask for Bond he was amazing! Oh and Abstinthe..Have to try it, the green elixir!
Positive	After 1st seeing Pepero and Grand Asian Market, I was a bit down. BUT, it's a whole different story with Super G Mart. Reminds me of NJ's HMart but a little bigger however not necessarily more stocked. Even tho Super G Mart is a Korean market, it has international items. Can't believe they even HV blue fish! YUM! I was so happy to find and explore Super G that haha I took so many pics.
Positive	"Such a great experience this was. We shared some ahi tuna, vegas rolls, garlic snap peas, and had fried ice cream for dessert. 

The Sushi was made perfectly! 

One thing I would say about their green ice tea... DON'T GET IT!! It seriously tastes like someone took a diaper and rung it out in the tea. 

The Garlic snap peas are my new favorite thing. Fried ice cream was amazing, it has a touch of cinnamon, which made it that much better!! I 'm craving more of it. 

RA Sushi.... I will be back for more!"
Positive	"Jesus Canadians are nice. Come here for an iced coffee to help beat the heat and the people that work here are the nicest people I've ever met. It could be they are Canadian and it's in their nature and being from NY I just expect everyone to be an asshole but I don't think that's it. 

I Love Toronto!"
Positive	My first time visiting Sabor today and all I can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy! My kids loved this perfect little addition to Davidson as well and I can definitely see us becoming regulars.
Positive	"Unexpected, wonderful buffet food. 

We came here on a two for one coupon we received on the airplane with light expectations and were blown away. This buffet is not just full of comfort food, rather, probably 40 percent of it is actually something interesting and exploratory to try!

Don't leave without eating the beef marrow bones, beef bourgeoise, half the desserts, the whole roast pig. 

For comparison, last night we ate at the buffet at Caesars. That was great, don't get me wrong, but we waited in line 90m, and there was line for food. There was more seafood there, but less that we had never had. It was classics done to perfection there rather than taking chances.

Take the chance and go to wicked spoon!!!"
Positive	"Old School is a chic brunch and dinner spot on Dundas West. From cool graphics on their chalk board-styled wall to the large windows, Old School invites couples and small families alike to dine at this spacious restaurant.

I ordered their Chicken and Waffles, which was a bit more pricey than what I would usually pay at $18, but I was craving some at the time. The dish wasn't so bad, but I think at that price point, it definitely should have been much more memorable. I also got to sample their popular Blueberry Hill Pancakes from my friend's plate and I definitely recommend it for anyone who plans on having brunch here! So the food can be good, depending on the dish you order.

I love the atmosphere of Old School, especially during the day. It's a lovely restaurant to have a day date at or hang out with friends for a relaxed environment. The space has a very Instagrammable aesthetic, so you can definitely get a cool pic here or two!"
Positive	"Yay for efficient service!

Purchased two items online, but had to return them.
When I called their toll-free number, I was told that some items have a 14 day return policy, whereas other items have a 30 day policy.  

Service over the general Best Buy line was okay/good.  Service in person...  was soo good.
Lillian? made the return pain-free, which is great since we had a couple of errands to run that night.  The line-up on the Friday night, wasn't bad at all.  Factor in two customer care representatives, and it was no time before our turn was up.

The rep on the phone cautioned me for a worse-case scenario, that maybe we'll be hassled to return an item since it was literally at 15 days.

No such thing happened in person.  
My electronic device was still sealed in the Canada Post bubble pack.  They had to open it there.  The return, could not have been more smooth.

I only wish they were located closer to home.  Nonetheless, a positive shopping/return experience means that I'll definitely be interested in shopping with Best Buy again.  Not to mention that their deal beat the other ones that I compared their prices and value to."
Positive	"Amazing food, great ambiance and impeccable service! Thank you Miroslav for making our experience absolutely delightful. The seafood, fillet, wine & desserts were all fabulous. 

We ordered the fillet on the bone prepared medium, it was like cutting into butter. Seabass was cooked perfectly and dusted with light bread crumbs. Whipped mash potato were soft and full of buttery flavor. Mac n cheese topped off with shrimp and crab?? The noodles cooked to the perfect temperature and tossed into a number of cheeses along with seasonings. Topped off with crab and shrimp. Must try!! It was heaven in my mouth!"
Positive	"We really enjoyed this place. I've now been twice: once as a couple and once as a family. 

The service was excellent both times and we had a great time. 

Not sure if the concept is for everyone, after all, the food is boiled in a bag, but we liked it. It's SUPER messy and they used disposable plastic cutlery and gloves so be prepared with clothes you may be prepared to stain!

It's a bit pricey but the portions are generous and we left full and happy. Nice addition to for unique restaurant choices in Newmarket.

All in all, worth a try!"
Positive	"I took my 6 month old shih tzu, Poppins, to Bargain Barks and am 100% satisfied with their efficiency, facility AND hair cut of our little girl.  The groomer asked questions on what I was looking for and followed my instructions exactly.
I was called promptly when she was almost ready.  There are no kennel/cages and she had a little play area while waiting for me.
Since I am dogsitting for a friend, I asked if Lolly could be squeezed in for a bath.  They complied.  The girls and I am very happy and have found a new groomer!
Heads Up: they accept cash only.  With the $35 cost, stopping at the bank first was well worth it."
Positive	"I love this place!  The wait staff is excellent.  Friendly and very attentive even though it gets crazy busy.  The portions are ridiculous and unlike other places that replace quantity for quality, this place has both.  With all the options available in Vegas, this has made my rotation is which is high praise for me.

The best value here is the kids menu...one kid's plate could probably feed like 3-4 kids easily"
Positive	We went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I had the boneless wings (medium) which were really good!  My husband had the pastrami sandwich and that was excellent as well.  I liked that the place had a family friendly atmosphere.
Positive	I am so impressed with how the managers, specifically Sarah (glasses and pregnant), go out of their way. Incredibly helpful to me and really went above and beyond. This location is farther but prefer to come to this one for the customer service!
Positive	I believe his name was lemont. But these guys were great. They left the car really clean and smelling good. Will definitely be back to get our car clean. THANKS GUYS!
Positive	Their pizza is a nice change from some of the other traditional places out there not saying it's the greatest but it's decent for what it is. High quality toppings and delicious crust. Good fast service from this location will order again from them real soon
Positive	This place is great.  Just off of Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale.  Good food, great prices and very helpful employees.  They deliver if you are in the area.
Positive	If you ever want to feel like you're in the right place, just take one step into Power in Motion. With Devin's energy and expertise, it's easy to see why this place is on the rise in the North Scottsdale area. Devin couldn't be a more professional trainer with the skills to make anyone reach their goals. Everyone needs to know about this place!
Positive	"Location: it is located on Mill avenue where everything is happening. There are only 2 tables inside the place. If u have a huge party with you, it might be tough to hang out in there. If u just want to make a quick shop for some delicious ice-cream, this is definitely the place to go. 

Service: the lady who works behind the counter was friendly. I definitely feel bad for her giving us ice-cream and working as a cashier at the same time. Nevertheless, she still has a very positive attitude at work. 

Food: their mint and cookie ice-cream is delicious!!!! 

Rating: I'll definitely come back here again. Good location. Good food."
Positive	Maybe I'm spoiled, but I expected more.   Our waiter was truly delightful.  Maybe one of the best I've had.  Charming, engaging and attentive.   Our bus boys were also quite good.  The sommelier however has a wee bit of attitude and had to be searched out more than once if we wanted a top off.   And even though we didn't spent 1000 on a bottle of wine, I think their bottle prices still demand a bit of attention.   But if you don't want to be attentive then leave it table side.  You know?    The ambiance was also lovely.   The setting changes made me a bit dizzy and I did wonder if the amount of water this place went through washing dishes was the reason lake Mead is so low  watching the fountains was an added bonus but be forewarned when the explosives go off a few of us were shot out of our seats.    Now to the food.   The appetizers were lovely and delicious.   I might not have put the chip under the scallop as that made the bottom of it mushy.  On the other hand the toasted brioche should have been under the foie gras to have time to soak up some of the lovely grease and juice.   The flavor of both was still great though and the foie gras was perfectly cooked.   The added price for the iberico ham (on special) was worth it.   The lamb however was not a hit.   Super tender, but over salted.   And then in contrast the roasted root vegetables with it had no flavor and were a bit pasty. A little garlic even would have helped?  The chocolate fondant dessert was back to five star, just way too much after all the previous courses and disappointing not to finish.  And then they brought us cookies or petit fours which the waiter quite kindly boxed up.  Haven't tried any of the other supposedly good French restaurants around. Be forewarned it's not a place for light eaters, and even if you are ravenous it's still a lot.  This ones nice for an elegant special night out.  It was good, but I honestly expected a little better from a Michelin two star.
Positive	Amazing!! Service was awesome and food is delicious. You have to try the chocolate cake. It is the moistest cake I have ever had. Well worth the price by far.. Will definitely be back soon.
Positive	What a great Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area!  We enjoyed a nice lunch outside by the pond on Saturday.  The enchiladas and the carne asada burro was delicious.  The service was good, the place was huge and felt authentic - we'll be back if we're in the Carefree area again!
Positive	"2 words.  Pastor Volcan.  Every time, all the time.

Location is great as well since six pack & ARC are right down the street, so it becomes a great post-workout meal.

Chips are included, salsa is included if you're eating in (one is a a generic mild tomato salsa, the other a spicier orange salsa... I want to say habanero-based but it's not quite as spicy as habanero would be.

But really, get that pastor volcan.  It will blow your mind for under $3."
Positive	I was a long term client of John's, and my experience with him was terrific. John is an amazing listener, and offers realistic and sound advice. John offers assistance with any subject you would like to discuss, and gives honest and open feedback about what steps need to be taken to achieve your goals. Instead of focusing on the past, or why things are how they are; John will focus on the now, help direct you on things that can be done today, and challenge you to become the best person that you can be. If you are in the market for a life coach, John is your guy.
Positive	What a great experience had at this dealer. Was shopping for a large enough trailer to accommodate having lots of company and kids. Every team member was happy and eager to help us. Kevin was my representative and what a great job he did. Not only did he show us exactly what we were looking for but he even showed us some of the huge model A class motor homes that obviously we would not be buying. Had lots of fun and can't wait to continue doing business in the future.
Positive	"Their espresso is perfectly made; As such, their Americano is absolute perfection. 

This third-wave coffee shop always makes my evenings with my wife very special. There is something about the coffee and ambiance here that makes the conversations ever-so deep.

Perfection; Absolute perfection. May this place remain perfect and exist as such forever across time and space.

If I lived near this coffee shop, I would visit it many times a week."
Positive	Tire mart is the best!!!!!! I came in with a huge nail in my tire and they had me in and out in no time. I recommend them before anyone else and I'll definitely be back. Ask for jean!!
Positive	I hope maybe my visit was a sign that this place is turning around a bit. I went to Barrio in the airport on the way to NYC a couple weeks ago. I had the burrito with chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of yummyness inside. I thought it was very good! Very close to the quality of the food at their original restaurant. The service was a bit slow for an airport place, but that means you have to get there a bit earlier. The BF had the pulled pork torta and really enjoyed his food as well. I would say the cons include: expensive, not enough space between tables for a place in an airport...need a little space for luggage etc, and the service is slower than fast casual places (obviously). The pros, however, include: The food is very tasty, the ingredients in my food tasted fresh, they have tasty margaritas, and you're in the airport and not eating at pizza hut.....Hopefully the kinks will get worked out at this location and it can be just as successful as the location on 16th st.
Positive	Tried their Apple Fritters, Cinnamon buns, Pinecones, Lemon powdered Bismarks and regular glazed donuts. All very good. The bismark and the donuts were very soft and airy when I ordered them, not to mention a little warm! For larger orders I recommend the apple fritters or pinecones over the cinnamon buns, just because the cinnamon bun gets stale quicker. If you are looking for a little excitement the pinecone also has more texture than the apple fritters.
Positive	"I mostly love this place. The screens are great, the seats are comfortable, and I like that they occasionally show independent fare. The prices are steep, but it's worth it to get the Movie Watcher card, which lowers the ticket price by a couple of dollars. The $6 weekend morning price is  very good deal, so take advantage of it when you can.

If this is your first time visiting, come a little early in case you have trouble finding your theater (the layout can be confusing). Also be aware that outside food and beverages are not allowed, and they'll take you for all you're worth at concession. So don't bother with the food there, eat before you arrive."
Positive	This company is awesome. They came out and cleaned my carpeting and my tile floors. I thought there was absolutely no hope for the tile, but it came out incredible. The tech who came out was hard working, honest, and a pleasure to deal with. Thank you so much for a quality and professional job in a climate where that is sometimes hard to come by.
Positive	Don't let the window paint or a hop, skip ans jump drive to Cave Creek scare you off. This isn't a fly by night place. The white table linens inside set the stage for a elegant, memorable meal.  And let me just tell you, don't leave the building without trying the brat sliders! The wine list is supple. The staff is friendly. Humble, cozy place. The band on a Saturday night, a nice touch. A little loud, but made for something different.  And the menu was different. A little bit of Italian, Greek and German. I wanted for more options but apparently an expanded menu is in the works. And we cannot breakfast Wow! Still, the Cuban sandwich and just my size skinny fries were off the chart! Overall, a surprisingly good, worldly, experience. We are eager to go back and bring friends.
Positive	"Gluten free? Not a beer drinker? Love beer but exploring other options? 
Whatever your reason, give it a shot, or a pint.
I love going here and grabbing their chess set and playing a few games. Call me a nerd, but I love the chill atmosphere and digging into their games. The cider is pretty great, too. I have yet to get a pint, I always wind up with a flight (why have one when you can have them all?)"
Positive	"Tried out D box for the first time at this theatre and I have to say...quite a fantastic experience!
I will admit that it has to be a movie where you can appreciate movements in fast paced scenes and those with a lot of action. Furious 7 was a great way to appreciate this and the seat did not disappoint
I also liked the fact that you could tailor the intensity according to how much you can handle, which does give you more control over the experience...although let's face it-I went for MAX!
There is a cup holder for your drink as well so don't worry too much about spills. I would think twice before buying a saucy hot dog for the duration of the movie.
At 19.99 it is definitely on the more expensive side, but a great way to use 1000 scene points!"
Positive	"There's nothing better on this earth, than a Lil' Nicky's iced latte on a sunny afternoon during an extended lunch break from work. Truly nothing.

Lil' Nicky's has earned a special place in my heart, one iced latte at a time. If you're one of the unfortunate souls on this earth who has not yet had a chance to visit Lil' Nicky's, I feel extremely sorry for you.

Wherever you are right at this moment, you need to drop what you're doing, get on your bike, or in your car, or on a bus and make your way as fast as possible to Lil' Nicky's. There is no time to waste.

Whether it's the expert way they blend the milk with the coffee, or the special measuring tools they use to concoct the drink, there is nothing quite like it. I do believe angels fly down from heaven and sprinkle some angel dust in each cup as well.

It has been said ""Little Nicky"" was a Greek god."
Positive	Couldnt figure out why my tahoe wasnt running properly. Been to other shops, they couldnt figure it out. Zach the owner looked at my car immediatly and figured it out within 20 mins! One bad spark plug!! mind you i recently did a tune up! He's quick, trustworthy and doesnt give you the run around. BTW He specializes in diagnostics and A/C.
Positive	"Excellent middle eastern food in a pretty sketchy, run-down location. 

Almost a little too authentic for me. I though I was a big Baba Ghanoush fan until I ate here the other day. It was pretty weird consistency and had a very pungent flavor. I'm guessing this is how it supposed to be made. I'm not sure if I'm a Baba Ghanoush man anymore.

I had a vegetarian plate, which was very diverse, large, and tasty. I think it ran 8.50 and came with hummus, the aforementioned pungent baba ghanoush, dolmades, falafel, tabouli, spanakopita, pita bread, and soup or salad (I got the lentil soup). Everything was very flavorful and delicious, except for the dolmades which were surprisingly tame. The falafel which was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm, tasty, and chewy on the inside was a welcome change from the pedestrian falafel I've had recently at the big fat greek and cyprus pita grill.

My companion got the Arabic alliance certified mixed kebab platter. It looked awesome, but didn't blow my friend's mind. It had baba ghanoush, hummus, rice, a chicken kabob, and a beef kabob as well as pita and soup/salad. 

The biggest issue with this place is its location. Seedy, old strip mall trying to class it up with a whole foods market, arab market, fattoush, etc. But that area is not the kind of place to walk around at night and the dining room at fattoush isn't much to look at. It's the kind of place you want to eat at and get out of as soon as possible. Hopefully in due time they will be able to move to a better location.

Although the staff is very friendly, seemed to be on a first name basis with most of the people who came in, and of course makes great food. I'd recommend it for lunch or take out when you are looking for a big, flavorful meal."
Positive	"We were going to eat at one of the high rated sushi restaurants up the street, but the wait for 5 plus a baby was over an hour on a Sunday night at 7:00.  We passed by Akita on our way, and saw the ""all you can eat"", so we decided to try there.  We were seated immediately, and our food came out just as quick.  We are from Southern Cal and really expected excellent sushi, and WE GOT IT.  The rolls were very flavorful and varied.  Definitely worth the price, and all of it was really fresh, even as it was towards closing.  Would recommend this place to all!"
Positive	Kim is amazing.  I have been going to her for several years now after a series of unfortunate haircuts at other salons.  My hair is finally where I want it to be!  I highly recommend Kim!
Positive	"** Walk Through Review **

I don't know why, but I always kind of associate Las Vegas and Caesars Palace. Maybe it is pop culture or whatever, but the two are linked in my head. Although I didn't stay at Caesars, one thing I had planned to do was to walk through the Casino. 

I love the Roman theme and the hotel fully embraces it. There are fountains, columns, and statues everywhere. Walking into the shops area is really cool because the ceiling is painted like the sky and it feels like you are walking down a Roman street. The shopping area was huge and contained just about every high-end retailer you could imagine. 

The Casino area was huge and had all the games you would expect to see. There were bars and restaurants everywhere.

I can't give a rating on the hotel rooms or anything like that, but just as an attraction to see while in Las Vegas, Caesars is one not to miss!"
Positive	Love coming here for brunch. When the weather is nice, I love to come here and sit in the patio. Everything on the brunch menu is $10 and it comes with a beer or a mimosa...can't beat that deal! My favorite dishes are the green chili breakfast burrito or the churrasco steak & egg. I used to always get their breakfast flatbread but they changed their flatbread few months ago to this much thicker cracker crust that my friends and I are not a fan of...please bring back the old flatbread crust!...it was so thin, crispy & yummy! Anyways, cool thing about this place is it's bike & dog friendly!
Positive	I ordered fried pork chop, broccoli & rice casserole, and fried squash. The food is good but can use some seasoning. The portions and price are worth the trip. I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.
Positive	Great marisco place, the inside is rwally nice & clean.  The food was great! Only small complaint is for being a Mexican restaurant they were playing 60's english music, didnt go with the theme. Lol
Positive	Experimac, is a genuine service provider. The are really serious about their customers and adding value to their service. I had an issue with the service and their Manager Nadine took it seriously and pursued out of her way to resolve my problem and finally ensured that I was happy.
Positive	"Great place for brunch - you can even make a reservation for seatings before 10am!  Their eggs bennies are solid - but the real star of their brunch are the homefries slathered in ""legendary sauce""; I don't know what's in that sauce but it's really delicious!!"
Positive	"Great drinks, Great Jukebox, Great decor. Not much more has to be said but I'll throw a little in there. 

Free pool during the day on Sundays is a nice bonus and the previously mentioned decor is dark with lots of wood and some tuck and roll booths. That and the great bar tending staff make me feel like I'm back home at a bar in New England and not the hot dusty desert.
Always a very enjoyable experience. Highly recommended."
Positive	"I've had this place on my bookmark list quite sometime - likely ever since I absolutely fell in love with the junction location (Cantina). The rustic/industrial decor, the fast, friendly and knowledgeable staff and, most of all the amazing  food. 

The other Playa Cabana locations are definitely pure Mexican as a majority with hints of other cuisine here and there. However, If the neighborhood didn't give it away, This spot is basically the Canadian born offspring of a Mexican and Korean. The local Korean neighborhood influence on the menu, from bulgogi shrimp tacos, to kimchi to a style of Korean fried chicken (in a taco) that I can't even pronounce. 

The decor is true to the brand, as mentioned it's a rustic, vintage look, kind of a hodgepodge of antique and garbage. My friend commented that this looked like a cartel hangout in Mexico... That was owned by a Korean family. 

For food we started with a few shareable apps amongst the 5 of us. Grilled calamari (so spicy but so amazingly delicious), Korean style short ribs (so meaty, lots of fat but I was glad we we're sharing because it was too salty for my taste to eat a whole portion), and the guacamole (because it's Plays Cabanas brainchild and obvi). 

For mains I went with 3 tacos (a classic move and really the only smart choice). I had the Korean fried chicken taco who's name is longer than I could pronounce, the bulgogi shrimp taco and the cabanas signature taco the beef short rib (although it fits in here more than any of the other locations). 

Service was pretty good and food was flying quick. The single bathroom was a bit odd with its vintage pinball game over the toilet (I would play it even if it did work - you only have so many hands in a bathroom as a guy and at one point or another they're both ""occupied""). 

Cocktails were awesome I had the Mezcal mule (a couple of times) which is basically a superior mule and makes the original taste like 'ass' (get it). Followed up by a couple rounds of corona and our night was set. 

Well done. I approve and will return for that calamari app and 3 rounds of bulgogi shrimp tacos! Yum!

Eatcrest Out!"
Positive	"Some of the best pizza in the city. ""Fancy"" flavours like Cowspiracy and Halifax Explosion provide a delicious twist to a familiar classic. Quality ingredients, meticulously crafted dough, and Canada's best smoked meats set Conspiracy apart from the rest."
Positive	"I have been to Amelie's twice, both times in the middle of the night. Even at all hours of the morning the staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. The decor is absolutely adorable. The mismatched plates do nothing but add to the ambiance.

The deserts are beautiful for sure. They are pretty good, but I didn't quite do my ""Happy Food Dance"" from anything that I tried. I will continue to stop by if I'm in the area and enjoy my selections, but I don't know if I'd make the trip out to the neighborhood just to go there."
Positive	Everytime we come here, we always order the family feast. The serving is overwhelming. I love the ribs and brisket. (the sides too!) Can't get enough of it. The ambiance is nice too. I just wish the servers a little more attentive to the tables they're serving cox the last time we were there, it took a while before the waiter refilled our drinks.
Positive	Earlier today was my first time there and I must admit it was a huge burrito! I had white rice, pinto beans, steak, guacamole, and lettuce. The big serving made me full till dinner, but honestly it was delicious! And the service was very fast as well with a very nice gal at the register. Only reason I gave it 4 instead of a 5 is because the guacamole was a bit too pricy for my taste, but it still was delicious!
Positive	"In the mood for some Thai food, I had a look at other Thai places in Whitby. Nothing really interested me until I saw this place on Yelp, and I'm glad I did.

I usually drive by this major intersection at Thickson/Hwy2 so when looking for it I was puzzled since I haven't seen this before. It's tucked away in a small strip mall but don't let the look of the place or its location fool you.

This place was packed on a Friday night. The decor is nothing to admire, but with this place it kinda fit. 

Ordered the lemongrass veggie soup, lemongrass chicken, and the Thai green curry chicken. All of it was amazing, very flavourful.

The service was good also.

Finally glad to see that a real Thai restaurant has arrived in Whitby."
Positive	"On any frigid, nose-numbing, teeth-chattering Wisconsin winter day, Paul & his gilded pel'meni can be counted on to efficiently & deliciously warm the belly, soul, and possibly even the loins with his particular brand of expertly spiced & stuffed dumplings (get the works). 
One sentence review!"
Positive	This was a little far out from where I live, but I was in search of fresh pita bread and some other items. This place is pretty much on the corner of 19th & Pinnacle Peak and in front of the Hilton Hotel. They have a very clean small market, but they carry everything you could want for in cooking middle eastern foods.  The also have a nice deli where they prepare fresh foods.  I tried their hummus which was very good. They did indeed have pita bread, nice and fresh; nice fresh vegetables, bakalava and other pastries as well as the previously mentioned food.   Their prices are very reasonable and the owners couldn't be nicer!  They carry items like tahini, olive oil, olives, dates, dried garbanzo beans, all sorts of spices, Turkish Delight (a sweet), tea, pita bread, fresh vegetables, just to name a few items. You won't be disappointed!
Positive	"Clean salon that provides great services. My no-chip manicures always last at least three weeks. I like to make appointments to avoid waiting but they do take walk-ins as well. 

I like that they take their time as well. I have never left disappointed."
Positive	Came here twice and both times we were seated quickly and the food arrive within 5 mins of ordering. The fresh squeezed oj was good the first time but the second time it tasted a little weird but I'll blame it on bad batch of oranges other than that the food was delicious
Positive	I came here last night with my mom and loved it! The service was wonderful; warm, friendly, funny! The food was excellent. The falafel (true to the restaurant's name) was the best I've ever had! I doubt I'll find anything on the menu I won't enjoy! I will definitely be coming back.I even signed up for yelp just to review this awesome, local restaurant!
Positive	"I dyed my hair and the color was lavender-ash, I think. I really like it! Also, Masa was very nice. He understood my request and preferences completely. The total cost was $96 + tip. I hope that it was a little more reasonable tho... This is why my review is not full.
Also, I saw some reviews that said like ""it was totally different from my order."" I guess they should show the stylist some pics that are close to the hair style that they want, then explain the all details of your ideals. I always show pics, tell my likes and dislikes, and say I wanna keep the good color as much as possible to the hair stylist. So I've never gotten a bad hair style at Japanese hair salons. They're professionals.
Anyway, I'll go there again."
Positive	Excellent Sushi and very flexible staff - the Sushi was better tasting than quite a bit of upscale restaurants. The staff was able to make modifications due to my dietary restrictions.
Positive	The pizza and wings were both very good. Pizza wasn't greasy and the dough and crust were crisp. We had honey bbq wings. The sauce was very good and wings were cooked very well.  Will be going back.
Positive	Holy waffles, this place is good!  While going on a staycation in Scottsdale, we came to this place for breakfast and the food was phenomenal.  We definitely got more than we needed and that is a lesson for us to know the size of our eyes to our stomach.  I wish it was closer to us because we would go here more often.  Great food, great people, great time.
Positive	"We recently moved to the Matthews area and a quick Japanese hibachi is a must have close by for us! We called in two pick up orders last night. Upon arrival I was so excited to learn they have a drive thru! I can get Japanese food And not get dressed?? Yes please!

The food was delicious. I thought it was slightly better than the usual Japanese takeout/fast food. That being said I did not enjoy the extra charge for the ""steak sauce"". Also known as soy ginger. They give you a complimentary 3 oz shrimp sauce but any other sauce is 1$ per extra sauce. At other places I have seen they give all the sauces away. 

Overall great food, quick and easy location, up charge for sauce. Definitely better than the burger and fries fast food option."
Positive	"First time  trying this  Restuarant as I have just moved to this  area in Sep. I have tried a couple  other places  and to put  it mildly they SUCKED i think  I have only  read 2 negative  reviews on this place but I want to say one word.DELICIOUS.  Old school Chinese  food exactly what I have been looking  for. Ordered dinner fir 2 A comes with 2 egg rolls  fried rice sweet and sour pork  and General Tso Chicken.  It was fantastic
 Great food Ding Ho. You now have another  regular customer."
Positive	"I can't believe it took me two years living in Charlotte to finally eat here!

Bonus-We had a great parking space and didn't have to park far at all!!

Came here for my husband's birthday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes but didn't wait long at all. Maybe 15 minutes. They have a good mix of specialty drinks. I wanted to get a milkshake but was too full to get it. 

We got the crab dip. I saw it was highly recommended on YELP and was very pleased. It's a very large portion. We could barely finish it. The dip was creamy with large chunks of crab in it. Chips were large and crispy. That sauce that's on it really made it delicious. Everything mixed together was just amazing!! 

I got the shrimp tempura roll. I was surprised at how big it was. It was awesome, especially with the siracha sauce. I also got the Taste Explosion roll. It was my first roll like that. It was flat with ground beef, jalepenos, onions, some type of amazing sauce with a tomato and cilantro sauce on it with cheese. It was wrapped with seaweed and rice. It was delicious!! It was large and very filling. Ground beef was amazing. 

My husband got the firecracker roll. He said it was one of the best sushi rolls he's ever had. He also said he can tell the ingredients were really good quality and very fresh. 

I secretly told our server, Bryan that it was my husband's birthday and he made it so special. They came out and sang to him and gave us a birthday cake! The cake was huge! Chocolate layers with an awesome layer up top. Bryan was such a great server. He was very helpful and was super attentive. Highly recommended!!"
Positive	We used Outdoor Xscapes a couple years ago for our first initial project (some basic landscaping with pavers, travertine, lawn, etc), and we contacted them for a second round a few weeks ago, this time to build a bbq, fireplace, and a couple walls. Steve has been our designer for both projects and we could not be happier. The whole process went really smooth, the guys did a great job (the crew was really nice and super clean, and made sure that when they were done they wash the backyard area where they were working at), and completed he project to our desire. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Outdoor Xscapes to anyone looking for a great landscaper. Thank you guys!!
Positive	My wife and I have made this place our go to place for sweet ice creams, fresh fruit combinations, or corn in a cup. All are delicious, and the staff can prepare whatever you want, however you want it. Their new flavor is Mazapan ice cream! A must have! Very friendly staff, and lastly don't forget to get the fresh Horchata drink while you are at it. Delicious!
Positive	This is such a great and quaint place! The food is exceptional and has a very awesome fresh, homemade, and made-to-order taste that makes it a lot better than most other places. The portions are also Huge for their price and we always have to pack some to go. The owners are also super nice and friendly and will look after their customers right. Amazing discovery!
Positive	To give El Jefe it's chance is difficult. It's the kind of place that you either like or dislike with an undying passion. I have been coming for a few years now and it does not disappoint. The music is great the crowd is diverse and there is always a familiar face. That being said it is often far too crowded on Friday nights and fights are frequent to put it mildly. But Jefe has become a Mill icon nonetheless. I will continue to go there for the nostalgia alone. If you ever go on taco Tuesday's order the fried avocado tacos. They are incredible!
Positive	"Came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm. It was very quiet, but started filling up a bit by 8. The food was fine but came out a bit slow (not buffet style) and everything was mild for my tastes even though I asked for the food to be spicy. My parents loved it.
I liked the tandooori sampler. The lamb vindaloo was tasty. The paneer tikka masala had a very mild creamy flavor. The garlic naan was what I expected: naan with garlic. Can't go wrong there. Other condiments were served at the table and were fine. 
The service was very polite and I really appreciated it, however our bill was delivered to the table next to us. All the dishes were little pricy for me; it was $4 for just plain white rice. My family liked the food overall though, and the location is convenient."
Positive	It was very nice to work with you and the personnel from your company. You are more than welcome to come back to Pressure Systems, we are always here to help.
Positive	"It was a Saturday night, my LV partner-in-crime and I were in the Aria Hotel, and decided to dine at Julian Serrano after reviewing the menu. Truth be told, since this resto name somewhat resembles mine (as people have mispronounced and called me by this name along with others- ask me about if you're interested), dining here was really a no-brainer. hah! With no reservations, we chanced it and apparently lady luck was on our side, as there was no wait. 

The warm colors of the restaurant looked so inviting. Here's a pic of the bar area, taken with my iPhone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=0OlrsQnQXZSPeD5NFJMvmA
From our table, here's a shot of the entire restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GblIBlQF3t_da6M1L-zYbw

Everything on the menu looked so delicious, so we ordered (and pics credit go to my girl, Li):
- Beet Salad: Roasted and oh so beetalicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=758bzflJcsXww0Lrl4dYeA

- Beef with Brie: Tender pieces, with brie, (one of my fav cheeses). Oh Mylanta, such a digalicious combo, and with walnuts on top, and the savory sauce was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=ILrElkjFRWwhzXsjWWQ8xA

- Striped bass: Fresh fish, cooked to perfection. Delish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=z4xiwtEsBVbf-jFhDgX7AA

- Creamy Risotto with Mushrooms and Manchego: Mouth watering deliciousness, and so rich, creamy, and cheesey goodness!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=bJAq88XYZOcUhvlGSTUkuA

- Pan Manchego: Spanish Toast with roasted tomato and garlic paste with melted Manchego cheese. All I have to say is mas pan, mas pan! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=HLxPDvdXAqwLErnnHtCVdw

-Chocolate Cake: Chocolate molten cake, which rivals my favorite chocolate souffle at Roy's Hawaiian restaurant. Combined with mango sorbet, and I was in dessert heaven with these two loves of mine.

While we feasted so well, our beverages were refreshing white sangria (para mi) and red sangria (para mi amiga), and later had very 'brave' coffee. We needed the caffeine jolt, as it was only the beginning of a very fun and memorable night out.

Que bueno, Julian Serrano! Beautiful interior, efficient service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. This is a great restaurant for a date, a small or big group of friends, and perfect for getting the night started off right in Sin City! Viva Las Vegas!!"
Positive	for sure, the shell on lee is the cheapest, consistantly too. today i got gas for $2.99, when directly across the street and everwhere else was $3.19 (and cedar hill sunoco was $3.24) a friend clued me in to this find, and i've never found it to be more expensive than competitors in the area. go here!
Positive	I was very impressed! Great selection of wines by the glass!  I got the chicken pan seared - and it was amazing! The Mac and cheese was to die for!  I started with the house salad - I recommend this salad- wonderful goat cheese and pecans added so much flavor!!!  I would go back! Service was outstanding!!!!
Positive	"I've been here countless times (because it's right next to Dee's) and it's amazing. Also, to avoid line-ups from the more popular Bombay Mahal or Punjab Palace nearby, this location is better. AND it's BYOB! Order anything, you can't go wrong. 

The mixed appetizer platter, chana samosa and fish pakoras as very yummy appetizers. As entrees, the chicken tikka sizzler, mango chicken curry and butter chicken thali are great - not to mention their regular, garlic and onion naan. YUM, everything was on point and would go again. Affordable and delicious. My only comment: their butter chicken is a little too sweet."
Positive	"I just had Drop Shades install automatic interior blinds in my condo at Veer and they are amazing.  Having a single, solid cover instead of three separate panels does a much better job of keeping the sunlight out during the day and the lights from the strip out at night.

It was not an easy task for these guys to get the single rolls into my condo but they have a lot of experience at Veer and they knew exactly what had to be done.  Shawn was very patient with me and showed me the work that they had done in the sales office so that I knew exactly what I was getting.

The blinds are installed as close to the window as possible so I ended up getting a few precious square feet back as usable space in my condo.  That alone covered some of the cost of the blinds!

It was a great experience working with Shawn - his responsiveness and feedback was great well."
Positive	"This is not my fave campus...but that's due to the people who attend here. Most of my classes are filled with dingy high schoolers.  Always plan to grab the door because NO ONE here looks behind them to open the door for others, it is SO rude. Most students here are pretty stuck up..the students at Cheyenne are much friendlier by far. 

The good : parking is very accessible and never cutthroat like other campuses.  Very clean and nice campus. I love the spaced out open layout. 
The computer lab is never overfilled and the i.t peeps are very helpful. The front desk lady always keeps chocolates and snacks for students to get a sugar buzz before a test. 

I love csn and like most things in life it is completely up to you what your experience is like. This campus is near my house and very nice..however due to the rude students ill probably trek across town to Cheyenne.  

Courtesy is contagious...be aware of fellow students and make friends."
Positive	I love this concept so much! The girls and I were on our Happy Hour Hop when we decided to try out Cork and Thorn. The reviews on here aren't lying. This place is so cute and the service is amazing! We came in on Friday around 5 so there was no performances yet. They have weekly events every night and a different theme for each night. It's a wine bar that also does floral arrangements. The decor is eye catching! Will took care of us and he was the best! He suggested wines to all of our likings and was very friendly! Get the MOJITO WINE! I really loved the  rose petals that were thrown on to our table! It's so pretty in here and I couldn't stop thinking that from the ground to the ceiling. I will definitely be returning here to have drinks again with friends!
Positive	I was starving and looking for a decent place to eat other than some fast food chain joint. With the help of yelp I went to this place. The black bean salad was so good full of flavor, I could have just had that and been happy but I got the lentil stew & saffron brown rice along with it that was a lovely addition to the meal.
Positive	"PetSmart is a great, not good, but a great pet store! 

We have shopped here and at several other locations in four different states with always the same high quality results. We have also used their pet adoption services, as well as their pet grooming which is also great! 

Nice employees who really care and are very helpful. A big WOW!"
Positive	This is a fantastic place to go for a cheese Katsu. My mouth is watering when I think about it. We had Bibinboo, Cheese katsu and assorted katsu. One place is enough for one person, I recommend to have Assorted Katsu for the first visit. The butter is the best.
Positive	"Nice selection of doughnuts. I got the cronut, french cruller, apple fritter and the gentlemen at the register threw in a regular glazed for me as well. 

Overall, the doughnuts were fluffy and tasty. I did taste some of the oil they used for frying - so that's why 4 stars instead of 5."
Positive	"Went here for dinner on a Friday nite at about 9:30pm.  Didn't need a reservation.  
The atmosphere is WONDERFUL! Very dark and spiffy.

It's kind of a bordello themed place.  
We checked in the front and first asked about free club passes. The promoter was nice enough to give us passes and also give us 2 coupons for our dinner.

The coupon called for a free cocktail with your entree.

My boyfriend's plate was $19 which was the spaghetti.  It was very tasty.  Mine was about $22 and it was the stuffed ravioli with mushrooms. It was pretty good! The portions are not too big.
If you think about it, the price isn't so bad since we got the free cocktail.  Just imagine the drink is about $10 and your dinner is about another $10.  If you think about it in those terms w/ the coupon I guess it's not too bad.

The service was pretty good. The manager guy was nice to us.  The waitress seemed like her niceness was a little forced though.

The burlesque girls pretend to get ready in a dressing room behind a glass as if she's putting on a show.  It was really fun watching creepy old men get up from their seat to stare right in her window as she ignores them and continues to brush her hair and whatnot.

Oh, the food also comes with  bread."
Positive	"Sweets Raku is the real deal.  I haven't had any of their savory stuff but their desserts are top notch and the service is about as attentive as you can get without being overly intrusive.

Came here with a local friend who said I should check it out.  We had the Dessert Prix Fixe and an A La Carte dessert (they charge a little more if you split a Prix Fixe) and he also had a Prix Fixe.  When you receive the actual menu, it comes rolled up in a ring (ours was a sort of pretzel ring).  They gave us a plate of some sort of apple sauce and then game the fun part.  You dip the menu into the sauce and eat it!  Yes this is possibly very gimmicky and yes it's still AWESOME!

Our Prix Fixe started with a pear sherbet dollop that was crisp and refreshing.  The actual main was the Stella which is some sort of fantastic strawberry confection.  It was plated beautifully and had just the right amount of sweetness as well as a little bit of gold flake.  For the third course it was our choice of cream puff and it was just the right size with, again, the right amount of sweetness and sauce.  

For the A La Carte dessert, I ordered the Carib which was a mixture of cinnamon, fruit, cream, sherbet, and custard in a wine glass.  They place a thin circle of white chocolate over the top and pour a sauce on top which melts away the chocolate, dripping onto the contents of the glass.  The flavors melded well and in my opinion it was the star of the show.

Afterward we inquired about some blue sparkling wine some other guests were having and our server poured us some complimentary glasses with a couple blueberries as garnish!

I would say I was definitely blown away by the experience and actually quite upset I have not found something like it back home in SF.  

This is absolutely a gem off the Strip and I will make it a point to stop by whenever I am in town."
Positive	Delicious food and always treated great!!! Love the chicken stripes and spicy fries with the fry sauce. And the mini shakes are ginormous!!! You can substitute your drink for a mini shake, highly recommend it.
Positive	"I have been referred to this location from Nellis and so far I love it! My daughter is measuring on the small side which has caused some concern. So I am being seen here for weekly monitoring and ultrasounds. I don't really have a specific doctor just yet since I am still being seen at Nellis, but the staff has been awesome. Everyone is really friendly and makes me feel comfortable. One of the front desk ladies even helped me book a months worth of appointments all at once so that I do not have to worry about driving to a further location. 

Another huge plus is that they allow children in the monitoring room. Normally military hospitals do not allow children during appointments especially during ultrasounds. With that being said I am really grateful! I will say though some parents need to learn to keep their children a bit more quite. I say this because their children might ruin it for the rest of us lol."
Positive	"Better than expected, we had a great group meal there one night during CES with a few tough critics in attendance, and we all were pretty happy with what we got.

Definitely a bit on the expensive side, but no wait and we're in Vegas...

The wait staff there was really very good."
Positive	AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!! Great coffee and the Energy of the Staff is Incredible!!!! I always look forward to going to Dutch Bros to get my coffee!! Love Ya Dutch Bros on Bell!!!!
Positive	"I was in Vegas recently for my birthday and we decided to have a snack to break us away from gambling for a bit. The main draw was the happy hour specials for appetizers at $6 a pop. 

Upon walking in, I immediately enjoyed the interior. There was a lot of interesting things to look upon, including a gargantuan fake tree. Also, a musician started playing acoustically, which was unexpected and made the experience more fun. 

When the food arrived, we were very pleasantly surprised with the portions because we weren't expecting so much for the money we were paying. We enjoyed the spinach dip with kettle chips and the shrimp with cornbread. The cornbread was SO good and the sauce they put on the plate was a big hit with all three of us. Definitely my favorite. The wings were just average. We ended up not even finishing all of the apps, with the exception of the shrimp dish. Not bad for 18 bucks betwixt 3 people!"
Positive	Very large portions! You get your money's worth! Meats were not very seasoned, not sure if we came on an off day. I prefer my bbq to have a good dry rub and a decent amount of seasoning. But over all everything was great. Fun decor, very large and open. Will definitely be back. If the meat was seasoned better it would be 5 stars. So hopefully next time we go it will have a little more love
Positive	"This place is fantastic. Huge portions, delicious food, bomb service. Unpretentious setting - not too trendy, but clean and modern, great vibes.

The three of us first shared a MASSIVE plate of pulled pork nachos (they did not skimp! it was totally delicious and we totally devoured it) then followed it up with the sampler sliders (which were adorably plated). In order of least to most delicious, it would have to be the bison, lamb, kobe, turkey, beef, then the brisket for me. All of them were delicious with the exception of the bison - too tough and those grassy sprouts did not do it any good.

Cranberry sauce on the turkey was great although the meat itself was a bit dry. One of us really loved the lamb. Spicy ketchup on the lamb and kobe was a bit hot for me, but I'm certainly an outlier when it comes to spice. Can't go wrong with classic beef, but the brisket was two of us' definite favourite - very tender, juicy, just lovely! 

We also had some shooters which were hilariously ripe with innuendo: I Wanna Leia (delicious & sweet, kind of Kool-Aid-y), Honey Dew Me (bitter and not that tasty), Blue Balls (listerine, bleh), Broken Down Golf Cart (one of my favourites, $2 special as it's being taken off the menu, unfortunately). 

Service was top notch too. All this and splitting a Pabst comes to around $25 a person. DAMN. And those nachos - too good. We all went home with three unplanned food babies.

Final Verdict: want to come back and try everything (which I promptly did). The nachos weren't as good as the first time, but you can't go wrong with this place."
Positive	"We had 2 dogs and baby.
We love Aloft!!(this was our second time aloft stay)
Very clean room, nice bar(bartender was nice :)
Paid $50 for dogs but its refundable if dogs doesn't destroy anything.
One thing we didn't like it was waiting for pack in play about 40 min even we told them we have baby when we booked(this is hotels.com's fault?) 

But mostly very good experience.
I don't know why the review is not so good? 

If they have a bath tub and complementary  breakfast, it would be super perfect!! ;)"
Positive	So much fun!  It's like a party every night!  Cool open concept dining area, amazing tapas style Japanese food, and great beer selection!  Have gone for birthdays and work events, really good for big groups!
Positive	"Five stars.
Last Month (in March), i was hit by a huge tragedy: The death of my father.
My world turned upside down as i planned a funeral, a viewing, an estate, 
tears, flowers, memories, so much all happening at once and the pain.
We decided to display pictures of Dad at the viewing and I ran out to the staples to put together a poster to announce the military service time and date.
It was raining that day, i showed up early in the morning.
I wish i knew the name of the fabulous man who helped me at this store.
He was tall, wore a cacky shirt and dark pants, he wore glasses and he may have been a manager. 
His name escapes me at the moment but he was amazing.
He assured me it would get done, he made sure the poster got done, i saw him working on the poster himself, he even saved me money and he even asked if i liked it and offered to re do it again.
For his amazing heart and beyond this planet customer service skills, i sat down a month after to write this review. 
I wish i knew his name, he was a tall African American gentleman who went above and beyond for me during one of the most difficult times in my life.
If that is not EXCELLENCE in a world of retail and sales, i don't know what is.
I remain Forever grateful."
Positive	"My fiance and I have lived here since Aug 2016 and we don't plan to leave until we buy our house. The floorplans are smart and spacious, lovely finishes and high quality service whenever you need anything. There are 2 pools, multiple grassy areas, hammocks all over to enjoy and multiple large grilling areas with shade covers. 

TONS of closet space, I qualify this with the fact that we downsized from a 6 bedroom home after a hardship, and we have tons of storage space here! 

PET FRIENDLY! However, VERY pricey if you do not look after your pet, you MUST register with poo prints, and if your pets' waste is identified as not cleaned up, there is a huge fee ($100 the first time, goes up each time and after 3rd time you get evicted or pet has to go so be on top of it!) 

We have TWO (2) covered parking passes per unit now and its amazing for working couples. 

We LOVE the community events, they have had movie nights with complimentary grilled food, snacks, and drinks, fitness classes, wine tastings, food trucks, mimosas by the pool twice a month etc. etc. the list goes on. 

The Luxor One package lockers are our best friend. We can't rave enough about the notifications, security, and convenience of the service. I NEVER stress about my packages or mail, which is a welcome change to previous apartments we have lived in. You can access your packages without office staff present, 24/7!

There's a huge park and pond with a direct walking path for access, huge grassy area and events held at Cornerstone Park almost every weekend! If you like being active, this is a great place for you. 

Random complaints but certainly not deal breakers for us: 1. The sink faucets are too short and they make a mess every time you wash your hands- my guests complain that its weird and messy and splashes all over- I'd like them to fix this but not sure if I can ask for that but its a complaint I have heard from everyone else that lives here. We keep a lot of hand towels out. 2. The carpet is very thin, like an office space, not even close to plush enough for a home setting but again, not a big deal for us, just noticeable. 

As far as staff, Kaitlyn has been our go-to girl for her warmth, kindness and ability to get things done for your with empathy and a smile. No issues at all with any other staff as well, which is great. 

If you can afford this place, we say go for it! you will love it :)"
Positive	"Michael's is my favorite dessert-type stop in Madison. You see ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt all over the place. But frozen custard is a superior breed of dairy goodness.

I never get tired of Michael's custard. They offer many mixes and flavors, and each one can quench your cravings. It's pricier than ice cream, but that's because, again, frozen custard is superior."
Positive	"I wanted to choose a bank that mostly deals with Arizona and read the reviews on here about MidFirst Bank and it sounded like what my husband and I were looking for.
WOW! We were very impressed by the bank when we arrived and found ourselves actually enjoying opening an account and Adrian Erivez. Not only did he greet us but he made us feel very much at ease and comfortable about being there. He not only gave us information on the bank itself but advised us on all the services they provide.
What struck me the most was that this is how banks used to be. Open and friendly yet business like and not at all like the ""big"" banks out there. 
The tellers welcome you and really enjoy being there. We were offered cold bottled water which was greatly welcomed since it was a HOT day.
We want to see the other branch locations since Adrian let us know how nice alot of them are as well as from what I've read here.
This is the bank you might want to consider if you're tired of the mega banks."
Positive	"The service is great. We got greeted right away, and we were even checked on as we were eating. Management were also on top of things.

I recommend the guac burger! The skinny fries are not my thing, but they were still good. And finally, a burger place were they have both pickled and raw jalapeños! 

I suggest they put in a ketchup pump."
Positive	I used The Mechanics regularly 20 years ago when it was run by Jaye's dad, Tony.  I moved back to Calgary about a year ago and I have used The Mechanics a couple of times on my old Volvo V70 XC. I have had great, honest service.  Jaye also stuck exactly to a quote that he gave me on replacement of the rear differential even though the job took much longer than anticipated.
Positive	I have tried TONS of barbers in town and Carl's is hands down the best- no doubt about it. The cut is fast, spot on, and was only 8 BUCKS!! I am super picky about my haircuts and was absolutely thrilled with how he did. I'lll be coming back for sure! Thanks for the fantastic cut Carl.
Positive	Always love the food and the atmosphere the only problem is sometimes there a very long whites to get in when there is a convention in town. So I suggest you make a reservation ahead of time.
Positive	I have been coming here for years. One of my favorites is the green chili  burro enchilada style. Would highly recommend eating here if you have not already. My favorite Mexican food in the valley
Positive	"Great service!  We ordered a take out and they were very kind to separate items and made everything that much fresher for when we got to our destination. 

 The location was good and looked like a fun place to enjoy a meal. Was actually surprised by their outdoor seating area and that they had beer. In Vegas you can't find many places that offer a cute outdoor area and this one looked nice and tucked in and back a little from the sidewalk. Nice ambiance. 

The sandwiches were yummy but couldn't imagine having them daily for sake of calorie intake. 

The Surfin Cow on Sourdough was stacked high with roast beef and they absolutely don't skimp on the cream cheese. 

Marley Nachos were my favorite. I loved the melted cheese with added bonus of gobs of cream cheese. I'm a tomato fan and these were fresh and tasty.

Hobie- was so good with the dressing. And again they were so nice to put the dressing on the side so the sandwich wasn't soggy. We had plenty of left overs to make multiple meals out of one order.

Potato Salad was also amazing in taste and freshness."
Positive	This is our go-to movie theaters. It is clean and the stuffs are friendly. It is not as busy compared to San Tan or Chandler Mall. Sometimes I cannot find a parking spot at the theater by the mall and had to go home. It never happen at Crossroad.
Positive	"I decided it was time to visit the dermatologist and made an appointment here a little more than a month ago. I was scheduled for June 23rd, but they had a cancellation and I'd put my name on a waiting list to be called in the event that happened. So, lucky me!

I showed up here a few minutes later than I needed to, but it wasn't a problem. The staff was friendly and I was seen quickly by Dr. Rita George. She did a full body check and I didn't even feel very awkward wearing the giant paper towel they gave me. 

She was nice, but still businesslike. I thought the nurse who was helping her was really friendly, but I didn't catch her name. She wound up doing a biopsy on my arm, but they were quick and professional and I have to say, for what was being done it was a pleasant experience. 

They told me I would get my results in about a week, but two days later they gave me the call and let me know everything was fine (basically, it wasn't the ""c"" word like I'd feared). She wrote me a prescription and I went and picked it up yesterday at my convenience (basically, before 5pm). 

If I have any more skin related issues, I'll definitely come here."
Positive	"If you love seafood, this buffet is for you. It was enjoyable even for someone like me who doesn't really care for seafood. It is a bit expensive at $40/person but we had a buy one get one free coupon so I'm not complaining :)

We're at a seafood buffet so we piled on the seafood! Shrimps, crab legs, raw oysters...yumm. THEY HAVE SASHIMI! I love you sashimi. After 2 full plates of seafood, I was seafood-ed out! Time to check out the dessert. They have an ice cream wheel, awesome! I tried the coffee and mango flavors. They also had an ""Elvis"" flavor...I wonder how Elvis taste like haha.

Overall a happy dining experience and wouldn't mind coming back on our next trip."
Positive	"This is my favorite Pizza in town, and a family favorite since the 50's.  So glad it's back, and better than ever!  I remember moving ""Back East"" with mom in 79 from San Fransisco, and this was our destination upon leaving the airport.  Great memories.

Used to be you would get 1 poorly made Pizza in 3 here, and bad service, but you stuck with it because it's just so unique, so good, and so full of nostalgia.  Now under new family operation, all 7 pizza's I have got from them have been perfect!  So so happy Vincent's is back, and just as good as back-in-the-day."
Positive	"We've only been to Pittsburgh twice and we've visited this place both times. I mean, a church converted into a brewery?! That's just awesome.

I greatly enjoyed sitting in a pew and drinking a beer, plus every beer I've tried has been great: the first time I visited I chose a red ale and the second time I tried their winter ale, plus I tried my partner's tripel belgian and our friend's IPA.

On our second visit I ordered a zucchini pasta dish, which was spiraled zucchini with mushroom and lentil falafel-like balls and tomato sauce, it was pretty good, but way too salty and they should seriously cut back on the amount of salt they use in that dish. If I were reviewing just my dish, I would give 3 stars, but since the concept is so cool and the beer is great, 4 is fair. We also ordered pita and hummus and that was delicious.

I'd definitely go back, but I wouldn't order the same meal again."
Positive	Had a delicious brunch here this am. Husband is not much of an IPA guy so the scottsdale blonde was suggested and he enjoyed it. I had sangria which was tasty. Our meals were Turkey bacon Benedict on homemade biscuits with green chili hollidaise sauce and the biscuits with schiners local sausage and beer gravy. Pleased with both. Great space in historic Garfield district building. Supports local artist with shows as well. We will be back.
Positive	"I came here with my sister for a girly pamper-me day. We took advantage of the $39 hour long massages. There's no catch to the price, but you only get to use that rate once and they tell you about their membership options. No pressure to join. 

The interior is simple and calming. The masseuses were professional. My massage was extremely relaxing. Payment was swift and easy. 

All in all, a very relaxing, enjoyable experience."
Positive	Better than average Filipino fast food place. Only thing sucks is that Filipino food is always over priced. For 2 ppl my mom and I spend almost $30 for lunch on a 2 item combo with a spring roll.  Food was really good though.  Flavor was good not to salty.
Positive	"Going to Wahlburgers was on my list for my first time in Vegas and it was great! I had the ""Our"" burger and it did not disappoint. The sweet potato tots were also great. I hope to go back again before I have to go home."
Positive	First time for me at Il Capo. I got here earlier than my friends but they sat me down anyway. I had coffee while waiting. We took a while to place our order but the waitress didn't seem to mind. I had the Caesar Salad & Arancini for my dinner. I didn't realize I would get 2 rice balls so I took one home. Food was delicious and server was patient & accommodating. I will definitely be back.
Positive	"THIS IS FOR THE CRISPY PORK BELLY SLIDERS ONLY ****

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=xEF1cmAPXZksUYtU3OGNZA

O.M.G. This was AMAZING. I'm Chinese, meaning I'm used to eating Peking Duck at every single big family dinner, so my palette for this dish is highly refined. But shoooot this crispy pork belly is a delicious rendition of the Peking Duck...dare I say even BETTER than the OG dish??

+ The pork belly is PERFECTLY cooked. Crispy on the outside (a little bit of burnt so you can taste the smokiness!), and extremely tender inside.
+ Fresh cilantro and herb complements, with jalapenos on the side for those non-spicy eaters!
+ Hoisin sauce is a must! XOXO
+ LOVED the buns! Although it was thick, it complemented all the ingredients and didn't leave you feeling that you just ate too much dough
+ It was NOT dripping with oil!!! I'm in Vegas, so I don't want to feel more bloated from anything else (except from the alcohol of course), and surprisingly, this didn't make me feel disgusting afterwards!
+ The best part? It came in 3! Sharing is caring (:

Definitely zee best dish at Holsteins. Forget the burgers, CRIPSY PORK BELLY FTW!"
Positive	I got coffee here every morning and they did a great job making it.  I have a specific order and just once they got it wrong, but remade it fast.  Good, quick service!
Positive	Tony was the bomb! This place has such a relaxing and chill vibe. We sampled some beef jerky and got to pick what we enjoyed. Definitely worth coming here, especially for some real beef jerky! Amazing place!
Positive	"If you are in the mood for the olde curiosity shoppe experience -- where umpteen bajillion bits of old china and tchotckes are piled high and deep on the shelves, and you're on a treasure hunt to find the amazing widget at the bottom of the pile -- this place is fab. If you're not in that mood, your head may explode before you navigate the first aisle.

DO:
--Wear clothing that will not catch on protruding objects.
--Shop here while well-rested, well-hydrated, and on a day when one's joints feel flexible.
--Be careful yet bold about figuring out what the thingie behind the six rows of other thingies might be.
--Collect bottles, shot glasses, small pitchers, and other random china. There is a lot of it here. There's a lot of other stuff, too -- jewelry, bits of glass, figurines, handkerchiefs, and (if memory serves) rusted stirrups. Can I really be remembering rusted stirrups correctly?
--Bring cash or plan to spend generously, as the owner doesn't take plastic for purchases below $10.

DON'T:
--Bring children, unless you have one whose major joy in life is to sit on the floor and oh-so-carefully move pieces of china off the shelf to see what's at the back, then oh-so-carefully put them back. That child, you should hire out as a personal shopper. More vigorous or less patient urchins will not do well in the confined space.

--Visit while tired, in a hurry, or carrying a large purse. You will be stressed-out from trying not to break anything and won't get the full effect.

This shop has been here for 46 years, so who knows what's at the bottom of that pile on the back shelf!"
Positive	"Fish tacos, chips & guacamole, and edamame appetizers from their happy hour: five stars!
Happy hour stick options: five stars!
Parking options: 3 stars--but this one can't be helped. The valet recommended parking at Shasta the pool service store nearby during dinner.

I enjoyed the ambience here, and the service was decent. We stayed for quite a while and weren't given any flak for it, and it was pretty busy for a Thursday night. I like that their happy hour pricing is more than just a dollar off their typical menu prices."
Positive	"I thought my daughter was going to have a miserable time at the dentist. It was our first dentist visit and she is 23 months old. Dr. Cotton and her staff were amazing!!!! They let her get comfortable in the office and the hygienist even blew bubbles for her while I visited with the dentist! It is nice to know there are people in the medical (especially pediatric dentistry) world that are genuine and caring. 

Oh and my daughter let them brush her teeth and has let me too ever since this visit! They have the golden touch."
Positive	I am going on a girls' trip and wanted to be tan; I found Jacey through a thorough internet, Facebook, and Yelp search. I was nervous that she was too good to be true! 2 weeks of a tan for $30?! However, it was seriously the best $30 I've spent! Jacey is so, so sweet and professional - she makes your feel comfortable stripping down for the spray tan. There's no odor, no weird sticky feeling, and no orange color at all! I 100% recommend her to anyone and everyone looking for spray tan! She truly is 5 star!!
Positive	"Fun place to go.  Consistent food, friendly service, and cheap prices.  Huge selection as well for a restaurant of this size.

I am hesitant to write reviews of my favorite spots as I fear they will 'blow up,' become too crowded and in turn the quality will go down.  But this place has already been discovered on the internet so I feel there is no harm done.

Please be polite, quiet, and tip well to keep this place as good as it has been."
Positive	The pizza here is different then what you'll typically find in AZ, thin NY style slices that taste even better then they smell and they smell amazing. Nice variety of lunch options that are reasonably priced and will fill you up! Every time I've been here the food comes out ready to eat perfect temp. Never dripping cheese off the sides, greasy, or too hot burning your mouth with the first bite, keep it up
Positive	"Keep in mind that this is the review of a diner... Not some fancy haute cuisine. It is amazing.

Everything we had was complex and well balanced. I was stunned at how the quality of the ingredients came across in each dish we tasted. 

Quick review of what we had:
Cesar salad: Amazing... Served deconstructed, not your ordinary plain salad. 
Ahi tuna tacos: excellent even if a tad too sweet for me.
Chicken and waffles: best I've had so far!
Lobster rolls: a classic well done.
Disco fries: basically poutine, only way better. 

Service was excellent. Staff is busy but remains very friendly.

Will definitely go back soon to try more of their delicious creations."
Positive	"Stopped for a drink and an appetizer at the bar. Greeted as soon as we sat down. Great service. 

The restaurant itself is very nice/clean inside. They have a good selection of beers on tap. We ordered the nachos from the menu. It was a large portion, very good. I recommend checking Babes out. We will defianately be back."
Positive	Great gourmet cinnamon buns with a variety of toppings! I tried the rocky road cinnamon bun. The bun was very large, and it came warm with loads of toppings. It was topped with chocolate chips, nuts , marshmallows and a sweet sauce. This dessert was big enough for two people to share. All the ingredients were fresh and the toppings were freshly added when I ordered it. A definite recommend for your sweet tooth!
Positive	"I have been here twice now, once to see Davina for a massage through Groupon,  the 2nd time was with Bonnie for an hour massage and 30 minute facial.  They were both great and the massages were amazing.  Bonnie did extremely well, she was very knowledgeable with my facial and made me feel comfortable, she explained all the products she was using and gave me recommendations on how to take better care of my skin.   I was a frequent Dolce customer but now I have converted to just seeing these guys.  They also have very competitive prices for their services compared to other places I have frequented.

I will be a returning customer :)"
Positive	"Zwembad bestaat uit vier zwembaden waarvan één (betaalde) adult pool. Adult pool is afgesloten d.m.v. een hek. Tijdens mijn verblijf was een zwembad gesloten. Verder waren alle baden open. Bij het 'hoofd' zwembad zal je de meeste drukte vinden en ook (vrij harde) muziek. Er zijn in principe genoeg vrije bedjes maar rond 11:00 is het behoorlijk druk. Handdoeken krijg je op vertoon van je hotelpas bij de ingang van het zwembad.

Nadelen: alcohol drinkende Amerikanen op, in en langs het zwembad. Heeft meer iets met hygiëne te maken dan dat je er daadwerkelijk heel veel last van hebt. Zwembad water was ook wat aan de koude kant in mei."
Positive	"Jessica is the best of the best! I've been going to her for a couple years now and have gone to other lash artists before and after her(when she wasn't available), and can honestly say that she is dedicated to her work and it shows. She's always willing to work with you on what you want and always come out loving my lashes. 
Jessica is super easy going and funny which makes it relaxing to lay there for 1-2 hours, I'm somewhat of a fidgety person so the fact that she can make me feel at ease and comfortable is a plus!"
Positive	"Really like this place, sat at the bar by myself, got the shrimp & lobster roll and the Caesar salad. The bartender was super friendly and when I lamented that I should have brought my laptop to work, he let me go upstairs to grab it to do some work while I was eating. He also recommended that I check in to get the sticky toffee pudding.

I'd recommend all the food I got, it was really delicious. The Caesar salad was perfect with white anchovies, fresh shaved parmasean, creamy dressing, crispy housemade croutons & fresh romaine lettuce. The shrimp & lobster roll was a little on the small side, but was an appetizer after all, but all in all very good, fresh chunks of lobster & shrimp with some celery and mayo on a buttery roll with a few micro greens on the top. The sticky toffee pudding really topped off my meal, really meant for at least 2 people, but really decadent and caramelly."
Positive	One one the best views in Vegas. You will spend a good amount on dinner but it will be an evening you wont forget. I find it very difficult to find something to eat in fine-dining restaurants because I am so picky but this experience was not really about the food. A good way to capture the ambiance with out the price is to visit for drinks and dessert.
Positive	"This is my second time visiting this place and is worthy write a review. Last time I had the tacos and this time I had a burrito ~delicious and consistent on the flavor of the food~a nice simple menu of choices~the cook is the most down to earth person and come to find out he is also the owner ""Gerardo""  I love it when I find a place that is not a chain of fast food, this place by far is now on my list of favorite Mexican food!"
Positive	"I absolutely love this community and love the amenities they offer. The complex is always well maintained, the units are beautiful, and the people in the community are very friendly and amazing. 

The best part is that my first impression of the staff in our front office was not far from the truth. I have the pleasure of dealing with Monique and Sonia and they are beyond wonderful. 

Sonia and Monique are very cordial with the residents and every time I come into the office, they make me feel like I'm their most valued resident - which is awesome because it makes me feel very appreciated and that just adds a level of value that can't be bought. In addition to that, I often get to see them handle other residents and their customer service is incredible and consistent. 

I appreciate being able to have such great support and service from Sonia and Monique. They bring a culture to Adobe Ridge that is unmatched. If you're looking for apartment living that comes with class, style, and great service - this is where you want to be!"
Positive	We had such a wonderful time here! Happy hour was wonderful and good was delish! The prosecco wasn't the best but the rose we had was very good! We especially loved the cheese board! We will definitely return!
Positive	"It isn't necessary to get quality hair care by paying outlandish prices or going to rumored high end salons. Hair by Jonathon is somewhat of a neighborhood salon, which means to me, I don't have to jump through hoops and battle insane traffic and parking to get my hair done. Although the parking lot is not huge, I have always been able to park within a very short distance of the front door.
 
Jonathon has been been a stylist for years. He is as good as they come. Not only is he a great hair stylist, he is a really nice person. He knows how to provide customer service and satisfaction which is sincere and not just lip service. He is calm, pleasant, friendly and hands on in his salon. I have noticed he has students there from time to time and I commend him for giving those new to the profession, real life experience not only in styling matters but business matters and salon operations. This is a critical point for anyone who plans to take their career down that path.

On occasions that I need an appointment and Jonathon is not available, there has always been another stylist who can fit me in. Not to worry. Jonathon oversees all of the work done by the stylists in his shop and is as I mentioned, hands on  with all clientele.

Now, as for cost. The convenient location and general ease of booking an appointment is important to me as many others I'm sure. I find the prices to be competitive and reasonable. In fact, I would have to say very reasonable.

I have seen everyone from children to adults at this salon, male and female. The salon offers services other than hair styling, also. I always leave feeling refreshed and as one would after just having a pleasant experience. Jonathon knows nearly every customer by name and the personal touch he provides in his salon speaks for itself."
Positive	Amazing food and service. My party arrived early and was able to be seated right away. The place seemed busy. I have to commend the hostess who sat us. My sister uses a wheelchair and I really appreciate that the hostess asked a couple of customers to please move their seats in for the wheel chair to pass. At almost every restaurant that we have been to, myself or someone in our party would have to ask this question. The employees are truly there to give you an memorable dining experience through thoughtfulness as well as the delicious food. I had the swordfish and it was flavorful and fresh. I also tried the ribeye and fillet, both were cooked perfectly with a nice char. I was disappointed by the stone crab. They only had the medium claws. Even though they were already cracked, they were still very difficult to eat, with tiny pieces of shell all over. The meat stuck to the shell. The crab tasted very fresh and clean, but I don't think that it was worth the price and effort. The octopus was excellent tasting, but definitely not suited for sharing. The portion of octopus was small. Overall, I will absolutely be returning to Joe's on my next trip to Vegas! I would urge anyone who likes a nice cut of meat to go for the steak entree rather than the fish. The fish is delicious, but the steak was perfection!
Positive	Really excellent choice for authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. My favourite are the dosas but the entire menu is well done, using quality ingredients throughout. Highly recommended for a casual but quality meal.
Positive	I wish I could give this location more than 5 stars.  They have excellent customer service from the time you walk in the door.  We were greeted by Brittany who was very friendly and helpful, she persisted to give us all our options even letting us look at the car before rental.  The other ladies Breanna and Selena were just as friendly.  I was observing them while they assisted other customers and they too were just as helpful.  I live closer to a different location to which I had a very negative customer service experience and decided to go to this location instead to pick up my car, and I must say the service received was worth driving the extra miles.
Positive	We came here with two other couples to celebrate our wedding day. When our server found out we had just gotten married he surprised us all with a glass of champagne -Yay! The parmesan popovers were so delicious that I could have just ate that all night and been happy! My husband ordered the parm herb crusted veal chop and it was juicy and wonderful with garlic mash. I ordered the 16 oz striploin and it was cooked to perfection. The service could not have been better and the ambience was very romantic and relaxing which was the perfect end to our amazing day. We cannot wait to go back in the future!
Positive	closest breakfast place to my house. Went on my birthday as the first place i ate out at in Pittsburgh. Barb and company sang happy birthday and put a candle in a muffin for me. Good down home breakfast. Egg sandwich are good take out. ill be back
Positive	"One of the best culinary experiences we have had in quite some time!

There were three of us that went for dinner and drinks. We started with a Cellar Smash, Asian Pear, and Old Fashioned. All of the drinks were phenomenal. 

For food we all split the truffle fries, Brussels, tuna tartare, and truffle Mac. They were all so delicious that none of us could pick a favorite! The malt vinegar aioli with the fries, the balsamic reduction on the Brussels, and the smokiness of the Gouda in the mac were flavors that simply can't be beat. 

No complaints here. Well worth the time and money."
Positive	This is an awesome place for Happy Hour and delicious Chinese food.  The owner is incredibly kind, the service is great, and the value is great.  If you like Chinese food, this is a definite place to try.
Positive	If I could rate this pizzeria 10 stars, I WOULD!  Yum Yum Yum.  Good food, good prices, good service and people.  The garlic knots were delicious.  The chicken wings were off the hook!!!  The pizza.....to die for.  The cookies and cannolis topped it all off.  All together it was a great experience for our family of 7.  The owner made us feel like family.  It's hard to find a restaurant like this!  Definitely coming back again, again, and again.
Positive	Out in Twinsburg for work and wasn't expecting to find a well reviewed sushi restaurant but glad I did.  It was quite busy for a Monday and the poor waitress was slammed but the sushi chef stepped in to help and was very friendly.  The presentation and flavors were great.
Positive	"Very clean store. I like to go there for specific Korean spices and some food. Their produce is pricy. The cut and packaged meats are packaged cleanly. 

Their bakery is one of the best. Try that on your way out."
Positive	Staff here is the best out of any DD I have gone too. Go there all the time on Friday morning o get the kids a Donut. They are friendly and fast.
Positive	I stopped here with my two kids and had a great meal.  The selection was plentiful and all reasonably priced.  The salad bar was excellent, fresh and lots of choices. The mac and cheese burger was really good.  Our server was excellent and very friendly.  I would never guess in a grocery store....worth the stop!!!
Positive	"I'm not sure how the all you can eat thing works. Other people had tablets from which they were ordering. When I told the server I didn't feel like meat today she handed me the a la carte menu.
I had 2 tofu dishes that had the same ingredients just different sauces. Both were good nonetheless.
Service was typical of a restaurant like this. Efficient but not particularly personal."
Positive	"I had the same wonderful experience as Tamara P! 

I made 14.5 bottles of Italian Barolo, which are currently aging. I drank the half bottle prior to aging and, although it was just newly made, I was quite impressed with the quality. I ended up giving many bottles away to friends and I am excited to hear what they think once the aging process has been completed.

Even though it was busy when I was bottling, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The guys even carried my wine out to my car for me. They also shared with me that they have over 3,000 customers in their database for both locations so a lot can be said by that.

The only slight con I have is that the outside of the property is not properly lit so, in the winter months, it can be a bit challenging trying to see while carrying out wine. That being said, if you are bottling, I would suggest going during daylight times.

Anyway, I plan to return soon (with my own cool labels) to make a batch of Late Harvest Riesling and possible some Shiraz."
Positive	"OK, what could be better than bringing your own pizza, sharing it with the staff, and getting a great beer besides?? NADA! My husband and I have made it a mission to visit every microbrew  in the country we can and this place is the measuring stick that we compare every other place against! Too bad for them that Sleepy Dog is the BEST!
My husband loves Scotch ales, so he gets the Scootcher. My preference is a mix between the Scootcher & the Red Rover, AKA The Scootchover! I just wish they could have a little patio area so we could enjoy the nice weather as fall approaches...but I love the metal furniture that the owner has welded, repurposing old farm equipment and creating something special! Our favorite microbrew for sure!"
Positive	Ive been going to Grand China for about 4 or 5 years now. Not once have I had a bad experience. When I do eat inside the restaurant, Ive always had quick friendly service. Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7. They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice. Definitely worth it. The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras. No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials. The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit.
Positive	"For any reason at all, this place is always a good idea.

Friendly staff. Everything is fresh & made to order. Plus, you walk away entirely guilt free!!! Lol

I had the green apple detox & it was delicious. I got the small size & my cousin got the medium for only a little bit more than what I paid for. I immediately regretted not paying the little extra to get a MUCH bigger size. The cup sizes displayed don't look too different in size, but when you're actually holding the cup, the medium size is actually much bigger than the small

Overall, this is a MUST try juicery in the area & I will definitely come back when I'm in town."
Positive	"I can't tell you how happy I was with their service. My friend planned a funny 40th birthday party for her fiancee downstairs. It kinda got all jumbled up. I ran upstairs they were able to accommodate us. Manager was super nice, hostesses were too, and our waiter Christian was awesome!

about 40 patron shots later our bill was over $600 mainly from the booze and we were happy to spend it!  

Nicest service at a 'chain restaurant' that I've had.  

We ordered pasta, Chicken, Pizza, fried cheese, salad, everything we had food for days!"
Positive	"Dinner out in Champaign doesn't get much better than Sunsinger. The wine selection is extensive, and the service generally top rate. (I've had one very very poor experience with their brunch, but I won't divulge into that... I just recommend to avoid their brunch).

App: Cheese/meat plate
Wine: Malbec
Dinner: We both did the filet rare and it was cooked perfectly. The wine was a little pricier than I would have liked, but it was delicious. Enough that we did a second bottle.

If you're stopping in for lunch, their salads and the jerk chicken wrap are awesome. (It does get very busy during the weekday lunches) Also, if you need a wine gift basket, this is your place."
Positive	"Me & my wife love mexican food, so we figured we would try Monroeville's newest Mexican delight. Though I am a strict El Campesena guy when it comes to Mexican in the area, I am starting to veer towards Rey's. I mean this is crazy for a kid that LOVES El Camp, especially after only ONE visit to Rey's. 

I don't if it's my selfishness, that I don't like new places or environments, but the new El Camp is missing something that it had at the old Pappin's. So after only one visit I am willing to brake my loyalty to El Camp and give Rey's a run.

My recommendations at this joint are very rough & limited. But the sauce on there Enchiladas is fantastic. Don't know if that's what there calling there mole, but it's rich in smokeyness. This must mean there is Adobo sauce involved which is NEVER a bad thing. The right amount of heat so no hot sauce is needed (well, for me).

The chips and salsa aren't even close to the quality of El Camp. Though I do like a thicker chip, these were just bland. The salsa is very jar tasting to this jedi.

My meal made up for more than what they offered in chip & salsa department. So I have to give it Rey's for stepping into the ring with other Mexican restaurants in the area.

Jedi Recommendations;

* Enchilada
* Burrito 
* Taco (WAY better than El Camp)"
Positive	Great atmosphere especially when the weather isn't too hot. Every time we've been here the service is on point. Great for families too as there is a ton of open space for kids to run. Good food too!
Positive	"My first time here I probably spent an hour sniffing samples and making my selection.  I use their products daily. With any of the herb mixtures, and a piece of meat, you can produce a gourmet meal. I also like the Greek seasoning, Fox Point Seasoning & Garden Salad seasoning, sprinkled on my salad and drizzled with olive oil. My kids have to have the Pizza seasoning on a frozen pizza. I use the Sandwich Sprinkle on my homemade tortilla wraps. The Red & Green Bell Pepper flakes are great in casseroles. 
I did learn one thing from Penzey's- in the past, I used too little of the dried herbs per pound of meat.
If your little ones aren't in a stroller-beware, there's a lot they could get into."
Positive	i love this buffet.  ive never paid to go to the wynn or bellagio and probably never will.  ive tried planet hollywoods, luxors, mgm, harrahs, and flamingo and this is the only one ive repeated numerous times.  i usually only enjoy going to buffets during the champagne brunches on the weekend so i can get crab legs and unlimited champagne.  we came here on saturday after checking out of mandalay bay because mandalay did not have crab legs on saturday.  so we went to our old reliable buffet at monte carlo.  it was about a ten minute wait at noon.  i love this brunch.  love the crab legs ate 2 plates worth of those.  sat there for about an hour and a half had a ridiculous amount of champagne.  for a couple years now its pretty much the same buffet on the brunch weekend, which i like.  they have the best fried chicken ever.  i love it so much, and wish i had the recipe for it.  for $19.95 I feel it is the best value buffet.   The wait staff was a bit slow in taking plates but our waitress more than made up for it, as she seemed to give us extra attention because she seemed to like that we weren't being rude to her like other tables.  i don't feel like its fancy food, but i thoroughly enjoy it.   i dont expect as much out of buffets as i feel others do.  if you're a picky eater i dont think going to a buffet is a good idea in the first place.  but this one is always enjoyable and well worth the money on the weekends for brunch.
Positive	Went to Vegas for a mini vacation and came back with a Leopard Gecko and a red Iguana.  Customer service was great and we are very happy with our new babies.
Positive	From my very first consultation with Ben & Kelly to the incredible engagement photos they took, they two of them in my opinion are the best. The engagement photo shoot that they did for my husband and I truly set the stage for our wedding day. The two of them work tirelessly to capture the perfect shot and their work ethic far exceeds any other photographers I have ever worked with. Working with them felt like a day of hanging out with friends. They put my husband and I at ease and we know that we have found our life long photographers.
Positive	"My all time favorite ayce kbbq in Vegas.  More selections of meats than nearby BBQ spots, also prices here are much more reasonable compared to other places especially with the options they do give you. 

Servers are always helpful and willing to guide you and assist you through the menu.  Service isn't always up to par depending on the time of day you are dining in.  Again, this is Asian dining in friggin Chinatown and not a Michelin restaurant; you guys complaining about service and cleanliness has got to get a grip and take your pretension else where.  Eat the damn food and enjoy. 

Getting a table after 5 pm, good luck.  Always a wait for the minimal seating, so choose your time in meeting friends and family wisely. After 10pm is always great and so are lunch hours."
Positive	"Not bad...

Next to Dairy Queen, and hot dog on a stick is metro graden. Feeling sluggish already, i knew that if i had a heavy lunch from.....well, anywhere in the food court, i would probably be in a coma.

Not being a salad ""person"", i was a little afraid. Salads that are usually dry, and have no flavor...or the lettuce isnt crunchy. You get the idea.

I ordered a caeser salad wrap ($6) and added chicekn (+$2.75). They have a few different tortilla options,  i asked for spinach. 

After a drink, it came to about $10. Pretty pricey, but it is the mall. 

Honestly,  i was impressed with how well the wrap tasted. Everything was crisp, and fresh. Just enough dressing, thankfully, because the chicken was kind of dry. 

The only thing that sucked is the package. The big plastic container that comes along with the wrap, and my wrap wasnt cut, either.... so, as i pick up the entire wrap, the container just falls over, and out comes my silverware. Having half of a 2rap weigh it down would have been great.


Also, it wasnt ""wrapped"" that well.... maby things came piling out when i went to eat it, making it pretty messy."
Positive	I love Sprinly meals and I love their owners because of their amazing customer service. They are super responsive, willing to adjust to your needs and wants and I have never been disappointed with a meal. Portions are just right for us and the variety of meals and ingredients is very good. Their prices are pretty comparable with other plant based delivered meals I have been researching, but unfortunately, it is still more expensive than cooking yourself at home (which is to be expected). We don't use them every week but I am planning on using them when I have lot going on and cannot cook at home every night. Their plans are very flexible so I can order for a week, hold for a week or cancel anytime. Strongly recommend them!
Positive	When I first entered the salon, i love the atmosphere and the decor. It looked so clean and so contemporary. I had my haircut and I had my hair styled by Keri. She was such a sweet person and she did a really good job on my hair. I told her how i wanted it done and she fulfilled it.  There was another young lady named Andie and she was very helpful too and friendly. I feel that I got a five star service.
Positive	"I sent my wife in first on a recon mission: yes they have an ""A"" sanitation rating, yes, they have tables and yes, they take credits cards. It's a small place with two flat screens playing spanish language tv (telenovellas). Our waitress was bubbly and had some good recommendations. My favorites were the tacos (one with Puerco al pastor and one with chorizo) both on homemade tortillas. The next best were the Huaraches. Basically a flat bread with the meat of your choice (mine was chorizo) covered in lettuce, cheese and sour cream. Delicious!! They have Mexican Coke and Jarritos (Toronja = grapefruit is the best!!!). Great little hole in the wall place for good tacos if you're passing through Gastonia."
Positive	"Man did I get a day of service in this place. I had a few drinks and needed some relaxation! I went in and was like ""I'll have the menu please"" 

I got a massage, manicure, foot rub... I was drooling when it was over. The facility isn't a 5 star spa, but it works well enough. I think the services are reasonably priced."
Positive	"Carbs are my best friend. This cafe is a wonderful idea, owned by a Korean couple they offer everything you imaginable wedged in between a waffle. Waffle pizza, waffle sandwich... 
I didn't get to try those just yet.. 
I had the pumpkin waffle with bananas, whip cream, and nuts. It was delicious. The waffle was cooked a tad bit too much, but I hold no grudges. 

Great place for a meal any time of the day. 
The menu is fun and varied...I bet they will concoct any combination if you just ask. That's 4 stars in my eyes."
Positive	This has to be the best sushi I have ever had. Was in town for meetings and looked up Sushi restaurants on Yelp and this was #1 in ratings. I can see why. Absolutely everything we had was incredible! Lots of different choices from the usual. Pork Belly? Sooooo good! Will be back here for sure!
Positive	"This was a wonderful adventure. 
The owners were so kind and welcoming, real Russian hospitality. I went there with a small group of friends, we each tried something different and shared...it was all delicious and we ate it all with absolute joy.
The fish was great, so we're the meatballs and the cabbage roll was super.
For a beverage we had Kvass. It was divine. My friends had never had it and were instantly hooked.
I am so happy to have found this place. Will for sure go back and bring other folks to try this home made style food."
Positive	"My husband and I were sitting at the bar last Sat just celebrating our anniversary with a cpl drinks ...Alex the bartender had asked my husband while I had stepped away ..how many years?...he replied 50...congratulated us..we continued talking, had another drink and shared appetizers....when we went to pay the check..unbeknownst to us ..they.. Capitol Grille.picked up difference from our card...we were totally blown away by this unexpected generosity. .u should also know the calamari was delightful..light and crispy and the shrimp were phenomenonal.. ..we are very thankful and have shared this story with so many of our friends and famly...looking forward to going back soon and having sea bass /steak...also Greg , the Manager and the other bartender whose name escapes us were so complimentary to ur restaurant.. Thank u very much  again
Sincerely
Doug and Jean Dustin"
Positive	"Great nail salon. Quality work and clean facility. I'm a regular and see Peter religiously every 2 weeks. He's the best!  But, all the gals do equally awesome work. 

The salon is busy, so make an appointment at least two weeks (especially for Peter) in advance if you can."
Positive	"Wow!  So tasty!  Had the jerk chicken and pork.  It is spicy, moist, and just straight up amazing.  The jerk chicken is boneless which is nice.  

Friendly staff.  This place is tucked away in a small plaza so it is definitely a hidden gem.  There is a small sitting area, but this is more of a take-out place.  

I have to go back and try the ox-tail next time."
Positive	Just found this place. Ordered the chicken kabobs with humus and pita and a Greek salad. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, fully cooked and moist. Not over cooked and dried out. The salad fresh and crunchy. Most of all the humus, light and delicate. I've only had it like this when it was homemade. Fantastic!
Positive	"The hand pulled noodles are as good as you can imagine and the beef broth they come in is so delicious and satisfying, I really wouldn't let anyone add any chilli oil until tasted pure. It's on the table anyway, and I just added a little or a lot to my spoon, so it wouldn't taint the beautiful broth. 
I also had spicy cucumbers on the side, which are amazing. They are fresh and crisp and have that slight mouth numbing sensation from Sichuan pepper, but in a totally good way."
Positive	I just want to say how fantastic everything I have ordered from Pizza Salerno has been! From their pizza to their wings, I have never been disappointed. I have only had  one small problem in years, and management took care of immediately! Their delivery time is much shorter than any local pizza shop also which is an added bonus. I highly recommend them and I do not usually review anyone good or bad. Keep up the good work Pizza Salerno!!
Positive	"I'm a fan.

I've been there perhaps 10 times?  Never had a bad dinner.

Always with great service, consistent food quality.

One criticism would be that their menu is pretty...ehh...unchanging.

I think it's almost the same stuff all the time.  It does get a little old and although having your staples menu is good, it needs change."
Positive	"Quite honestly the best restaurant experience I've had in a looong time. EVERYTHING about our night was absolutely perfect! I'll start by saying that Pittsburgh's food scene has been exploding as of late with lots of new trendy spots popping up in hipster neighborhoods around town. But Monterey Bay has been a standard in the Burgh for a long time, and I feel like it's only gotten better. Some of the restaurants on Mt. Washington coast by on the views, but that's not the case here!

The views are excellent of course, and the decor is contemporary but still inviting. I think the last time I was here they had a tropical theme going on, but the remodeled interior is beautiful.

We had the ceviche appetizer - I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. It was light and refreshing, and we could tell that the kanpachi was fresh. I had the crab cake and scallops as my entree. The scallops were simply prepared but SO good. If you come here you need to experience a crab cake! They use practically no filler at all. Just enough to keep it together. They are also broiled instead of fried. I honestly don't know if i would ever order anything else here! 

My fiancé went with the shrimp tagliatelle which was also fabulous. The sauce was delicious and the tagliatelle noodles were cooked perfectly. We were surprised that the pasta dish was so delicious! For dessert we went with the angel food grilled cheese and the hype is real - it's amazing. The portion size was quite large so I think this is perfect to share. I love dessert and this is one of my favorites.

The service was just excellent. Jane our server was so friendly and knowledgeable and the manager stopped by to check on us as well. I can't wait to come back!!"
Positive	This is a great place. Tons of character - from the Tiger-themed everything to the tinsel and Xmas lights that look like they're from the 1960s (can't remember how much of that is just for the holidays). It's in a divey little strip mall but it feels a bit classier than your typical dive. I've always been happy with their mixed drinks - last time we were there we had some perfectly made martinis. The bartenders are always in white button down shirts and ties and always seem personable. This place is perfect if you've been running around shopping at West Towne Mall, Home Depot, or elsewhere and you just want to slide into a nice dark bar and chill out with a cocktail before heading back out into the fray.
Positive	"Service: Excellent
Food: First Class
Price: Expensive
Atmosphere: A Great Break from the action on the strip

Lunch meeting, 3 hours long! We had a great time, great service, great food, the seafood bento box was to die for. Freshest seafood on the strip!

If you want a little bit of a break from all the action this is a must stop."
Positive	Their boba is perfect for me only because it was chewy, and I hate soft boba. I got their jasmine milk tea and it had a strong tea taste not the generic type of flavor.
Positive	"A DEFINITE MUST IF YOU ARE PLANNING A WEDDING! This wedding expo is AMAZING! This past weekend, I went with my sister in law to find vendors for her wedding. It was our second time attending, and both times were awesome. SO many vendors to choose from, we were truly blown away both times. She found every vendor  she is going to use from this expo. We had such a blast! She ended up finding her dress also, which was so exciting. The whole back of the convention center is filled with dresses, and a huge area to try on. So many gorgeous dresses to choose from that are in perfect condition and hugely discounted. You can buy jewelry and accessories also. We saw a bunch of girls walk out with dresses/bridesmaid dresses. 

The booths and vendors that participate have awesome displays, you can get ideas for centerpieces, colors, tables decoration, cakes, DJ set-ups, candy bars, flower arrangements, photography, venue décor - literally anything you could think of is there to see. Vender's bring food to try, bakeries bring cakes and samples, there are photo-booths, and pretty much every booth has a raffle for some sort... giving away honeymoon packages, photography sessions, make-up applications, flower arrangements, candy bar set-ups, you name it, they have it, and you get a chance to win it. My sister in law has already won a free photography session and a discounted honeymoon package. She brought stickers with her name, phone number, and e-mail on it for all of the raffles, it made everything so much easier for her since you collect so much stuff.  

The fashion show was also so much fun. This is seriously the best place to go if you are planning a wedding, or know someone who is. Everyone is excited to be there, and it shows how many vendors and different directions you can go with planning your big day. We had the mother of the bride, mother of the groom, and all the girls in the wedding party attend and we seriously had the best time. They have multiple bars and places to get food, it's a perfect opportunity to get the girls together and make an all day thing out of it. There were also A LOT of guys there, and people brought their kids. They have stuff for everyone, not just brides. It starts at 9:00 am and goes until 3:00 pm, it will take you all day to see everything and it's so worth it! 

We can't wait to go again in January!"
Positive	"Let's start with what Viking Lanes ""isn't"" and get that out of the way. It isn't a Michelin star restaurant, it isn't a Professional Bowlers Association tour stop and it isn't a Hyatt. It isn't an example of perfect janitorial standards, isn't an establishment that routinely updates the interior and isn't a place you probably want to be around within an hour of ""Last Call"". 

Now, let's dive into what Viking Lanes is. Viking Lanes is a SOLID local bowling and entertainment spot that offers really good (and good prices) food, great drinks (and great drink prices), great bowling, great birthday parties for kids and a great venue to watch any of the Wisconsin sports games (which normally include some really, really good food and drink specials). 

It's a great place to take the family (don't let my first paragraph concern you - this is a fantastic place that is really family friendly). The staff here go above and beyond to make sure that all customers, regardless of age, are taken care of and comfortable. 

It really is a gem in the City that is often overlooked for food and fun. Give Viking Lanes a chance and I'm pretty sure you'll be happy you did!"
Positive	We liked this place. Service was great on Black Friday morning. Food came in a timely manner and the coffee was decent. Get the potatoes extra crispy. Kids liked the French toast. I got the sausage Benedict and while it was well prepared, didn't care for the sausage patty flavor it was more like simple ground pork party than sausage. Otherwise we would come back.
Positive	My boyfriend and I did the 2 for $40 deal, where you get two salads, two entrees and a bottle of wine for 40 bucks.  The food was decent, not sure it was worth the regular prices though.  The service was also a bit slow. We did sit on the patio which is beautiful! Overall a nice place.
Positive	"I was in Charlotte for an interview and noticed I had a run in my pantyhose!  I searched for the nearest mall and ended up in this fancy schmancy place!  Like some reviewers have said, this is the ""Rich Mall"" that every city has.  Not the place you go for bargins, but where you want to feel fabulous.  I hope I get the job, because I would love to see this place at Christmas time."
Positive	"I've had my SASs for nearly three years.  I stopped here to buy new insoles. Standard insoles are $22 but I went for the Step Plus ""foot bed"" made of Everbounce cushioning for $39 a pair!  Advanced arch and metatarsal* support!

With these inserts I should be able to milk another year outta my SASs. Even well-worn SASs are better than cheap new crap from Singapore or wherever.

The friendly associate was kind enough to look up my shoe size for the proper fit. I sure hope my new insert wasn't made in China.  I scoured the package but found no evidence of the item's place of manufacture.

I don't trust companies to be forthright about where their products are made. SAS products are known to be American made.  I try to buy American made products. Unlike multinational corporations and their marionettes in Congress, I want my fellow Americans to have jobs.

Trying to make friendly conversation, Lucinda asked ""So what do you do all day when it's not busy.""

The lady seemed slightly offended. A little defensively, she replied that she has more than enough to do. She may have thought Lucinda was implying she was a lazy goof off.  Lucinda only asked because the store was absolutely deserted both times we visited, the first being for the initial purchase. Lucinda only wondered what she did to combat boredom.

Next question was a little touchy too:  How long should a pair of SASs last?  You should replace 'em every 6-8 months, she said.  When I revealed I'd had mine for THREE YEARS, she was not happy.  ""Oh that's WAY too long,"" she said.  Maybe she was thinking ""It's people like you who take food outta my mouth!""

My pair cost $200.  By now I've gotten more than my money's worth. Co-workers are aghast when I mention the price. No way are they gonna spend that kind of money.  

Good luck finding cheap crap that will last even one year and still be comfortable.

I want the SAS store to be busy.  Casino & hospital workers who are on their feet all day should flock to this place.

Here's a tip:  Those old insoles are not worn out!  I put my old pair in my crappy Big 5 sneakers and brought 'em back to life.

*As a service to Yelpers who can't be troubled to look up unfamiliar words, ""metatarsal"" refers to ""a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes.""  (WikiPedia)"
Positive	Very nice. Beautifully equipped but the TV Chanel selection was terrible and frankly annoying for such an expensive hotel. Most of the channels weren't even HD and there were no premium channels. I get that we are all supposed to be out on the town having fun but sometimes you just want to relax in your room an watch TV, but at the Palazzo that is not really an option. Otherwise very nice.
Negative	The meat was ok, but there were no really all you can it because after the first set of meat pieces I have to ask for every little bit. We ask for the wifi password but no one could answer our question, because of this we shorten the tip but the waiter came to claim more :-( very unkind!
Negative	Since my first review I have eaten here twice and sadly didn't like the after affects. Both visits left me and my party feeling very ill. We all had diarrhea after. *sorry for the graphic details.. :( Disappointment since I really liked it the first time. I love their bakery selection, but being sick twice in a row mean something weird is up. Yes it has have great reviews and awards, but I don't like feeling sick after eating dinner.. :(
Negative	I was in this shop on 11/10/17, around 12:00pm.  I came in there was a couple in front of me placing their order I was next a line was then forming behind me the couple ordered and I was standing  there waiting to order, after a few minutes the clerk ask me my order I gave it to him and stepped to the side.  I stood there ad I watched about ten people that were behind me order and receive their food and I was still standing there.  After about 20min the same clerk ask me what did I order, at this point I am very angry.. I don't want to call racism but being the only person of color in the shop it sure has that component,  he then gave me the wrong guy order and had to make the order again after about 48mins I got my sandwich, as I stated to walk out the couple that was in front of me had finished their lunch and said to me what happened  you were right behind us, that was not right for them to treat you like that, I said I said yeah I know in 2017 right.
Negative	"I had an issue with my account using black card facilities. I didn't find out until I came into the location on 1/17/17. My tanning bed options were not allowed. The night guy said that managers at two locations saw me letting others tan. This was a lie since I only go to the 1020 N 54th St, Chandler location; I have been to out of state locations in the past, but not in 2016. When I called back during the daytime hours to speak with the manager Mike about it, he refused to speak with me. Only Tasia would speak with me. Tasia said someone had contacted me on 12/16/16 about this, but this was not accurate; no one had called or talked to me about this. I had been in using all the facilities at the location right up present time. 
Current management at this location leaves much to be desired. I have been a member for 2 years."
Negative	We paid these guys for a screen door, window screen and ordered a new lock for one of our windows. We paid over $300 by check. We did not receive a receipt. The owner, Jeff Sarra, told us a story of how our items were left on a job site and he had to re order. It has been 3 weeks since then and now he will not answer the phone when we call and does not return our calls. We'll have to pursue other actions to get a refund.
Negative	The owner of this service is a racist and misogynist internet troll who regularly posts racist comments about african Americans and will call women all kinds of filthy, lewd, and crude names. I would think twice before letting this man on to your property as he seems hostile and unhinged, judging by the disgusting statements he has made on social media.
Negative	"Our first visit tonight, a Friday, and soooo not impressed.  Very loud, tight quarters.  Probably didn't help that we had a table in the corner by the back door with lots of kids running around.  

Our ""small"" pizza for two took 40 minutes to arrive, and we purposely ordered quickly before several big parties were seated.  The pizza was extremely thin and the sauce was sweet.  We ordered ham as one of our 4 ingredients and it was ""diced.""  I have never seen diced ham on a pizza, only in omelets.  It kept rolling off the pizza and not much cheese to hold it onto the crust.  We also ordered a mediterrean salad and it was ok.  Prices were reasonable, thus great for families. 

Won't be going back anytime soon to this pizzeria that reminded me of one grade above a Chuckie Cheese w/o the games."
Negative	"Avoid this place, the food was terrible the only thing that was good were the jalapeño poppers. 
The bbq chicken was very dry and didn't have any BBQ sauce AT ALL. 
The buffalo wings did not taste like buffalo and the drink were the worst, the mojito tasted like rubbing alcohol & my margarita tasted like tequila mixed with water. So bad I had to return it. 
Our server was nice though"
Negative	"Really is buyer beware!  While looking at Samsonite's feather light models, I was perplexed to see one at a good deal, then saw a similar size, same brand but $250 more.

Difference?  one made in Europe lol.  and comes with a lifetime warranty.

But the downgrade really is their no refund policy ,exchange only within 14 days."
Negative	I have been working for large chemical manufacturers, in sales, for over 20 years, and I have never experienced a lack of professionalism and customer service. I went to the site for an eye exam and got new eyeglasses. The issue came when I returned the glasses after wearing them for a week to have them to readjust the lenses as the pupil dimensions were in correct.  This error caused what is called prism vision, the text letters would appear with a shadow or like double vision. This error was verified by an independent optician.  After dropping off my glasses to get the lenses corrected I received a call from their office about 2 hours later.  I was told they wouldn't send the lenses to the lab to be corrected and I would need to come back to pick up the glasses and they would refund only the lenses or $225. I called my insurance, VSP, to get a fair resolution. In returning to their office,  I had to demand that the insurance claim for the lenses be reversed. Apparently, they were happy to take my money but were not going to stand by their product.  Providing the exam and taking the correct measurements is their business, not my.  Wow, in over 20 years in business I have never experienced this type of poor service. Yet, I have read where people or businesses have swindle individuals to get the money.  Good luck to all who go to Precision Eyecare.
Negative	"Spent thousands of dollars less than two years ago for a custom gateway.  Multiple service calls to repair something that barely sees any use, but with the most recent one, we were told it would be $225 per hour to fix their work. 

The gate does shut or lock. Poor quality work and worse customer service."
Negative	"I've let shiny things take my money and then leave me with nothing but regret enough times to know better (see: arcade claw machine, trophy wife, etc.) 

This is another trap. Don't look at the fancy conveyor belt, just run."
Negative	"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Inedible, inferior quality, unacceptable. 

I bought a ton of meat from this company which totaled over $250, all of which I can't even feed my dog. Poor quality, flavorless, questionable texture and definitely reminiscent of the ""mystery meat"" you grew up with your your school cafeteria. 

We have tried every application we can possibly think of to make this meat somewhat edible and have not had any luck, both the ""beef"" and the ""chicken"" ended up in the trash. A total loss."
Negative	"I set up a consult with Janelle, not very friendly or personable but I didn't think anything of it. We had our consult and agreed on a design and appointment and that was that. About 5 days before my appointment I get an email with a barrage of questions - literally everything we went over in the consult. Was she not listening? Did she forget because she didn't take any notes? Either way, unprofessional, but I replied within a couple hours explaining everything in very explicit detail. Didn't hear back for a couple days...emailed again seeing if our appointment was still confirmed...nothing. Emailed one more time, left a voicemail with the store and a direct message on Janelle's instagram. FINALLY heard back the NIGHT before my appointment that I was being unprofessional contacting her on her day off and that she typically doesn't confirm her appointments because that's what the hefty deposit is for. I held up my end of the deal, but she wasn't doing her part. Long story short, Janelle cancelled my appointment and refunded my deposit because I was simply trying to get in touch with her during her ""busy schedule"". Not sure what's more important that her paying clients that are trying to get in touch with her, but it must be pretty damn important. Not sure how her tattoo skills are because I never got to witness them, but if she's this stuck up I bet she's pretty good. If you have the patience to deal with her attitude and untimely customer service, be my guest. Maybe you'll have better luck that I did (:"
Negative	This review is only on one plate of food I had here. Wild boar sausage sounds good on menu but is flavorless and dry. On top of it, it costs $10. Not worth it. However love the ambiance and would come here for beers and go watch the game and our server was sweet and helpful!
Negative	The sorry wannabe ID guy at the door is unprofessional and a d**k. He charges whomever he wants even if you can prove you've already paid. I guess he needs the money to fix that hair cut. Shaved sides & long on top, so last season.
Negative	I visited this place a few months apart first time I went the donkey had a open wound I went back just last weekend and 2 months later still had a wound but bigger! There were rotting pumpkins all over the place and one horse had a mask with flies swirling around his head and face. I seen staff washing and walking the miniature horses one of the staff members was riding on the miniatures horse which was surprising because the horse should have been riding him considering he was too big to be riding the poor horse. It's a cute place but it's a Hoarders dream. This place needs improvement especially their care of animals if you can't care for them than you shouldn't have them. Period ! I've peen to Bonnie Springs Zoo and that place is immaculate as can be for a zoo and the animals are well cared for. McKee Ranch needs to step it up and care for these animals the way they deserve !
Negative	"My girlfriend took her car here asking for her AC to be topped off, we knew there was a leak but only wanted a recharge. We got a couple quotes for this service for around $80. She looked this place up and found a coupon and was hoping to save $10-20 on the job. When she called ahead of time and when dropping off she said she had no interest in repairing the leak. When she picked up the car she was charged almost $190.

I called the next day and spoke with the service writer who says my girlfriend did request a full diagnostic service and implied that's what she was charged for. Then she put on someone named Kathy who my girlfriend had spoken to before bringing the car in who then proceeded to tell me that $190 is the standard price for the freon top off!

In the best case this is a failure of their staff to discover what their customers needs are and keep them informed about costs and expectations. In the worst case I was given the run around with conflicting/incorrect information. Or both. Either way, I would  never recommend this shop to someone"
Negative	While the pizza is good the service and cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.   A couple months ago I went in at 11am - opening time.  Most tables and the floor was dirty.  Staff was very distant and didn't seem to care if anything was clean or they were there to help people.  I forgot about this incident and went back again on Thurs 10/25 as I had a coupon.  Again - I was there at 11.  Tables were visibly dirty again.  Not just soda rings but actual food.  The floor was dirty as well.  Staff again didn't seem to care that we were there to order food.  This will be the last time I go to this location.   I don't know if I will be willing to try another location or not.  Blaze Pizza is a block away from Pizza Rev.  They are good.
Negative	"Macarons.  I had been buying them several times in a sleeve from the refrigerator with typically about 5 different flavors. The last occasion my sleeve broke!  all of the macarons fell to the asphalt, shortly after exiting the store. I returned to the store and they were closed. I then returned about a month later to let them know what had happened hoping that they might replace my rather costly baked goods. Supported by photographs ~I explained with them my disappointment. I was told buy a cashier that I would be given 25% off of a replacement...whaa? I've then emailed the owner and  he asked me if I had a receipt? Whaaa? A receipt was not offered to me and certainly the $2 tip that I left for the young man who sold them to me would not have been included. It was not a business expense lol --- I did not insist on a receipt! Remember I have pictures with the macarons on the ground and the sleeve in the foreground. 
 I have bought a number of these sleeves & had a dry hard chocolate cookie that wasn't the quality of the others..twice. I still have sent repeat business to these guys and overlooked the random dry cookie here and there. I'm a bit of a connoisseur of macarons and had been purchasing them in Chicago for a number of years. At 2 bucks a piece per cookie - retaining a client and getting continued referrals for those and other offerings I have tried,  you would think that they would care enough to replace my cookies and reinforce their bags."
Negative	This company has so many bad reviews on and off the Internet! My friend went thru hell trying to get a house using All Western Mortgage. It was either having to keep resending same papers over and over or simply just given the run around on the phone all the time. Definitely a no -no in my book and I will spread the word!
Negative	We went last night (10/27/18). Should have figured it out when we went in. 6:00 pm and no wait.  After sitting for over 10 minutes. Our waitress showed up. We ordered.  Waitress was nice.  Brought out drinks and salads.  My salad was so wilted and brown and old. I was dumbfounded how someone could bring it to your table. When she walked by. I gave it back to her and so did my friend who was with me. Entree came. It tasted good. But I was afraid to eat it after the salad. We should have gone to Bonefish.  We will not go back there.
Negative	"I will not delete this review until I get the money back. I did call the ERRF and it has been maybe 4 months. What bothers me is the fact that my lease ended at the end on August 2016 and this ""stolen funds case"" maybe started in the beginning of May or June of 2016. Real property didn't even send out a courtesy letter stating that this was happening and at least wave my last mo rent...I'm a good person to lease to. I paid my rent on time for 3 1/2 years, And when I vacated the place I lived at for many years, I left it clean with nothing broken. I don't care who or what company (name) stole the funds. All I know is I sent all my checks or payments to ""Real property Management . "" there was no mistake or problem when the payments were sent to that company's name right?!!...."
Negative	I realize why people are using Uber and Lift after calling Royal Cab company. When I called the first time, I was told someone would be there in 10-15 minutes. When I called the second time, they didn't have any of my information and said it would be 10-15 minutes. When I called the third time, someone else said the same thing. When I brought it to her attention, she hung up on me. She was extremely unprofessional! Use City Cab if you need a taxi.
Negative	"The first time I went here, was just after it opened. I guess people hadnt figured out it existed yet and thus, food came quick enough, and although they got my order wrong I couldnt complain because it was good nevertheless. 
The second time...upon enterring, the claustrophobia kicked in. Too many groups of unattended people all chilling by the door and it took 15 minutes just for someone to acknowledge me. Then, after specifically requesting not to be seated at the bar (eating within elbow touching distance of strangers? No thank you!) I was hustled to the bar 5 minutes later. 
After waiting OVER AN HOUR (for instant noodles, mind you....this should never ever take this long), I finally lost all patience and got up and left. Refund was not offered. 

All in all, unless youre with a group of friends who have a hell of a lot to talk about and think just-okay instant noodles are worth an hour plus wait, avoid this place."
Negative	"I was walking in Old Town, waiting for my hair appointment later in the afternoon. I was looking for the Mandala Tea Room but found the Picnic Company first. There were about 10 police motorcycles out front and I figured they knew what was up food wise in the area. 

I felt rushed from the second I walked in the door. The employees looked like they were in a hurry and I felt pressured to order fast. I quickly glanced at the menu, not wanting to get a sandwich, I decided on the Sedona Salad for $6.50. 

The salad was slapped down on the pick-up counter, and when I got up there, it was the most unappealing, thrown together mess I've ever seen at any establishment that calls itself a restaurant. First, it was extremely small. Second, the spinach, feta, nuts, and red onions were all just thrown on there as though it went through some fast food assembly line.The vinaigrette tasted bottled. I could have made a more presentable salad that tasted better with produce from Fry's, that cost me less than a dollar. 

Who knows how their sandwiches are. I'm sure they're decent considering all the cops in there. I won't be back to find out. 

I was so hungry after eating this sorry excuse for a salad, I walked over to the Mandala Tea Room and ate another meal. ugh."
Negative	Their food was palatable. Their service, terrible. I will not be back. The lady was not courteous on my last visit, so I left before I even ordered and found a better spot on spring mountain and ft apache.(ny style Chinese food) The quality there is much better I'm glad I was upset enough to seek out a new spot.
Negative	Not good!  Walked in around 930 pm and the place was a hot mess. From the floors to the bathroom to the dirty and unkept area behind the counter, I should have taken the clue. My blizzard came and it looked runny. It even tasted strange and rotten. Within an hour I was pretty sick. Never had a bad ice cream experience before this one. Really disappointing
Negative	Me and my husband went into the Vig on saturday June 3 at 1:40pm. We were immediately seated outside and given our waters right away. From there we waited 25 minutes and were never serviced. Our server never acknowledged us, never asked us if we wanted drinks, and never took our order. She came out several times and took orders of people who came in after us. We ended up just leaving, and as we were walking out no one said anything. There were only 4 other groups on the patio outside. I'm not sure why we were never serviced but I just thought the owner or manager should we aware.
Negative	I stayed here for a work trip in June 2015. I have stayed in about 10 other hotels in Vegas and this place is the worst. The people at the front desk were rude and I had clothing taken out of my room by the maid staff. It has been two months and this problem has not been taken care of. I have been calling for over 3 weeks and finally heard something back today that I must deal with the claims department. Would have been great for you to call me back 3 weeks ago to tell me that. The women I spoke to kept speaking over me and would not let me speak. She was rude, everyone there is rude and the hotel is gross.
Negative	"from a morality perspective, I can't return - the owner verbally and physically abused his staff (I think it was his wife who is the dumpling cook) in front of everybody - people were saying that they would never return and I am doing the same!!! very disturbing. the ""owner"" said he didn't care about opinion when customers confronted him... yelling, making a scene... the guy is flat out dumb - shot him self in the foot big time!!! what an idiot. I feel sorry for the staff -- but DON""T GO!!!"
Negative	"I  would give them no stars but it's not an option.  called their ""vp of business development"" and if this is their idea of business development i don't really know what to say.  absolutely the most rude person ever.  your a landscape company...i don't expect sugar and cream but for goodness sake when i try to tell you that you were referred maybe you should at least try to be receptive to the call and to the client who referred you.  instead you made them look like they are nuts for referring you and you were rude enough to make me actually get on yelp to post about how miserable an experience the phone call with you was.  way to go business development vince.  your absolutely top of the food chain when it comes to losing business. nice quick hangup gets 5 stars though."
Negative	"Went last night- as soon as you opened the doors there was a sign that said ""no beer, no wine"", ""no chicken, no veal"", ""cash only, terminal down"", didn't matter as we were there for pizza. Ordered our pizza only to find out that they also ran out of gluten free crust. Okay, ordered pasta that was gluten free. When the pasta came they gave me the spicy sauce which was too violent for my taste buds so I sent it back. As there is an open concept kitchen, I saw the chef reusing the ingredients in my sauce as they didn't have anymore sausages. I'm thinking that this place is in receivership as they had very limited ingredients on hand, it all makes sense. I am going to be reporting this place to York Region as I saw way too many instances of cross contamination tonight. Stay away!!"
Negative	"This was so bad... I ran in to the house to write this review! We went to the restaurant because of a promotion they were running for the High School .... NEVER AGAIN! 
I ordered the wings, which were okay. Not great. My wife ordered the burger, well done... it came to the table red. My other daughter ordered wings with Pub Chips. The wings were okay, but the pub chips were soggy and underdone. 
We would have pointed this out to the waitress... HAD WE SEEN HER! She came by a couple of times and I tried to get her attention, but she obviously was not terribly interested in checking on us. No drink refills... no checking with us. My wife asked to have the Burger removed from the check when we finally did catch her, since we were all done eating. She was less than personable after we requested the burger be removed. 
I can only assume that the people in this very trendy neighborhood simply don't want to leave the neighborhood to eat... I can't believe they are going to have a long term future given the food and service."
Negative	This review won't help you one bit with the food at this establishment, since I never got to eat here. I was seated at a table, and waited upwards of twenty minutes for a server to just acknowledge me. Another table was seated after me, and got attention immediately. When I saw that a server wasn't going to come over, I got up and left. Poor service is usually indicative of bad food, but you will need to judge for yourself, if you actually make past just looking at the menu. Epic fail!
Negative	Management has changed and it shows and not in a good way.  We were there for 4 hours and should have been out in 2.5.  The service is horrendous - aside from being slow, they are not the friendliest folks in the world.  Instead of having 2-3 hostesses sitting at the front desk twiddling their thumbs, put them to work and have them refill waters and clear tables because the wait staff and bus boys can't maintain the level of service there once was.  The food is sub-par - I had to return the Carpaccio because it was truly disgusting.  We had 6 people in our group and there were 3-4 separate checks for the group.  Why are they adding 20% gratuity on each of the checks for a party of 6.  Unreal and uncalled for.  The ceiling needs work - there are huge open vents with freezing cold air blowing through them.  Hope they can get their act together, or they will lose their client base.
Negative	Me and my family had dinner here. our waitress Sara was so unprofessional she did not write down our orders which cause her not to remember what we order instead of take our order right for the second time she stood at our table and told us all her personal business and issue she and then we over heard her at another table tell the girls there how she had quit her other job and wanted to get them shut down needless to say we got our food to go and she brought the check and we paid she proceeded to walk away then she turns around and say hey I think you for got to give me a tip at that moment I was mad so I asked for the manager she refused to get them this lady really need to be fired she was so unprofessional me or my family will not come back to this place we had a bad experience
Negative	"Brought my friend in who has a very bad gluten allergy to wheat.  He wanted to try a burger wrapped in romaine lettuce.  YOU REFUSED TO DO A SIMPLE THING AS WRAP A BURGER IN ROMAINE?  You add bread crumbs to your meat patties and bread your french frys in wheat breading?  

Walked out because of your unwillingness to bring one piece of romaine lettuce on the side. Drop the attitude - it's not pretty."
Negative	I was sitting there over an hour. The hostess, who has the worse sense of customer service, keeps saying 20mins and then she just didn't seem to know anything. This has been a complete waste of my time. I decided to just go up the street to Olive Garden.
Negative	Just not fresh tuna or scallops. &Burnt salmon skin. Wilted lettuce. Even rice wasn't Japanese.. I did like the seaweed salad though. I just got take out but the service was very nice so I'm giving it a 2 stars for the ambience and how close it is. Even though I did pay $7 for an uber.
Negative	I've been looking for a decent Chinese food place since moving to the area almost 4 years ago. Tried this place for the first time and I was disappointed. My sweet and sour chicken was undercooked with practically raw batter under the initially fried outsides. The fried rice was average, no veggies and hardly any egg. Sweet and sour sauce tasted bland, it was nothing special. Same with the won ton soup - had high hopes and it tastes almost like nothing. Just plain noodles in plain broth. The search continues.
Negative	Just about every Friday I order the same thing, sub, cookie and soda, light ice. The soda would come loaded with ice so about 3 weeks ago I changed it to no ice and for 3 weeks it has come LOADED with ice. I would rather drink a warm soda than a watered down one. I also changed the French bread to garlic herb wrap, and guess what? I came on the French bread. Even though I am a repeat customer, they still need to read my order and notes. One more try and if it's wrong again, I will give up and order from somewhere else.
Negative	"can't say nearly enough bad things about this place.

I completed my paperwork and returned it to the receptionist. One of the forms was to consent to a optical scan (for $32 that's not covered by ins) or have my eyes dilated. I told the receptionist I didn't want either. She said I had to choose one or the other. I've been to  other eye doctors before and with my sight I have never been required to submit to such a test. And I told her as much. She said she would have to talk to the doctor.

I waited over an hour to get my first round of tests. The assistant said she needed to scan my eye. I told her I didn't choose this option and that I didn't want to be charged. She said I wouldn't be charged. Fine, I did it.

Then I waited over 25 minutes for the doctor. He finally showed up, did his little tests and shuffled me to the front to pick out some frames.

Having my eyes measured for frames was the quickest part of my visit. In total I spent over 2 hours for what should have taken 40 minutes at most.  In addition, I was charged $32 for that stupid scan, out of pocket!

First off, I'm annoyed that I was not given a choice regarding my own treatment. I specifically stated I did not want to have the optical scan or dilation and yet they pressed. Second, there is no way I should be charged for a service I didn't want.

I'm calling them back today to get reimbursed for the $32. Let's not even forget that I spent two hours in that office last night. If you're overbooked or short handed, tell your customers so they can decided whether to stay or not. Ridiculous!

As of 6/3 I still have not received my check and this was from over two weeks ago."
Negative	Terrible food and service.  We ordered the food without cilantro and everything we ordered had extra cilantro.  The cook even made a remark that he saw the request for no cilantro and decided against it. The food was overpriced, the drinks were mediocre at best, and the service was some of the worst I've had.  The location is cursed and so is this restaurant, evidently.
Negative	"Just got home from my first visit to BDB.  Look, I grew up in very humble circumstances but this is the Wal Mart of restaurants.  It probably seems wonderful to some folks due to the huge portions but for those with any kind of palate it is really, really, sub-par.

There were 20 of us for a party so therefore there were a variety of plates and I had the opportunity to try several of their entrees.   I just couldn't eat the stuff it was so bad.

Olive Garden is a step up....

Don't do it!!!!"
Negative	"I got the pulled pork sandwich.
- The bread was slightly cold, and probably just bought from the super market.
- The meat was a bit dry.
- The sauce was good, but not notably good.
- The portion size was small. I'm still hungry after eating it.

Overall: disappointing. For $13, you can do much, much better."
Negative	"We went to the Litchfield location and found a mattress that we liked. We also had a favorite from another store we were considering. We worked with Mike and we discussed cost, delivery etc and we negotiated to a final price during the Memorial day sale which still had 2 weeks left until the holiday. We wanted to go home and think about which way we wanted to go between the 2 different stores. After all we would be spending almost $6,000.00 and didn't want to rush our choice. He seemed upset that we weren't selecting his mattress at that point in time. We said we would decide over the weekend and if we liked his mattress we would be back. He told us ""This price is only good for today"". With 2 weeks left on the company wide sale I found that rather offensive and reminiscent of a car salesman. WE WILL NEVER MAKE A PURCHASE UNDER A THREAT LIKE THAT. Needless to say we made our purchase at the other store because mattress stores are a dime a dozen so you need to provide great customer service if you want to stand out."
Negative	I ordered my marriage certificate 3 weeks ago but until now I haven't received anything yet. I called them, left message, email but I haven't got an answer. I really need it and I paid 60 dollars for that. I do hope somebody can help me n if you're not a scam. Thanks.
Negative	I had the worst experience ever. Was given a Classic Blackberry for a gift(took over 45 minutes to buy it and salesperson excused himself numerous times to help other people),  arrived early to have it activated the next morning only to be told store was closed due to robbery, so came back in the afternoonw to have it activated (which never happened)and had the salesperson walk away from me to look after the gentleman fixing the door.  He was so unhelpful and condescending. I also had another salesperson accuse me of yelling at the salesperson which was not the case. We are a large Roger's customer and have been for many years- this outrageous service experience is a sign it's definetly time to move.
Negative	"Not good, the stuff looks great but very dry and lacking in the flavor department. The only reason we stopped there was because our favorite bakery was closed and we wanted sweets. 
The place is dirty as well, I didn't expect that from a shop in Summerlin."
Negative	"Cox Communications is an open sore on the Las Vegas Community. We all know this so when do we do something about it? Vegas is never going to progress as long as this horrifically bad company runs our internet.

They do not invest in the network because they know their days are numbered. They simply patch their broken systems and charge people for what should be fast dependable services. When they are challenged they trot out their list of excuses and recorded bs. It is criminal what is going on. They claim one thing and deliver little more than excuses. Doing so knowingly. They know your neighborhood is never going to get what you are paying (too old outdated) for but will tell you to your face they will. They take your money and do not deliver, that is fraud. In this situation I would say it is robbery."
Negative	"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. First night my boyfriend was attacked by security because a drunk man at the poker table started shouting expletives at him (yet they bum rushed my boyfriend, a Hispanic male with tattoos) . 2nd night we paid for an upgrade to get a better room. Went up, changed went out for the evening/ early morning. When we returned at 3am the TVs weren't working and it was an hour wait for room service to bring up our ""complementary champagne"" (whatevs no biggy) but they decided to send the maintenance man up too and he stayed in the room for over an hr just to tell us we could change to another took at that point. Same type of room we had before... (NOT THE CASE AT ALL) ceiling was a lot lower AND to make matters worse the TV wasn't working AGAIN! So we called to kindly ask if we could have another bottle of champagne for our troubles and were told ""NO"" by Earl at the front desk. He was very rude. At that point i asked to speak with a manager at which point I was told he'd be in in about 10 minutes. I walked down to speak with Edgar one of the assistant managers and he was not much help. He offered to give us back some of our upgrade fees and get us back into a comparable room that we had the previous night. He also found that Earl had given the okay for the extra bottle of champagne (I'm not psychic how i was supposed to know especially after he blatantly said NO). Also, Edgar had a very condescending nature to him and actually laughed at us while my boyfriend and I were expressing our frustrations (HOW UNPROFESSIONAL!)Finally got up to our new room Friday morning at about 8am which was a very nice room but I was still super upset about everything I had to go through the last few days. It was just one hiccup after another and now I come to find out my boyfriend had planned to propose there but that he didn't feel it was the right time and honestly it wasn't I was in a horrible mood, we were celebrating our anniversary and they just don't even care. I am so upset at how the trip went it was my original plan to bring my boyfriend out for vacation but little did I know he wanted to propose and now I'm just so angry. That would have been such a pivotal point in my life and I've always wanted to do that in Vegas. Moral of the story.... Treasure island will tell they can't do anything for you (when they can) but they just don't want to because they don't care about their customers! Beware don't stay there."
Negative	"I hate this Giant Eagle.

Nevermind the long lines. I shop on Sunday mornings, and I know that's just a product of the day I choose to shop. Forget that the produce often times looks a day or two from expiring. Ignore the fact that the store is so unnecessarily large that you need to stretch before you go, lest you pull a muscle or injure yourself in some spectacular fashion.

The biggest gripe about this Giant Eagle in particular is that the store seems to think that when the store is the busiest, that's when you ought to stock your shelves. There's nothing better than your frustration here at the Rocky River Giant Eagle, and I suspect they must power the store via some method that takes your swear words at the carts blocking the aisles. Three carts of frozen food in the middle of the store? Why not! Three kids stocking one shelf of yogurt? Fantastic idea. Fourteen Pepsi reps standing around and talking about the latest product, blocking the entire aisle and staring at you when you dare ask them to move? You're right at home at River Giant Eagle!"
Negative	"I had a crack in my windshield so I had safelite come by my house to install a new one. The full price was 250 for a new windshield and the installation. Not a bad deal! This is where it gets shady. The installer claims that I'm going to need new side mouldings and clips for my car! He sources the parts and claims that it will cost me an additional 229 dollars!

    I looked up the parts and the total price of those parts is 50 dollars! HOLD ON it gets worse. I decided to get a second opinion so I called Glass Now (602-373-5510) they looked at my windshield and said that they would do a full replacement for 200 dollars! They assessed the damage and they said that I did not even NEED new side moulding or clips!

Safelite AutoGlass= roughly 500 dollars

Glass Now= 200 dollars"
Negative	The only reason I didnt give them a one star is because the Sloppy Jose was decent. Their main dish is the buddah bowl and it's terrible. I was told it would take 20 minutes and it took 38 minutes. I get it's a busy night but I ordered a large bowl and I was given a small bowl. A solid tourist trap of overpriced food truck fare.
Negative	"Initially was a big fan of this place, and the curry katsu plates we got there. Until we went back a few times, and then it all went downhill. The second time we went, the curry was cold. The third time we went, the curry was lukewarm and crusted over, like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. The last time we went, we waited 30 minutes for drinks (cans with cups of ice), and an hour for the curry katsu plates that were, this time, terrible and salty and, again, lukewarm. 

Like the other reviewer said, there's no excuse for this kind of service. It's also pretty expensive for what it is. Definitely wouldn't recommend, unless you were going when there are no other customers at all.. that's how it was the first time we went and it was pretty great. But if you go during lunch hour or something and there are other people around.. forget about it."
Negative	"My wife and I decided to take a chance on Fuji despite mixed reviews. So, we didn't exactly go in with high expectations. Also regarding out review, we decided to be seated at a table versus doing Hibachi, so your experience may vary.

We were seated quickly to a semi-full dining room. It took another ~10 minutes before our waiter came by to ask if someone had already had come by to take our drink order. All said and done, we had been seated for about ~20 minutes before we had our drinks and put in our order. 

Trying to get a cross section of what Fuji offers, we ordered some Edemame for the appetizer, we both ordered an Udon entree, my wife getting the Tempura Udon (soup) and me getting the Udon stir fried with beef. We then also each ordered a sushi roll to try what they had from their sushi bar.

The appetizer came out quickly, as did our main courses. The food was hot and seemed freshly made. That being said, both our main courses were pretty bland. The broth for my wife's Udon soup had very little flavor. 

30 minutes after our main course had come out, our sushi rolls had still not come to the table. We had to find our waitress to see where our rolls were. She brought them to the table quickly after we asked, which makes me thing they were sitting on the counter for a while. They were both OK.

That being said, Fuji Japanese Steakhouse earned the two stars from us. As far as a seated dinner goes, we probably won't be back."
Negative	"Not. Real. Good. After my lunch companion picked me up off the floor, I took another look at the bill...and promptly fainted again. $40 is/was/will forever be outrageous for a lackluster Mexican lunch. Got the Carne Asada with the the standard sides (rice and black beans) and the pico and ""guacamole"" (two slices of bland avocado). It was okay at best. Portion sizes are minuscule, but that was okay with me after tasting the rice. We were treated the the sounds of the turbo powered hand dryer in the bathroom, and the servers using the door seemingly in the middle of our table to serve the outdoor guests. Having the bus pan set on our table to clear the plates was a nice touch too. 

It's new, and can learn. I'm rooting for them, but I'll definitely wait awhile before revisiting."
Negative	My family has flown this airline several times without incident. Today was my first time. It's been HORRIBLE!!! Cheap flight price? DONT. BE. FOOLED!!! EVERYTHING (and I mean EVERYTHING) is nicked and dimed! Have a carry on? CHARGED! Have a checked bag? CHARGED.... EACH way! Need a boarding pass? CHARGED! When on hold and told the wait time was 30 minutes and didn't actually get someone for 45 minutes. When we do get some one, they tell me they'll give me a future voucher for $100 off and the flight rescheduled for the next day. Not to mention, the flights to where I am going are only on certain days,so I'm supposed to feel good that they're bringing in a special plane on a day they don't normally fly? Is the $100 per ticket supposed to make me feel better? You just cut my vacation short by 2 days. You just cut me off from seeing a very sick family member by 2 days. Keep your flipping $200! This airline is dead to me! I will NEVER travel them again.
Negative	"I've lived here for nearly 3 years. The apartments themselves is clean and nice inside and out. Neighbors keep to themselves and kind of quite beside the fire trucks always running to the retirement home nearby. But the management here is ridiculous they refuse to work with you on ANYTHING they are very snooty and rude... even if they are in the wrong they shrug it off with a "" well I didn't "" and instead of doing the right thing! Maintenance does take a few days longer then any other apartment complex I've lived in but at least they're kind!..."
Negative	"Horrible customer service, came back to return some chicken I bought that had a horrible stench when I opened it. They had me waiting in customer service and no one would acknowledge me and as soon as someone saw me the only thing I got was ""come back tomorrow!"""
Negative	"Ugh.  The Beauty Bar review.  The one I knew I'd have to do but had been putting off.

There's not much to say that hasn't been said.  If you're completely into hanging out with 19 year olds with hi-fashion mullets who dance like they're trying to kill a swarm of bees emerging from their knees, this is totally your place.  If you're not into conversation or sitting, it's your mecca.  If you like hearing the same Smiths, Joy Division and Depeche Mode songs over. and over. and over. because the 80 are, like, so totally IT right now, please please please go to the Beauty Bar so I won't run in to you.

If you're, oh, 23 or over or actually like a variety of music or don't feel like taking 15 minutes to make your way the same number of feet, you might want to find another place to spend your evening.

When the Beauty Bar first opened up, it was actually pretty delightful.  My crew and I would go there on the weekends, secure a couch in the corner, listen to someone who we probably knew spin some decent records, and drink ourselves blotto around other people who were of age to do so.  It didn't take long for the word to get out, though, and the underage hipster kids came a-runnin' and a-ruinin'.

I added one star to acknowledge the fact that there are sometimes bands that stop there that are actually worth braving all this hullabaloo to see.  I got to see Say Hi To Your Mom, one of my all time favorites, for free, playing three feet away from me.  That partially softened my cold, hard heart."
Negative	"I called in to try and get to customer service about some sliced ham that had been purchased about 2 weeks ago and it had gone bad. 
Slimey.
The capitation date was over a month into the future from today.
When I called in, I was told I was being transferred to customer service, I could hear the ringing, but the call went unanswered and I was shifted back to the switchboard.
Another try, but no sound of ringing, and after about two minutes, I could hear the call being disconnected.
Lessons learned:
1. Won't buy meat there again.
2. The company may not have employees in place that care about customer service."
Negative	Stopped into the bar for happy hour while waiting to meet a friend. Not very busy but bartender failed to greet me for at least 5 minutes. When he did look at me he seemed like he was distracted or if i was adding to his awful day. One beer (20 Oz) for $4 on tap not a bad price but really put off by the experience.
Negative	"I loved the kids play area at first, but it has gone downhill very quickly.  Even getting there as soon as they opened, I found peanuts on the floor (my kids are allergic and there is a sign posted that specifically says ""no food!"").  Additionally, parents let their kids run around with food and drink and don't care about the no food rules or the fact that the kids are making a huge mess.

Some things I've seen:
A two year old with a large soda crawling through a tunnel...spilled soda all over the carpet

A kid with an ice cream cone dripping ice cream on the equipment.  The parents were rude when I asked if they could have their child get off the equipment because he was making a mess.

I haven't been back there in a year because of my experiences there.  I found peanuts TWICE on the floor of the play area.  Very dangerous for kids with peanut allergies in an area where no food is allowed."
Negative	Don't use this company.  I called them for water damage. They did part of work that was to be done. Now they are coming back and say I owe them money for work they did not do.  Never sending a letter from a lawyer that they will sue me.  They received money from my insurance company which paid them more than they should have received. So they owe me money or my insurance company but they want me to pay them more.  Don't use them.  They are scam artists!
Negative	"Only coming to this place because it was close to the dr.

Rating a 1 based on your staff. 
Arrived and the lady in the front wouldn't acknowledge me because she was too busy facebooking. She was rude to everyone that walked in. Acted irritated to have to help anyone. 

Someone in the military field walked in with a cane and she refused all Id except his military id. After he kept telling her that it's illegal to copy the military card, he had to take a seat to make phone calls. 

Literally it's not that hard to find friendly people! If managed this place, if start out by firing everyone."
Negative	"I love my Prius, but I would recommend you buy from another Toyota dealership.

I bought a Used 2016 Prius C from Right Toyota, for about $18k after taxes and extra charges. A pretty good deal.

As I gave the car one last look over, I noticed these little scratches on the back. It's nothing much, covers only about a couple square inches on the back bumper. The Sales Manager on duty, Jason Murdoch, said I could come back and he'd get someone to touch it up. All I would need to do is call in advance and make sure he was there.

Boy am I stupid for not getting this promise in writing.

I called Right Toyota about a week later, and after finally getting a hold of Murdoch he said he'd be in on that Friday at 9am.

I drove there at 9am and he wasn't there at all. One of the other salesmen there said he was due to come in at 11am according to the schedule. I had been lied to straight up.

So I leave, and come back at 11am and guess what, he still wasn't there. At this point I knew something fishy was going on.

The receptionist lady at the front gives his cell phone a call, and he was out getting lunch. Keep in mind this is after he promised me he'd be there at 9am (which he wasn't) and another salesman said he would be there at 11am (which he wasn't).

I gave up at this point, knowing it was not worth my energy to bother with this nonsense they were giving me.

However, my mother went AGAIN in person, and wanted to complain to Jason's manager. They sat her down with a Financial Manager (not in charge of Jason at all) and he basically ignored all of her complaints.

Jason called my mother later that day, saying he had ordered the paint for my car and they'd call me when it came in. This makes 3 lies now, since I had come in twice and I guess they didn't have the paint.

It doesn't even matter at this point, 2 weeks after Jason's call to my mother and I haven't heard from Right Toyota. It's not worth my time or energy, and you shouldn't bother with them.

I understand that dealerships need to make money, but the lengths they've gone to just to avoid a slight paint touch up tells me they DO NOT CARE about Customer Service.

Buy a Toyota Prius though, it's a great car."
Negative	"Adorable bags but they DONT stand behind their products. I have several LV accessories, and I took my bag in bc it developed a tear where the canvas naturally folded down. They refused to fix it telling me that a purse ""won't last forever""! It was 4 years old. Ummm excuse me, but I have lots of luxury items and they actually stand behind their products (Tiffany, Rolex, Chanel, Gucci, ssl, Tory birch, D&G) so before you buy this brand, know that they will arrogantly deny fixing anything lest it happen within the first year of purchase- and only then if you are lucky. #lastLVpurchase #wasteofmoney #unsatisfiedLV #spendyourmoneyelsewhere"
Negative	HORRIBLE STAFF!!! I've been going to Dr. Tabassi for over a year now and each visit I dread having to deal with the rude front office medical assistant. I don't mind the wait times because it's a doctors office, so expect to wait. But having to wait and be greeted with staff rolling their eyes, sighing and other rude and unprofessional gestures and comments is just too much to handle. Dr. Tabassi is a good and personable doctor, which is why I like seeing her. But she definitely needs to upgrade her staff. They're constantly whispering and gossiping about patients and it makes you feel really uncomfortable.
Negative	My service from appetizers to the main course was absolutely trash. Spinach artichoke dip was burnt and the waitress left the plate sitting there until we left. The main course I ordered was completely disgusting and it came with the wrong cheese! I ordered onion rings as well and got fries. Bbq chicken overall decent though
Negative	The root beer is excellent. The flavor of the Chicago pizza is decent but tonight they had poor production. The pizza was paper-thin in the center and very thin for the rest of the bottom. The edges were like popovers and so thick the inside was doughy and not fully cooked. The sauce was so runny that after taking one piece out, the sauce actually ran out into the pan. There isn't any cornmeal in the crust either. Maybe it's better with different preparers, but tonight was not a good night for them.
Negative	"such a great experience today: 

-love that i paid nearly $9 for a ""Large"" soup that was not even halfway full. the employee even wiped my soup bowl with the rag that the other employee was using to clean the tables. 
-when i approached the regsitrar about it she said that they don't fill the soups because they do not want it to spill.. the to-go bowl was not even filled halfway. 
-since i ordered to-go, the employee bagged the salad to find out when i got to my car that the bottom of the bag has a massive hole underneath. Since my salad fell through the rip, the ranch inside exploded all over it.... didn't even eat the $9 salad.
-the cherry on top: when my sick sister was in the midst of eating her soup, we found a long piece of hair inside. 

Definitely did not eat the two things I ordered that costed me $18. 

I used to only come here to support the schools fundraising, but there's a reason why I never return. I only came since my younger sister is very sick and wanted their soup. I'm so incredibly disappointed."
Negative	I'm so disappointed I like this restaurant.  And the decor and service is good.   My wife and I had dinner  Tuesday night.   I had pasta rigatoni and my wife asked about the special.    It sounded good a white fish grouper I think.  With a bed of a pasta.     It was ok nothing to write home about.   My pasta was good as usual under $15.     But when I got the bill $28.00 for the fish plate.  It was worth half  at best. And the waiter said nothing of the price      I have learned a lesson at this restaurant, no specials for us and I will alway have the sting of $28 for the fish.      For the owners have your staff announce the price of your specials.   It felt like a scam in a tourist area.    And if you have a $28 plate make it worth it.
Negative	"Very disappointed with the service. They surely are not concerned with the quality of their customer service. It was my first time going to pep boys they had to register me. I wanted an oil change the guy just handed me papers to sign didn't even bother going over whats included what they check all my questions answered with an ""uh"". Surprise charge at the end. Plus, several people were in the garage, didn't look slammed and it took 1hr and a half. Said to say, much much better experience at walmart."
Negative	"Horrendous Food! Lacks any quality or innovation and is atrociously overpriced.

My boyfriend and I were in town for the Grand Prix weekend and decided to find a restaurant on Peel Street to enjoy our last evening. The restaurant was pretty empty which should have been our first indicator as an empty restaurant on Peel St during Grand Prix weekend is unlikely. We ordered wine, shrimp cocktail ($23.00) and fried calamari to start. The appetizers came out and we were horrified. The shrimp was completely yellow/grey - obviously not fresh and the martini serving glass had cocktail sauce with a comical mountain of arugula over top. The shrimp smelled awful and were chewy with a concerning overly fishy taste. The presentation with very 80's and laughable for the price. The shrimp were so tiny and not even remotely worth the $23.00 price tag. The calamari were obviously frozen and from a bag. The squid looked like onion rings and were very chewy. 

After the appetizers we immediately paid our bill and went directly next door to the sushi restaurant called RYU which was absolutely incredible!

I cannot believe that they're getting away with serving such grotesque food. It's such a shame because the location is great and with a more educated owner and qualified chef this place could be great. This owner needs a sincere wake up call. DO BETTER."
Negative	"The worst McDonalds I have been to. What happened to i'm lovin' it ®?  I asked for the 2 for $3.33 Sausage Egg McMuffin with a folded egg instead of the regular egg, which makes me sick. I have never had any issue at any other McDonald's. I was told we can not do it. After speaking to the manager and telling the lady taking my order. I was simply told our owner doesn't allow us to do that. The other option was to just order two sandwiches with folded eggs for about $6-7 dollars instead of the $3.33.

If I eat the egg the way it comes I will throw up. Please tell me how it is that hard to make an egg a different way on a sandwich."
Negative	What happened to Siu Wok?! We ordered Salt n Pepper Shrimp and it's a disaster! It used to be lightly breaded pan fried shrimp with some flavorful garlic sauce/juice at the bottom of the box that u can pour over ur rice. Now its deep fried full breaded and it's dryer than Tyrone Biggums lips. Bring back the old cooks PLEASE!
Negative	First time ever in Rio and their well known carnival world buffet and most defiantly the last time .. after finishing my meal , i was sitting in the booth with my girlfriends and a couple of them across the table from me , all of a sudden my friend with a mouthful of food screams and says theres a bug... I turn around and its a Fricken COCKROACH !!!!!!!!!!!!  I jumped and it went back crawling into the booth .. he popped out again from the seat and went back in ! Just so you know COCKROACHES don't just live by themselves , they travel in colonies  .... we got a manager that was very helpful and totally sweet to use all , she refunded our money back ... seriously that wasn't a great experience.
Negative	"My fiancé and I stayed here over the weekend for a wedding. It seemed cheaper than most anything on the strip, but I guess that alone should have been a red flag.

We reserved a premium, non-smoking room with a king sized bed. It was run down, but I had seen worse elsewhere.
Though, the next day as we got ready for the wedding, we saw a cockroach run across the floor. Not acceptable.

We informed the front-desk of the roach, and while the clerk gave us a bit of attitude, she said they would switch our rooms when we returned from the wedding.
Since we were tired when we got back and didn't want to wait in the long line at the desk, we just figured we would call the front-desk from our room to get the switch done. Should have been simple...

About 10 minutes of either busy signals or endless ringing later, we were getting annoyed. We called the bellhop, which amazingly answered immediately. They were very helpful, and suggested to ignore the line and go straight to the windows for the switch.
After finally getting our new room keys, we called the bellhop back to help us move. They were there in less than 5 minutes. But as we opened the door to our second room, we realized that it was not only non-premium, but that there were two full beds, instead of the single king.
 
We attempted the phones again, but ended up going back to the front desk. We told the clerk about our issues. Her only response was, ""Oh, that wasn't a roach, it was just a water bug, we have those here!"" WHAT? My fiancé finally just said, ""No... we need for you to make this right."" Out came the manager...

The issues were explained again, and the guy at least pretended to look shocked and upset for us. He explained that they had a limited number of premium, king bed rooms, but that he would see what he could do for us, and then vanished behind some doors for about 5 minutes. When he returned, he told us our rates would be reduced by more than half for both nights, and that they were working on getting us a better room. He disappeared again for about 10 more minutes. Then he gave us new room keys, and we were on our way (again...).

Room #3 had the right bed, and did not look as beat up and worn as room #2, but we're pretty sure it was non-premium. But at that point we gave up. We had a decent room and were paying much less than we expected, and we figured there was not anything else that they could (or would) do for us.

Bottom line... avoid. It's cheap, which is nice, but really not worth the hassle. If they had a cleaner, better kept establishment, we would have been fine in the first room. It really seems that they've simply given up on this place. It smells musty, looks incredibly dated, and after staying there for a weekend, it's just gross. I don't like the idea of roaches crawling about my belongings.

And the customer service skills over-all were incredibly lacking. Even the cocktail waitresses in the casino would take orders, and then simply not return with the drinks. There is much better out there than this place, that is for sure."
Negative	Went for Sunday brunch on a first visit... empty parking lot was a clue. Inside the buffet beyond where the average pizza selections were displayed was too dim to easily distinguish what was being offered. Very embarrassed to have taken friends here WITHOUT checking it out first! Will never go back.
Negative	We just came home from Cinnamons and I was really disappointed with what I had ordered. The regular locomoco. The patties were burnt and didn't taste like homemade...pancakes were not good unless you poured alot of syrup on and this is mind you my first experience as I never had the chance to eat the one back in Kailua...We were there for the Aha Aina meeting and the manager himself looked disorganized. We know it was busy but that's not an excuse. The servers were nice and the one local girl who handled the orders with the kitchen knew what she was doing. I personally didn't like the fact we had to order in line and then wait for our food and that took almost half hour...you have servers..use them..they are only their to bring your food and water and even that was missed..I'll probably not be coming back as we can get better pancakes at baby stacks...there are other local places where food is better...I was was hoping this place was all that but it wasn't....hopefully they fix it. It starts with the manger....my mana'o and experience...
Negative	Terrible service, which is a shame because we found the service throughout the casino to be great. In here for about 45 minutes and saw our server twice. Food was average. Nothing special. Won't be making the trek back especially since it's so far from the strip. Free parking though, so that's a bonus.
Negative	"I leased a car with Findlay Toyota and my lease is up in November so I started looking at what other cars I might interested in trading it in for. When we pulled up our car fax for trade in value we found out that the car had been in an accident a month before it was sold to us. On the car fax it says it was in a side swipe collision and it was NEVER disclosed to us. I would have never leased or purchased a car with an accident on it. There is a reason I am buying a new car and not a used one. The value I am paying for the vehicle is full price with no accident deduction. Not only that but it hurts the value if I did want to trade it in. When I went in to the dealership to ask how this happened and what was going to be done about it the internet sales manager continued to press that it's not a big deal. I'm sorry if you are buying a ""new"" car and you end up with one with an accident on it then yes it is a big deal. I feel completely lied to and I will NEVER buy a car from this dealership again and I am seeking legal counsel. This was just the cherry on top of my experiences with them. Before this I purchased a used car with them and I had to bring it in to the shop so many times and it never worked properly so I got into the lease just to get out of that awful car. When the salesman took the car back he even said this car is barely drive able (he was the one that sold it to me ). My advice to anyone looking to buy or lease a car is to look elsewhere!! Buyer beware and ask for a car fax on EVERY car you get off their lot. New or used!"
Negative	We visited Henderson and tried to get a cab to the strip.. Our hotel called this company for us.. After 30 minutes, we inquired about our car so they gave us the number to call. We called Deluxe 4 or 5 times to have them pick up and hang up the phone. We called once more and they just let it ring... And let it ring. Luckily Star Cab showed up by chance and saved the day. Deluxe is the least dependable cab company on the planet.
Negative	"Very disappointing experience - first time flying Porter Air.

Trip from Newark Airport to Toronto was fine.   Old prop planes - no wifi.   No big deal - short flight.   The B Gates where Porter is located at Newark is rather sad but adequate.   Decent first experience flying to Toronto - not wow but not disappointing.

Flying back was very disappointing.   Flight delay information in email differed from what was on the website.   Tried to get clarification at Check-in where a very unprofessional gentleman behaved inappropriately.   He refused to give his name and said he was sending me for additional security screening (SSSS) - I was shocked by his behavior.   I asked an agent in the lounge area to give me the check-in agents name so I could file a complaint and she said all she'd give me is his agent ID (3121) and she said more than once that I was having a bad day and she hoped my day would get better - I felt that too was unprofessional (and she too wouldn't provide any identifying information - nobody wears name badges or anything).

I've always had very good experiences with Air Canada and I have elite status with the variance alliances so all in all while City Airport is nice, I prefer to fly on a more professionally run airline."
Negative	Walmart money center now believes they have the right to question immigration status. My wife uses her foreign passport to send money internationally and those idiots question her expired visa. I did not know Walmart customers associate are part time ice officers. Mind your own dam business. You have no clue on immigration law. It is not our requirement  to prove we have legal status in the us.  If you use a foreign passport at arroyo crossing Walmart they check your visa and expect you to explain. Do that shit again and you will get filmed and sued. Stop discriminating and start doing your 8 dollar an hour job.
Negative	So you're a camera store but you don't carry anything to clean a lens other than a $20 cloth?  I was quite surprised by this based on the large selection of items and the size of their location.  The sales guy didn't even really seem to be backing his product as he tried to make excuses to convince me to buy the cloth.  Thanks but no thanks!
Negative	"I must be at a different place than I went 2 years ago.  I remember a fun atmosphere and good food at a decent price.  Tonight I had a 15$ juicy burger which was anything but.  Dry and flavorless is a better description.  My wife had the pulled pork and her exact description was ""meh"".  The place is dirty and not as lively as it was.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I give this two stars and not just one.  If you are about to pull into the parking lot, you would be much more satisfied walking over to Jac's or driving a little farther to Gates and Brovi for the same price."
Negative	"Do yourself a favor.. stay somewhere else! 


This is one of the most BS hotels in Vegas. When booking and scheduling, not once did they mention the hotel was under construction and remodel. Half the restaurants for the place are closed and you wind up walking to another resort to eat. They basically have a mall type food court, or $55 per person buffet.

The rooms and amenities are old and dingy, furniture is scratched as hell, my floor and room constantly smelled like pot. The walls are paper thin and you can't sleep if your neighbor is making any kind of noise at all.

The staff is semi friendly, but regardless, the hotel is completely understaffed. You're going to wait In a ridiculous line to get coffee, water, etc. There is no real connivence items in the room, coffee maker, water, etc., and there isn't even a pay bar in the room either. It's BS..!! Curtains don't close all the way, room temperature is always in the 80s, no matter what you set the AC at.  Room service is constantly moving your shower/bath items, including taking the soap. You have to open new soap everyday..???

I was absolutely disappointed in this stay and will likely never be back after renovation.  It might be a better story if they had good customer service.. but they seem to struggle at that. I felt like I was staying in a 40 year old roadside motel..  not Vegas quality, but totally Vegas prices.."
Negative	"We have been eating here off and on for a few years. We used to love this place. What has changed?  The quality seems to have gone down quite a bit. My wife likes saba but the last several times it has been over pickled and under cooked. I can almost say ""nothing special here"" except for the udon noodles!

I really like udon noodles and the tempura udon on the menu here is very good! It has big slices of shiitake mushrooms, rich broth and loads of noodles. It is why we still go to Ginza."
Negative	The food is disgusting, they have have no idea what spanish food is all about.  The manger owner has never been to Spain and he claims to know what spanish food should taste like.  Do not come here go to firefly is you want spanish food.
Negative	Disappointed in the room's cleanliness.  French fries on the floor, food crumbs on the nightstand, obviously not swep or vacuumed in a while.  I hope the beds have clean sheets!    This was in room # 102.
Negative	DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR.  The manager, I believe of indian or Syrian decent is one of the most prejudice individuals I have ever met in my entire life.  His attitude is discussing.  Please join me in boycotting this establishment.  I will never, ever eat here again.  Nasty, despicable place. I will forever let any person who will listen to me know that this place is a throwback to Jim Crow days.
Negative	"Why is it that every time you walk into a department store everyone ignores you? Perhaps I'm just accustom to good friendly service, but isn't that something you really expect. . . especially at higher-end establishments.  Really, it's not hard,  if you see someone perusing your section you:

1. walk up
2. say ""hi, can I help you find anything?"" followed by ""ok"" or ""well let me know, Ill be right over there.""  or perhaps if someone has clothing in their hand ""can I start a fitting room for you?""  See, it's not that hard.

Alright, so admittedly I wasn't here to buy as I'm currently broke,  however I was pre-shopping for family members who have no idea what's going on and wanted some recommendations.  

I went to the jeans department and perused the selection of diesel and g-star.  IGNORED

I went to the men's suit section.  IGNORED

I went to the women's shoe department.  IGNORED

I perused the men's fragrances, and happily was not ignored (in fact they were downright pleasant and helpful!), although I was sent to the Dior counter where I wish I had been ignored.  

I was greeted by a rather rude employee when I was looking to try Dior por homme (hey, I'm broke, but free samples is free samples).

He didn't understand, and showed me the women's line, then when I asked if he had anything else he stormed off, came back a few minutes later with three more women's tester and said ""there"" 

Oh, and did I mention he just handed them to me without blotters, and then when I went to smell the nozzle he got snippy and  told me to use kleenex.  KLEENEX???  You've gotta be kidding me.  That's when it hit me ""Wait, there's a Sephora in this mall.  BYEEEEEE""

This kind of service normally makes me give one star,  but they have lots of stuff.  So if you don't care how you're treated and don't mind carrying your clothes around like you're shopping at Wal-mart,  Nordstrom is fine."
Negative	"Would give ""0"" stars if possible, as after 2 hours waiting, my bird never was seen for his wellness visit and nail trim. Had an 11:00 am appt, and being new to town got a little lost thru airport connector, but courteously called at 11:05 to say I has .7 miles away. I was put on hold and then told I would need to reschedule, as they were backed up already and me being late would make it worse (??). I let her know I had driven from Summerlin and had the bird with me and really inconvenient and was already almost there. Arrived to 2 people in the waiting room, the one lady ahead of me had waited 2 hours herself and had a sick bird. I arrived at 11:10, no one at reception and waited 20 min for someone to inquire if they could help and then acted confused as to what my visit was for, ie why did my bird need to be seen? (Don't you have it listed in the schedule as we discussed at length when inset the appt) Sat there for 90 minutes with no check in by the staff whatsoever -they were more concerned with who didn't have a car to go get lunch at jack in the box. At 12:50 pm, once I was sure previous patients were gone I asked about timing of being seen. She really couldn't say as ""an emergency just called in"" and they'd have to see them when they arrived. Sat there 10 more minutes hoping to be seen before emergency arrived and nothing. Emergency patient arrived and I left. Not so much as an ""I'm sorry for the delays"" or a follow up phone call to find out where we went or if they could reschedule. Flamingo Clinic obviously doesn't have enough vets on staff to manage the customer flow, as I have had my bird 6 years and vets in Phoenix and Boston and never been made to wait more than 10-15 minutes. My time is just as valuable as theirs, but they don't seem to get that concept, nor care to have my bird as a regular patient. No worries as have already found several other options who were more than happy to take us in, with much nicer, cleaner facilities. Flamingo Clinic was a very unsettling experience -Rude, non-client centric business-not sure how you stay in business."
Negative	"DO NOT COME HERE. This place is horrible and a waste of money. We arrived on time for our appointment, but had to wait 35 minutes for our treatments. My ""reflexologist"" was extremely lazy and unprofessional. What she gave me shouldn't even be called reflexology as there were no pressure points being massaged. In fact, she barely even touched the soles of me feet. She was lathering lotion and giving me a light shin rub the entire time, while occasionally grazing the top of my feet. Even more ridiculous was that she was on her cellphone the entire time, and massaging me with ONE hand. What kind of half assed treatment do you provide your customers? This felt like a scam and they require you to tip minimum $10."
Negative	Last time I was there my wife, son and I waited forever for someone to take our order. Then, the food (all of it) was either made incorrectly or ice cold. The place was not busy. They did a few things to try to resolve the issues but by this point, we had already been there for hours and just wanted to leave. They did apologize and remove SOME of the food from the bill. Still, I paid lots of money and left hungry and annoyed. If you ask me.... you want a beer while watching the game... this is your place. Want to eat with your family... go somewhere else.
Negative	"The stars are coincidentally for the chicken. On 12/20/16 my 8 month pregnant wife, 16 month daughter and I went on a drive to get my daughter a power nap. The nap didn't work and I was hungry so we stopped at Panda Express. I ordered the biggest plate which is 4 small portions and my wife ordered the regular 3 portion plate and we both got teriyaki chicken. The chicken was being cooked so the girl told us she would bring it out. I went to the register and another girl punched the order in and gave me a total of 19.50 or so (this is where it's my responsibility to do math and ensure she rang everything up.  After 7-8 minutes and people who ordered after us walking by with teriyaki chicken my wife went up to the counter. The conversation between her and the two girls lasted longer than I expected between a customer who wants chicken they paid for and two employees so I went up. What had apparently happened was the girl I ordered from acknowledged I ordered the large plate but she said the other girl didn't charge me for it (it's a 1.50) so she couldn't give it to me.... OK I said, just give me 2 chickens instead of 3 and refund me.... Girl tilts her head, rotates the microphone out from her face and says... ""What for?"" We'll probably because after ten minutes my wife, daughter and I don't have any chicken. This is when she tells me she'll need a manager. I was honestly excited because obviously the manager would understand the concept of customer service as well as the idea that her employees ringing my order up wrong and acknowledging they did, should not result in an argument over 1.50 in chicken. At this point it was purely an argument for me based on principal. Anyways the manager comes up and asks what happened. I told her there was a miscommunication between her two employees on what was ordered and rang in, my family had no chicken and I wanted our 3 orders..... I kid you not, the manager looks at me and says ""I can't give you 3 because you only paid for 2.""  Convinced she didn't hear what happened, I explained that her employee acknowledged she rang me up wrong, it's not my responsibility to do math at a register and I asked if she was really willing to lose a customer over a dollar fifty and a bad review online. She was more than willing so here I am. If someone wants to reach out to me from this restaurant  I'll gladly post a follow up based on my interaction with them but as of now I can see why they currently have two stars. MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
Negative	"Tried twice. First attempt -  brunch was a disappointment. Mid morning and already out of the sausage meal.  French toast is something you either love or hate. A single piece of deep fried bread doesn't do it for us.  On the positive side, the jam was good and you got your own personal sized jar of it.

Friday night fish fry.  Arrived at 5:30 and only two tables were already seated. There were 5 wait staff and a manager/owner (?) visible. Requested extra lemon for my fried cod only to learn that they were out of lemons. Seems like someone should have run the mile to the store to buy lemons on a Friday Fish Fry night.  

Cod dinner consisted of two fish stick sized pieces. They were cooked well, but under seasoned and overpriced. Luckily, I kept the parmesan cheese dust from my cheese curd appetizer and used it to add flavor ... since they had no lemons and I detest tarter sauce - my only other seasoning alternative. 

Coleslaw was tasty. Fries were good. Marbled rye bread might as well be Wonder Bread for all the flavor it had. The single slice came cut in half, pre-buttered and stuck buttered face together. What if you don't like butter? This butter was completely tasteless. 

I wish the owner would focus less on marketing his farm to table concept and actually deliver on high-quality food. We'd love to support a local restaurant but won't be returning."
Negative	"Bad day at Fry's. This store was out of the blueberries on VIP special, out of Jenny-O sausage, out of pork tenderloins, and nearly out of the deli meats that we needed. On top of that, service with a smile seems to have left the building. I asked an employee near the self-check area if he was the self-check attendant. The guy doesn't even look at me, replies, ""No!"", and walks away. Then when I do find the attendant, she rudely snatches my coupon from my hand and without saying a word, completes my transaction. What lousy customer orientation. Hope this does not continue."
Negative	Disappointing.  it is hard for buffets to shine anyway.  Lot's of food contamination I saw plus the food taste was worse than Golden Corral at about the same price.
Negative	This place is grossly overpriced for the service. $40 for a SNS color change (no manicure). They are all distracted the whole time they are with you and just joking amongst themselves. They look out the window more than they look at your nails. This place used to be owned by different people I believe. New management is NOT GOOD.
Negative	My phone upgrade is available on 1/16, which is 10 days from today.  I went in to find out if I could upgrade, and was told by the manager that I would have to come back in 10 days, or I could pay $20 a month for a new phone.  Really??? You have a customer that is willing to drop $300 on a new phone, and you're going to send them away and ask them to come back in 10 days.  I have been a Verizon customer for 5+ years, but the customer service level at Verizon has become ridiculous.  I am extremely disappointed in their level of service and care towards my situation.  I spend $186 per month on service, which equates to a little over $2,200 a year.  The executives of Verizon Wireless can thank their Manager at this store location for losing me as a customer, and my $2,200 a year.
Negative	"A horror show from start to finish. The hostess was sweet and the margaritas were good but everything else was a disaster.

It feels as though Silvana has licensed her name and reputation to a place that bears no connection to her cooking or philosophy in any real way. It's like how you'll find the mass-produced crap at Marshall's or TJ Maxx with the Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren or Donna Karan name, but it's not really their stuff. This was mass-produced college dorm or food court Mexican food coming from a kitchen with seemingly no adult supervision. It was kids ladling bland, dry, overcooked, poor quality glop from troughs. Everything tasted like everything else. The ""vegetable"" was a pile of oily corn from a can. The food wasn't even warm when it arrived, and the dry, cold tortillas were broken - not a single one intact - and they were terrible quality. At the very least I expected homemade salsas or hot sauces, not the bottled garbage on the table. 

I was looking forward to this meal, having grown up in Los Angeles and as someone who lives in a Mexican neighborhood in Brooklyn, and with Silvana's rep and the flashy website presentation - I was expecting something elevated and interesting, or at the very least, competently executed.

Another issue was the room/ambience. Charmless, poorly lit and designed, and I felt like our table was in some auxiliary waiting area rather than an actual place to eat dinner. It was hectic and uncomfortable, to say the least. And I can deal with casual, industrial and un-precious - this was just straight unpleasant.

Worst of all was our service. We waited over 20 minutes to order and the place wasn't even that crowded. Our server, I'll skip leaving her name here because she's already been mentioned on yelp as abysmal, was horrendously rude and incompetent. She finally took our order, didn't bring half the stuff we ordered and never mentioned it or apologized until I finally said something. She had no excuse, no apology, just said yeah, don't bank on it arriving. And it didn't. And she never asked us how we were, if we needed anything, if we'd like to know about the desserts, etc. She just slammed our check down and left.

This place feels like it's in its last days or something. I have to believe it's on the decline and at some point it was better because if it was always this terrible, its reputation and profile are puzzling, to say the least. 

Major stinkfest."
Negative	"Not the Farmhouse replacement...I haven't even been, but I am going to say ""it doesn't compare"".  We had to wait a long time, we couldn't sit outside because there weren't enough sun shades/umbrellas, food was average for breakfast, the spicy bloody mary was good.  People were nice enough but its a bar atmosphere at the end of the day."
Negative	"I'm actually quite bummed to have to be writing this, as the folks at CP Auto seem very nice, and I selected them to work on my car based on all the positive feedback here, but my experience with their ability to manage expectations and deliver what they promise on-time has been just terrible. I'll summarize by saying that they promised to have work done on my car by the end of April, 2016, and it's now August and after repeated (i.e. 6-7) missed delivery dates I'm still without my car. I've restricted my remarks to strictly the facts of the matter, so judge for yourself whether I'm being reasonable in my review. The below is from my complaint to the Better Business Bureau.

In Nov. of 2015 I received a quote from CP Auto to do a repaint of my 1971 MGB (i.e. all necessary removal of parts and prep for painting, painting, and re-assembly). The owner of CP Auto quoted me $3200-$3800 and a timeframe of between four and six weeks to complete the job. I dropped the vehicle off on March 1, 2016.

In early April I called to check on the progress of the vehicle and was told I needed to let them know which color I wanted it painted. I was told I could expect my car to be done before May 20. 

Earlier the week of May 16th, I called CP Auto to check on progress and get a final quote and delivery date. After several unreturned calls seeking this information, I went into CP Auto, and found that no work had been done on the car at all. An employee at CP Auto let me know that the owner was not available to talk to me, but that I could expect to pick up the vehicle in three weeks' time. 

After repeated calls to CP Auto, I finally got the owner on the line and let him know how frustrated I was with this lack of progress and lack of communication. I told him that if he was unable to provide me with a schedule of activities and milestones that I should be able to observe over the next three weeks, that I would prefer he put the vehicle back as he received it and I would seek to have the work done elsewhere.  At this time I received assurances from the owner that the work would be done in the timeframe, that I could expect to see the car primered the following week and that actual painting would be done in two weeks' time. On May 17th I sent an email to the owner confirming my understanding of these timeframes and milestones and asking for him to confirm the final price. I did not receive a reply to this email.

The agreed upon three weeks came and went, and other commitments kept me from following up on the progress on the car. In late June I went into CP Auto and found that the car had indeed gotten a coat of primer, but still had not been painted Regardless, as I was happy to see any progress at all, I let the matter slide and took the CP Auto employee's assurance that the work would be done in two weeks time.

About two weeks after that, I returned to CP Auto to find that the car had been painted.  At that time I asked the employee showing me the car when I could expect to have it put back together and done, and was told ""two weeks"".  Later the day of my visit I received an email from the owner with photos of the car attached letting me know it was ""almost ready!"" When I replied asking for cost and a specific date it would be ready, I received no reply. The date of this email was Aug. 5, 2016, or approximately 3-3.5 months past the initial promised date of delivery.

Visiting CP Auto on Aug. 8th I was told by the owner the car would be ready for that Friday. I let him know that I didn't need it for Friday, but could he please just promise to have it ready for the following Monday. I was astonished at the time to hear his response of ""well, I can't commit to that"". So transparently false was his commitment to the Friday Aug 12 delivery date, that when pressed, he was unwilling to commit to getting me the vehicle three days later. 

On Friday, Aug. 19, 2016 I called CP Auto to check to see when I could expect the car, and speaking to the employee I had been dealing with to-date I was told ""We'll definitely have that ready for you in two weeks"". Exasperated, I asked ""Why would I possibly believe that?"". His answer was ""I don't know"". Asking ""would you put up with this sort of thing?"" His answer was ""No"". 

On Friday Aug. 19th I sent the owner of CP Auto an email setting out my intention to contact the BBB and an attorney, and recount my experiences with CP Auto on consumer ratings sites, if I didn't hear from him ASAP with a commitment to have the vehicle ready on Wed, Aug. 24th and a final price for all work. It is Mon. Aug. 22nd as I write this, and I have not heard back from him.

Update: September 22nd, still no car, still no communication from CP Auto"
Negative	"I'm not one to complain and I won't call her out by name because the stylist was nice, but this is not a place to go if you need your head shaved. It is expensive and you can see the outcome from my pictures. 

This was the first barber I had been to in 10 years after shaving my head myself. Initially thought the price was steep for the ""Ultimate Experience"" at $60, but thought I'd give it a try as I also needed my beard shaved. 

The stylist was very friendly and I tipped well as I didn't notice anything until later that night when I tried to put a hat on and found my head to be extremely irritated. The shave was fine, but I ended up with a head full of razor burn. Guess I'll go back to cutting my own hair."
Negative	"I was waiting for my friend to show up for a concert across the street, and decided to get a quick bite to eat. I always see this place and decided why not. 

Big mistake. I walked in and sat at the counter. I had to ask for the counter to be cleaned/wiped, and still ended up wiping it again myself after they finished. Then it took a few minutes before i was greeted. After placing my order, I waited and waited. 

Once the order came, that was the final disappointment. The home fries, were under-cooked. I asked for cheese on them, and they added a few sprinkles of finely shredded cheddar. They barely let the cheese melt. The sausage was ok.  The bacon was 2 teeny weenie strips that appeared to be under-cooked also. 

Overall disappointing experience!"
Negative	Worst pedicure I've had in Henderson. Not only did the nail tech do a poor job painting my nails, he also stopped in the middle of the pedicure to make several phone calls. He tried to paint clear nail polish with one hand. When he was done, he just got up to prep for the next client, didn't mention to me that I was done or if I needed to go under a dryer, I had to flag him down to tell me he was finished. Will NOT be going back to this place.
Negative	This place is over hyped. The chicken teriyaki is bland and dry. The sushi was also bland and I tried the hot papa as well as spicy salmon roll. Plenty better Japanese places in town. Hokkaido is by far the best and down the street!
Negative	"I was shocked when I first moved to the valley and saw Fry's for the first time. The place is huge. If you are a computer nerd or any kind of electronics nut, this is a wonderful toy store. If you are in the market for a desktop, consider buying parts from Newegg or Amazon and paying the staff to build it. Chances are you will still get more power for less money than a prebuilt tower!

The store now price matches online retailers. Between that and Amazon finally charging Arizona state sales tax, there is no longer a huge disparity in price between Fry's and Amazon.

Now for the 2 star part. One of the big complaints people have about Best Buy is lack of floor staff. For years, that didn't seem to be a problem at Fry's. But my last couple of trips are now mirroring Best Buy. Today we went to get a Roku box. We stood in line for about 20 minutes with 2 people in front of us to ask for help finding one. They were not with the DVD players, the TVs, or even the Google boxes. Several employees walked by but none were the ""manager"" on the picture, none offered to help anyone waiting for help, none even said anything to us. 

Eventually someone asked if we needed anything. We told him we were looking for a Roku box. He asked how much we were looking to spend and we said about $100 and that we were looking for the Roku 3. The first thing he said was to double our budget and we could get a Google box. Eventually he told us where to find the Rokus (other side of the store... with internal PC hard drives for some reason).

To anyone at Fry's that may read this. I appreciate that your prices are as good as anyone else's. But why would I drive halfway across the valley to go to your location, be ignored, wander around aimlessly for half an hour, and then have to drive home? That lack of service is what is killing Best Buy. I'll just sit at home and wait for my from Prime shipping if this is the service I can expect. Which is a shame because this store really is just a giant toy store and is tons of fun to browse. But it's full of frustration to shop now."
Negative	I have been to Tuffy's twice and have had zero done to my vehicle. Today, I thought I would give them a shot for a basic NC Inspection. I was stopped  before I got to the door by a staff member who physically grabbed me to let me know they didn't have a time for inspections available until 3 pm.  I would have to think he saw my registration in hand. No problems.  I might have considered coming back but I just have a very difficult time believing they are in the habit of physically grabbing their customers. Even moreso, do they grab male customers in the same manner to inform them that they are busy that day?  Vehical inspections are an annual requirement and I have been driving for many, many years. This is the first time I have been physically turned around at an inspection station and I seriously hope it will be the only time.
Negative	"I'm being punked right?! 

This is the worst barbecue I have ever eaten in my life! The owner ""Mr Willie"" was either high or drunk or both! There were flys flying around inside the restaurant. I really like the decor and atmosphere of the place. There are a couple big comfy chairs with a place to read, a pool table and a couple of arcade games to play while waiting for your food. After reading a few reviews on line it turns out that the restaurant used to be a coffee shop that must have left most of the interior behind when they went out of business. 

I had the beef ribs, plain chicken wings, mac and cheese and what was suppose to be baked beans. My daughter had a beef rib and corn on the cob and my wife had a pulled pork sandwich with corn on the cob. 

My ribs were tough. The sauce was horrible! My mac and cheese had the consistency of baby food. WWWWAAAAYYYY over cooked. And the so called bake beans weren't even baked beans weren't even baked beans. They were pinto beans in some type of baked bean sauce. The only thing halfway decent was my wings which were small and cold from sitting out for hours. 

My wife said her food was so so. My daughter liked her rib and corn but, thought the mac and cheese was gross. She'll pretty much eat anything! 

When we were done I looked for ""Mr Willie: to complain and he was gone and left to boys there about 10 or 11 years old on their own! After spending $35 for our trash of a meal we should have gone across the street to Mineo's or Napoli's!"
Negative	"Short and sweet:  a local restaurant with a poor selection of beer, why don't they offer some of the outstanding local craft beers? Not just the crowd pleasers, but some good IPAs and stouts?  If only some good beer, I would be in once or twice a week.  And, it's in poor taste for a ""Mexican"" restaurant to charge for chips. The authentic places provide chips free of charge. 

I'm disappointed, but not a lost cause ... hope these guys come around to better beer and I'll become a regular."
Negative	"Stopped in at Casino on Saturday night while out celebrating Father's Day and found the Palo Verde Lounge CLOSED for remodeling. WTH? And it won't re-open til Sept/Oct?  This was a very pleasant, enjoyable spot to relax with an adult beverage and now there is NO where to sit.  The few nearby lounge chairs were taken and people were having to stand in a crowded, tiny area -- not condusive to an enjoyable experience and we were very disappointed to say the least.

We wondered over to check out the slot machines and saw over-flowing ashtrays, trash not cleaned up and empty glasses & bottles throughout the casino floor. This was about 9pm on a Saturday nite (prime time) and no one can clean up the mess? This does not reflect well on the managers or the casino.

Our group sat down to try our luck at Roulette and there are no cup holders to hold our drinks while gambling. Come on, Talking Stick.  Get your act together. This used to be THE place in town for a great casino experience and you are really dropping the ball."
Negative	I walked in the store and had to call out several times to get someone.  Took the model number of my appliance.  Gave the guy my paperwork and told him what I needed. He took the paperwork and went to answer the phone.  He proceeded to answer about 6 phone calls while I waited and waited.  Then he finally asked me about the part I needed in an annoyed manner.  I showed him what I needed and the phone rang again. Again I had to wait.  Finally, he said they don't make it anymore and that was it.  He no longer was interested in me and took more phone calls. He was unfriendly and unhelpful.  Went there because they are the only repair place in town.  Wanted to work with local businesses.  I have told everyone I know how awful the service was. I would have given them zero stars , but it was a required field.
Negative	"Will never go back.
I booked an appointment for the $45 package with 30min foot + 30min body massage.
The foot massage was really relaxing. One point I found strange was they didn't have any clothes to change, and told me to take my pants off (they gave me a towel to cover my body). Then we moved to the body massage. The guy told me to take off all clothes including underwear (in Chinese). Well if I knew I had to be completely naked, I would've wanted to have a female technician...

Here are the bigger problems I had:
1. The guy who gave me massage spoke NO ENGLISH, other than just one word ""okay"". I wasn't too worried in the beginning as usually at places like this, they knew basic massage related words. But not this guy. Not even words like ""strong"", ""soft"", or ""weak"".

When I asked him to soften the pressure, he obviously didn't understand, said something in Chinese, and made it harder. I tried to use different words to explain, but he got frustrated and raised his voice abruptly saying ""OK OK OK!"". It already was awkward being naked in a small room with a man. I stopped explaining and just wished the time would pass quickly.

2. After the massage, the cashier told me the price is $45, but when I paid with a credit card, it came out $50.85. When I asked him, he just said ""Yeah, plus tax"". Well you just told me that it's $45 one second ago. When I made booking I also had confirmed the final price. I think they are one of those sketchy places that hide sales and don't pay taxes. I didn't even pursue it as I just wanted to go home asap.

Honestly, a service with lack of ability to meet basic massage needs and not being upfront about the price isn't worth $50."
Negative	Things have changed here, went back several times for my beloved Caprese salad and was disappointed each time. The bread wasn't crusty, the tomatoes weren't warm and the ingredients were just slopped on the plate. The first time was it artfully prepared with attention to detail, since then it's been thrown together like an afterthought. I have given up hoping that the first plate was the standard rather than the exception. Too bad
Negative	I paid for a 55 minute pedicure and it was only 45 minutes. I could have used the extra few minutes on my massage or calluses. To be honest the chop shop I go to does a better job for half the price. The ambiance is nice though. The salon has a clever way of automatically putting 20 percent towards their tip so if you don't believe your service is worth this much you have to tell them to make an adjustment.
Negative	I was super excited about staying here. our honeymoon was going to be awesome we got a suit and.... let me tell you i dont think i will be coming back! never in my life has some random person opened my hotel room! I mean i havent stayed any many hotels but if small ones are more careful then this place it says alot. it was like 8 am on a tuesday that someone knocking on our room woke me up. since no one answered obviously me and my husband were asleep the guy that by the way did not work there opened our room!!! a stranger had the key to our room my husband got up and went after him to see if it was an employee and he wasnt he was wearing street clothes. and when he went down to complain all they did was change our room key! what if i would of been in the room alone! never again MGM. i had an awesome time but that was just not right. i loved your pool and your customer service but i doubt that we will be back.
Negative	So I ordered a black bean veggie burrito, chips, and a drink and paid extra for a side of sour cream.  I was told sour cream was on the burrito.  It was not.  Service was slow, it was lunch, and the table I sat at had not be bused.  The burrito and ingredients and cheese tasted great, but there was a lack of any veggies except for a couple of table spoons of sautéed veggies.  When I am paying $11.00 for a burrito combo I expect more.  Am I paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here? I can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around.  Parking sucks here.
Negative	I had a good time, but I think the $10 fee was a bit excessive because you had to buy the food, as well.  Now if it included food coins, that would be a different story.
Negative	"We have gone here multiple times but this last time wasn't spectacular. We were about half way through our meal before they took our drink order (and my husband had to go find someone). I then ordered some sushi...just a California roll and something known as a New Jersey roll which was described as crab and asparagus. When I went to go get it, the sushi chef pointed at a plate with a California roll and a crab roll (no asparagus). He asked me, ""California roll and crab roll?""  I replied, ""no, California roll and New Jersey roll"". He then threw a stalk of asparagus on the plate and gave it to me. Are you serious? I can't make this stuff up and had to take a photo. We may have to rethink our restaurant choices."
Negative	"Perhaps the problem was it was New Year's Day.  But our experience was not a good - and I likely wouldn't go back to try again! 

First - the service -- slow - inattentive and at times just missing.  
Second - the food.  Start with the chips.  $9 for some guacamole and chips?  The dip and salsa were good but 25 chips?  Come on!!  You ask why didn't I request more:   I WOULD have done if our server ever returned!  

The entree I had was fish, clams and mussels.  OK -- but someone dropped the red pepper in there!  I LOVE hot food -- but this hot in a fish dish?  The other two entrees were OK -- not exceptional.

The waitress came by fleetingly just after the food arrived and asked if all was well.  As we hadn't even taken a bite, there was not much to say.  But she didn't come back until the entrees were finished.  She then refilled my drink which had been empty for 10 minutes.  

Then we were asked would you like to see the desert menu --to which I replied ""yes please""  It was delivered in 5 minutes - but it was at LEAST another 10 minutes before she returned to take our orders.  At that point, I just wanted to leave!

So marginal food and poor service.  Either one I might have given it a second chance - but with both of those in one meal - and so many other good places to spend $110 for dinner for three (no wine) -- I think not!"
Negative	Went there a year ago, first and last time being there. Food was good. However, besides another group of 2, my gf and I were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 20 minutes to get a menu and 1 hour before our food arrived. We felt invisible to the server and when we didn't tip him, he seemed to be offended, you could tell by his facial expression when he looked at the receipt and how he quietly hurried us out. Seriously though, how long does it take to serve an empty restaurant? It wasn't busy that evening at all.
Negative	Villa Madina restaurant is the worst ! Horrrrrible service and food.  The first time I ate there right away the young man taking my order gave me such an attitude and looked like he didn't give a shit.  I took it with a grain of salt because it was around closing time so I let it go. Got the falafel plate and my gosh it was so freaking dry. He's lucky I ate it at home because I wouldn't complained to the manager. His attitude and the food. I tried today again and ordered the same thing and guess what the same guy was servicing me with the same attitude and his buddy was there too . Oh and to top it off he was on the phone while I was standing there waiting for him to get off. He didn't even apologize .. just kept talking on his phone. Got my order and this time I got a pita... which I've never got before.. anyway, i ate at the redtaurant and good thing that i did because the falafel was so hard I couldn't even put my fork in it. I complained and in front of other customers because I wanted them to know how bad it was. He acted like he cared , didn't fool me he was clearly doing that because there were customers there. Anyway got a new plate with three extra falafels but I still wasn't happy because they forgot to put the hummus. I asked him why didn't I get it and he said it's extra? Wtf?  I told him that I usually get it when I order the falafel plate and he said that he put it the first time then accused me of eating it. Never again will I go to that restaurant.  The one in markville mall so far is my favorite.  Although they've never given me a pita bread... the falafels are good there. Pissed me off. two guys Pissed me off. One that's kind of dark and little chubby and one with a short beard. ( beard guy looked like he was high on something ) pricks!
Negative	"This place is the worst!!!!  The only thing worth it is the homemade grisssini.  

The fettuccine Alfredo looked like it came from olive garden, very dull and bland.  I ordered the steak special and for $65 I received a steak that was ok, not great, barely ok and a blob of something they called garlic rosemary mashed potatoes.  No way, it had NO FLAVOR!!!!!

The creme brûlée was weepy and watery and the only good part was the wonderful  berries on top!!!  

Save your money, this place is not cheap and there are MANY other options you can choose from.  One worth pursuing is the steak place in NY NY......"
Negative	"In the super competitive world of breakfast restaurants, there really is no shortage of choice in the Montreal area.
Oeufs & Cie offers a mix of everything and does nothing special.

Since the other breakfast joint in dix 30 ""Allo Mon Coco"" is always full on weekends, we opted for this place and were seated very quickly. Although it is not an old restaurant, the sign and interior decor/colors looks drab. There is vomit green paint on the walls that I really do not find appealing and half the restaurant is in a closed off, dark area with no windows. Unfortunately that is where we were seated and it didn't help the experience. The walls are not only of an ugly color but they are tons of scuff marks and scratches.

As for the food, I ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, ham, bacon, toast and potatoes and my partner had a breakfast casserole. The portion is average however the cut of ham and bacon are paper thin as another reviewer commented on.
I was expecting a thicker breakfast style ham but was served 1 slice of black forrest thin deli meat. The bacon also looked liked the microwavable type.

Service was slow, our server came only once after half an hour to refill coffee and really there was nothing oustanding about the food. It wasn't awful nor great, just OK.

I wouldn't come back mostly because I find the place so depressing. You do not want to start your day here."
Negative	"We were all in the mood for Dim Sum and decided to come to Chang's cause I've been here a bunch of times and it's always been good. Parking was easy as it wasn't busy, usually it's packed and I'll tell you why in a sec. It's on Decatur just north of Tropciana. Not far behind the Home Depot. 

The only reason I've giving this place 1 star is cause of the shitty customer service. Their website clearly states they do Dim Sum till 10:30pm. We came in and sat down looked over the menu for about 15 minutes while we drank our tea. We tell our server were going to do Dim Sum and he says no dim sum today because the cook left early. WTF!? That is the only reason why we came here and thier website says they serve it till 10:30pm!

What's worse is they didn't tell us when we came in we sat there wasting our time. It crappie when this is what your known for and you don't have it. When I told the server about it and what their website says he looked at me like I was from Pluto. Won't be coming back for awhile, was quite disturbed."
Negative	"I really hate that I am giving such a bad review based off of one person but I am.  First let me say the boutique is beautiful, the clothing and accessories are top notch.  I got my eyebrows done by Hadiya (Nadia with an H) and she was wonderful and did an excellent job - HOWEVER the receptionist or manager (I don't know which she is) has the WORST attitude that I have ever received from someone that does face to face customer service.  She was short with EVERYONE that came to check in or ask about getting an appointment!!  People would ask her the simplest question and she would act as if they were bothering her.  I went up to pay and asked her if I could make an appointment she turned around walked away and said one second, well it was substantially longer so I told another employee that I would just call to make the appointment, she came walking back out - MOUTH FULL of food and I said ""I am late for another...""  she CUT ME OFF mid sentence and said ""I said I would be right back!  I mean I had something to do for my boss!"" Yea - your boss told you to go in the back and shove some food in your mouth""  So I told her I would just call and make the appointment from the car...she rolls her eyes at me and turns her back.  It is a shame that one idiot can ruin such an otherwise excellent experience."
Negative	Slowest drive thru ever. Staff didn't know how to work the computer. Never will be back here again. Now I'm late for work. My entire order was wrong. Wrong nuggets, wrong sandwich and wrong drink x2. Jamie should be fired.
Negative	"So I scheduled an appointment ""TO
TOUR THE SCHOOL"". Bellamy, was who I was to meet with. So I get there a few before 9:00 and wait for her. She comes in and introduces herself and walks in her office so I am left wondering ""do I follow orrr no"" when another lady says ""you can go in"" so I go in and sit. She pulls out some papers (Bellamy) and says welcome back and ""I know you have seen these papers before.."" And I sort of stopped her and say ""this is my first time ever being here."" She says oh okay and starts handing me paperwork for cosmetology, I say ""um I am here for the skin care program"". I stayed calm and sweet but that is a little frustrating that she has no idea who or why I am here even after talking back and forth and setting up a tour meeting. So she gets out the correct paperwork and has me start filling things out (I'm assuming they just need it for filing purposes) and then she tells me I need to fill out the fasfa, mind you I have mentioned to her and another lady sitting in the room that I was there for a TOUR! So whatever I sit at the computer and start filling it out and she asks if I have my high school diploma on hand, no I don't. So I keep filling this out online and get to the tax portion.. I'm sorry but if anyone can remember tax info off the top of their head, props to you! So I tell her sorry I can't finish this without my tax forms. She kinda just stood there not saying anything so I got up and say in the other car infront of the desk and she asks if I have my diploma on hand (again) along with my social and Id I said I have my id but nothing else. At this point I am getting frustrated but remaining very professional and collected. Bellamy seemed a bit turned off that I didn't have those things and says ""well yeah cause we need them to make copies"". I said well I don't have them. So she hands me a paper to sign and does not tell me what it is!! (Still haven't take a tour) then she points to the paper and says my $100 registration fee is due today. I said ""no I'm not here to do this today I am here for a tour. She looked confused or lost and finally says okay let's do the tour.

The tour included a one minute walk around the school. I literally had to ask ""what is this room"" as she walked past the room with all the skin care tables. I literally had to ask ""so is this where we take clients or?"". Why am I asking?! It's a tour and I should be getting a tour and description of everything! Not to mention the student kit you pay $350 for, I was only shown the brushes. 

So, to be honest, my feelings for the skin care program at all are completely turned off. I don't think I'll be returning here for sure. 

I felt she was very unprepared and unprofessional. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable and awkward. Honestly it was a complete waste of time. An hour I was there for nothing. 

Tip: when someone has an appointment with you take a second to re read what they are coming for so you don't make them feel completely unwelcome.

A plus side, the school was clean and looked really nice, to bad.



I just learned Carl was the women sitting in with me and Bellamy and I am shocked to learn she was the OWNER. And let it run as it did. ""/"
Negative	"I used PV Postal for the first time to ship some items I'd bought online from the Phoenix area. I told them the items were antiques, and fragile, suggesting they consider shipping the items in separate boxes, as the items knocking against each other could get damaged. I was assured they would be well packed and not worth the extra money to ship separately. Anyways, I received my items, and boy were they poorly packed. One layer of bubble wrap around each, and not even taped to ensure the item stayed wrapped. A handful of packing peanuts had been placed in, providing almost no value. When I opened the package two items were out of the bubble wrap. Honestly, looking at it made me wonder how they survived the cross country trip. 

I won't use them again if I have business in the area."
Negative	HEY EVERYONE, BIG WARNING! IF YOU ORDER A HOT DRINK, BE SURE THE DAMN THING IS FULL! I went to get my coffee this morning and I ordered a venti but they filled it as if it was a Grande. Circle k will be opening right next door soon. it looks like $1.75 coffee is in my future.
Negative	I went to their Pan Asian buffet for dinner and it was disappointing, the only thing going for them was the Sashimi. The hot entrees was really not worth eating, shrimp was way over cooked and the crab claws were dry. The Vietnamese Pho was not hot and bland, the desserts were mostly squares and cookies and pies of course they also have a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit. All in all it was not great. We went with 8 people and we ate a lot of sashimi and for some it was not worth it at all. Choices are slim and just to much BBQ meat stuff that are dried out and flavor lacking. If you just want to go somewhere and gorge go to Greg Eagle. If you want good tasty quality food go somewhere else.
Negative	"How enchanting.
A brown bag of french fries that before I can whisk them off to my table, has already saturated the bag with grease.
And a double cheeseburger that after only two bites has fallen apart.

I do like the soda dispenser, very unique, almost futuristic in a sense.

In the end, If I want to spend twenty five bucks for lunch for two of us, I'll go someplace where I'm not ingesting a half bucket of grease in the process. 

Note:  
Don't go here before going to the movies. Your  body's grease-o-meter will be hitting red line, making you think twice about that bag of buttered popcorn.

Or who knows, maybe you like grease.
Not me."
Negative	"This is unfortunate..bit into a bone in my chicken sandwich. This is 7 years after trying this place when I bit into sharp fish skin on the tuna sandwich. Should've had a burger maybe but I don't believe I'll be going back.
Picture included"
Negative	"Sadly, I have nothing positive to say about our dining experience here. 

The dining area smelled like smoke (the door was open and there were smokers eating nearby on the outdoor patio).

We waited 10 minutes just for the waiter to acknowledge us. Waited another 35 minutes for our food (no exaggeration -- I was timing it and almost walked out).

When the food finally came, I could only take a few bites before I started to get nauseous. As soon as I'm done with this review, I'm looking for a bottle of Pepto-Bismol.

They could definitely stand to make their service a little more efficient and their menu a little more digestible."
Negative	Bad!!!  We made reservations only to show up and had to wait an additional 30 minutes because they sat a party at our table 2 hours prior to our arrival and they were waiting for them to leave.  Finally got seated, ordered drinks which took forever.  Coffee was served cold.  Came back to take our food order.  Ordered appetizers which again took forever.  Never came back to refill drinks until we flagged them down.  Food came and part of the order was wrong.  Very disappointing.  We will never be going back here.
Negative	"The owner/manager or whoever he is does not like serving African Americans. I would always order papusas. Took my friend there to try something new. We got ceviche, papusas and lemonade. My friend didn't care for the food so a waiter asked if he wanted something else instead and he said no it was okay, he just doesn't want it. He barely took a bite of it. She brings the check and still charged him which he didn't want to pay for something he didn't like and literally didn't eat. The manager came out with an attitude like we're a small market and we can't afford to give out feee food. Offended AF I said nobody is asking for anything free we're sinoky asking for customer service which you clearly don't have and that I'll take care of the entire tab. As I get up and I pulled out cash that I am counting, he comes back up to me and says. Are you gonna pay or not? And that's my thing with you people if you wanted fried chicken you could've gone somewhere else! 

I said you people! ohh that's what it is? You're a racist piece of Shit and you think we're looking for a handout. F* you and this tab.  He then look shock and tried to defend his racist comment. Me and my friend left and will never be back. It's sad because they're also a minority and I would've never expected them to be so disgusting!"
Negative	"I wish there was a way here to give it zero stars. I've never had a worse customer experience than I did with Guardian. This is company is focused on collecting money through contractual obligations, not in building a brand around valuable products and customer service.

Several months ago, a sales representative from Guardian Protection Services presented me with a contract for home security services while I was in the process of building a new home, as a part of a business agreement they have with my home builder. He set the expectation that the commitment was risk-free because I could change my selections or cancel the service at any time. The product features were the focus of the conversation, not the contract terms. I certainly was not made aware of any multi-year obligations or early termination fees. Pre-wiring for the security system was completed as a part of the home construction project. Prior to the hardware installation date, I contacted Guardian by phone to let them know that I didn't want to move forward with installation. The person that I spoke with did not mention at that time that I would be billed for security services anyway. Only a month later, I noticed that Guardian had automatically withdrawn a payment from my bank account, although it never installed a functional system in my home. I had made the assumption that I wouldn't be billed for a system that hadn't been fully implemented. That would be like a cable provider billing someone who is without cable boxes in his or her home. I assumed the initial withdraw was done in error and that it might be corrected once the information that I never completed installation made its way to the billing department. After a second auto payment was withdrawn and I made a second phone call, I realized that I was sadly mistaken. This company fully intends to hold its customers hostage to multi-year contracts, regardless of whether or not they ever implement the system. I was told my only option was to move forward with the installation and contract in its original form or pay a $3000 early termination fee. $3000! As point of reference, the monthly fee was $54.95. I spoke with three different Guardian employees over the past three weeks, one of which was a supervisor, and was sadly disappointed to learn that all employees have been trained to only discuss the terms of contractual agreements, regardless of whether or not any services have actually been provided. I am greatly concerned that this company intends to bill for services it has never actually provided and cannot imagine how they are able to recognize revenue in accordance with GAAP accounting principles. Most of all, I am disappointed by the lack of respect as a potential loyal client and as a human being. I feel that the sales person gave me the bait and switch approach during my home buying experience by setting a false expectation that I could change my mind at any time, which I later learned was a $3000 error. In the way that its employees have approached this situation, Guardian has jeopardized the likelihood that I would ever move forward with implementing their security services or recommend that a friend or fellow home builder work with them."
Negative	DR PEMA NEGLIGENCE HAS COST ME $10000.00.  DO NOT GO! Dr Pema not only tried several times to do partial implant dentures which should have 4-6 screws on top and bottom but only did 2 on each totaling 4 with a 40% rejection rate which did not work but was not available other than 2 days a week.  A refund was requested and I have submitted a claim to the dental board examiners.  He also demanded payment upfront and when I requested a refund of my moneys he had me sign a refund agreement which contained the fact that I could not sue him for malpractice.  I was under the impression that I was only signing for a refund not waiving my right to malpractice.
Negative	The jury is still out on this place. Was curious about this place so me and the wifey checked it out. A little pricey I thought, but luckily I checked in through yelp and got the free garlic knots with a 20 dollar purchase! Pizza was decent but the garlic knots were bomb! Heard about their 40 cent wing tuesdays so that will my next adventure. Until then 2 stars will do. I will consider my rating once the second visit is complete.
Negative	The WORST customer service experience I have ever been through. Management does not take responsibility for any mistakes made. The communication in house with employees is terrible, let alone the warehouse. They give you a 10 hour delivery window for your delivery. What makes things worst is they DID NOT DELIVER ALL OF MY FURNITURE. So you know what that means.. You guessed it, I have to make myself available for ANOTHER day with ANOTHER 10 hour window a complete waste of time. Don't expect management to take care of the issue, Victor the store manager will avoid you and speak through the receptionist to relay a message. Not to mention in order to get that message you will have to call back in they will not call you. Let's take it to the next level... Spoke with the DM Mark, don't expect him to save the day he will also give you the run around and tell you how they cannot compensate you for your time that was wasted and you can NEVER get back. I wouldn't refer my WORST enemy to this place. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!! Go to Mod Furniture, or The Dump to mention a few, there are PLENTY of stores in the area that are way better than this place. There is a reason why this place only has 2 stars on yelp pay attention.
Negative	Beer's cold, problem is the 2 times I've been there so too has the service.  Sometimes you need a cheap Mexican food fix and this is the place for it.  This place is IN Mandalay Place..... I'd suggest spending the extra couple of bucks on food at Border Grill in Mandalay Bay for more upscale and flavorful Mexican cuisine.
Negative	Worst experience with traveling I've ever had. I had booked a ticket from MTL to NYC days in advance with train tickets, show tickets and hotel rooms all booked after my bus ticket was bought. I get to the bus station with all my luggage to learn that the bus was not delayed but CANCELLED with no prior warning. I did not receive a text or call or email to inform me of the cancellation. Then when I proceeded to request for a refund, the gate agent kept directing me to the website which is just absolute shit. I'm on a student budget and have lost a lot of money on my just the ticket but everything else that was lined up based on me getting to NYC. I have emailed them multiple times regarding a refund and haven't heard anything back. When I called, I was put on hold for almost 40 minutes just to be hung up on. Never ever am I going to use their service. I recommend Amtrak as the best alternative for transportation to NY.
Negative	Awesome beer selection, but crappy food. I came here with a group of co-workers and everyone thought their meal was mediocre, at best. It was disappointing to see such a poor selection of vegetarian options. Sorry, but a salad just doesn't cut it for me.
Negative	I've dined here a few times now, so I can finally say I'm just not fan. My BF loves his sports, so we always sit at the bar. Our bartenders have always been friendly and attentive, so the stars go off to them. But the chicken wings, which Hooters is famous for, are just not good. They aren't cooked enough because the meat near the bone is still pink. I shouldn't have to say well done on my wings for a place that specializes in wings. There are always little feathers that are still left on. Not appetizing at all. And the breading on them is just too thick. I will definitely not be back because I can make chicken wings in my own kitchen much better than this place.
Negative	"I went in to make a cash deal on a car yesterday. The young(wet behind ears) salesman apparently did not understand what ""out the door ""price meant. I told him several times ""out the door?"" He came back with the price Plus doc fee,tax etc. We immediately left. I hate wasting my time. The sales manager followed us out. I told him to Fuck off. He wasn't impressed and told me to get the Fuck out of here. I later received a text from the salesman chastising me for my language. Too funny coming from a used car salesman. I will never do business with them. Id give them a zero if I could."
Negative	Worst nail job I've had in my life. Didn't do what I asked and began chipping off next day. The actual nail not just the polish. Then even after I went back in and requested them to fix them my nails (it's been 4 days) have began cracking. There is bubbles in them. Horrible:( and a waste of mula to go here.
Negative	"Crossover! 

Not a great place to find any woman clothing, but you'll find everything for the guys. Quite disappointed in their shoe collection. They have everything you can find at every other shoe store. 

Whenever my friends and I pop in here for a visit, the workers are either hitting on me or on my friends. Very professional. Workers are too busy on their iPhones texting or changing the music playing in the store."
Negative	"These people are MORONS! They screwed up my meal by telling me that they could make something they couldn't and wouldn't replace It, even with something cheaper. They just sat there arguing about how they didn't say yes when they clearly did (or else I wouldn't have paid them). 

Seriously, the are Filiberto's all over so pick a different one, these people suck.

Oh and if you are the moronic manager I spoke to and you happen to read this, take offense because you suck!"
Negative	I went here yesterday. Their goat cheese pizza is really good and I ordered the calamari which is okay but it was just extremely greasy. The red sauce that came with it was literally frozen. I asked for another red sauce and the new one they gave me was frozen as well like what. Their service isn't the best either with their waitresses not being the nicest.
Negative	"I went here for lunch with my friend and her boyfriend.  We went because none us had been there before and we wanted to sit outside.  None of us were really struck by anything on the menu, there was a just a weird variety of choices.  I went in wanting a salad because it was hot out, but the large salad was 8 or 9 dollars, and it is 4 dollars to add chicken to that.  Too much in my opinion (and granted healthier options do tend to cost more).  My friend and I ended up getting the burger and her boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwiches come with a side salad or coleslaw and we all opted for the salad because if you want fries that will cost you an extra 3 dollars (half the price of my burger).  Again ridiculous. Our burgers were fine, not bad, not great.  The menu said they were served on a pretzel roll, and neither of our rolls seemed at all pretzel-y.  The side salad was pretty pathetic, it was shredded lettuce and big chunks of onion.  It made me glad I didn't order a large salad. 
The BBQ pork was supposed to come with coleslaw on the sandwich, but since my friend wanted the side salad they didn't give him the coleslaw that was supposed to come on the sandwich.  Our waitress was nice about getting him the coleslaw and explained that the kitchen doesn't put coleslaw on the sandwich (that the menu says comes with coleslaw on it) if the person gets the side salad rather than the side of coleslaw.  She said that she has to specify to the kitchen whether or not they want coleslaw on the sandwich and whether or not they want coleslaw or a salad on the side as well.  Makes things more complicated than necessary.  If you want to drink Capital beer pick some up at the grocery store and skip this place."
Negative	I had the old dirty clucker which was almost 16 dollars it was good with the dirty sauce and quite big but the deal you get at stockyards is way better and I believe stocyards chciken  waffles taste alot better as well. The chciken is tender here and the sauce is good but I don't know there is still something missing
Negative	Waited at the drive thru for 10 minutes and no one took my order. There were multiple people in Lin waiting. A car got his order right before I got there. I called the number and no one answered. This isn't the first time this has happened.
Negative	"I signed up for a yelp account JUST to save other people from going to this place. We had to go LOOK for a server to get his attention. The pizza here was awful, which means you're screwed because there's basically nothing else on the menu. This restaurant is also very tiny and.has limited seating and is far from the main drag. ...the two friends I was with also said their pizza was poor. One of them described their pizza crust as ""tasting like charcoal."" ...the beer was okay, except we went for dinner. Perhaps the other reviewers drank a little too much before posting their thoughts."
Negative	The worst customer service ever!  Male workers flirting with female customers and ignoring the next people in line! Very unprofessional male techs who are lazy.  Not a good representation of AT&T service! Quite embarrassed to be an AT&T customer!
Negative	"I like the space here, the lunch hustle and bustle, and the amazing bread, but 2.5 stars overall for food.

I had the half cup soup, half sandwich (roasted veggie). The artichoke pesto was tasty and the veggies were pretty decent. The couscous and soup were just okay though -- flavors weren't mind-blowing. Just a nice sandwich hang out shop if you need to grab a quick bite."
Negative	Only fly this airline if you have a VERY open schedule and you don't mind spending hours sitting in small airports while they fix your plane.  We flew from Mesa to Pasco- they switched our plane with a flight to Eugene that was 5 hours delayed and then our replacement plane had a blow out which went from a simple tire change to a 2 1/2 hour brake repair.  We were nearly 3 hours late arriving and missed the opening activity of the event we were flying in for - in the future we will fly a major reputable airline that maintains it's fleet into Seattle and drive for 3 hours - a much better option than putting our lives in the hands of a subpar airline who doesn't realize the importance of maintaing schedules.
Negative	"This Motel 6 is a bit run down so I will start with the positives:
1. The price, it's cheap.
2. Pet friendly.
3.The staff were friendly and even offered some discounts that weren't offered through the travel site we booked the motel on getting us a cheaper rate also let us check in a little earlier than 3pm.
4. It's close (less than 1 block away) from a convenience store.  

Now for the not so great part.. the negatives:
1. The room which was non smoking smelt like cigarettes.
2. The room cleanliness was not up to par. There was hair in the tub, the counters, on the floor and even had one of those legendary curly hairs in the bed.
3. The parking lot has limited spaces on the side we stayed on, except for handicap spots those were plentiful. The lot by the lobby is at a terrible incline causing cars with lower ground clearance to scrape.
4. The walkways were pretty gross, trash left around, old gum on the ground stuff like that. 
5. The smell of marijuana is overwhelming outside. People will just hold their cigarette outside their doors so they weren't smoking in their rooms.
6. Rooms have little to no sound proofing. Our room was by an ice machine which sounded like it was inside the room. 

I probably won't come back to this hotel when I visit Tempe again."
Negative	"Went there for lunch last week and the sushi was par at best. 

I can't recommend this place and wouldn't go back.

Sorry. Was excited to try it but it was a complete let down.

For all of those ""five star"" reviews I suggest that you search out a truly fantastic sushi place. Thus, if you were ""blown away"" by Ichi Ban then you're going to completely explode when you taste what sushi should taste like.

Best of luck."
Negative	Tried to charge me $5.50 for a drink that was $3.45 and they told me it's because I substituted milk for almond milk. They then talked to me like I was an idiot telling me how I was wrong. I've been to that location plenty of times and have gotten the same drink for $3.45. Adding almond milk is a $.60 charge anyway.
Negative	"RENTING FROM REBEL PLACE IS A SCAM

Management doesn't care about anything except taking your money. I lived on the first floor for 3 years and we had multiple break in attempts. The only reason they weren't actual break ins was because we were home both times and were able to scare them away by turning on lights and making noise. We reported them to management who said they would replace the windows but couldn't do anything about the security issue. 

We also had a HEART left on our doorstep. We called management, who said it wasn't their problem... ended up calling the police, who connected us to 911, and management still ignored the issue. 

Upon move out they kept my deposit and charged me an extra $200 to ""paint"" my bedroom, even though it was exponentially cleaner than when I moved in. They don't clean anything before you move in - if you have absolutely no option but to live here I highly recommend renting a carpet cleaner. 

PLEASE do yourself a favor and don't live here. They will steal every penny they can from you and let you live in disgusting, dangerous conditions."
Negative	"Not rude but certainly not friendly service. Had to look around for coffee refills more than once. Manager dismissed my comment that food took a long time. Bottled ketchup an uninspired accompaniment to potatoes for $26. One of my poached eggs was missing a yolk. 
All in all nothing special and rather expensive for that experience."
Negative	She overcharged me. I tried to tell her but she insisted she was right. The board and the order form both disagree with her. I didn't feel like arguing over $1. Be prepared to overpay or argue.
Negative	"Disappointed in my first time at this location. I ordered an order to go and it was totally screwed up from the beginning.  I also will add that I walked in at 4 pm and there was one other person in the whole place. I placed my order and then asked for her to repeat it back to me as my wife is gluten intolerant. She repeated it back and she had chili cheese fries instead of the plain thick fries, and forgot to add a gluten free bun burger with no mayo or mustard rather than the regular bun for one of two burgers. She corrected it and I thought all was good. I took the order home and when we opened up the bag we found the burgers to be both reg cheeseburgers( one not gluten free ) and also had the chili cheese fries rather than the plain thick fries.
So we had to throw out the one burger and the greasy, sloppy looking chili cheese fries. Am taking Fat Burgers off my list of burger joints to patronize"
Negative	Staff was friendly, sandwich was good. Store was filthy!! Every table was dirty and crumbs on the chairs. The floor was even worse. Looks like it hadn't been swept or mopped in days. The bathrooms weren't the cleanest either. Don't think I'll come back to this location.
Negative	Service and quality going down. Won't be returning anymore. Tempura was cold and overcooked. Literally 4 strips of chicken katsu. Seemed they were being stingy with providing green tea (the actual pot), I mean..if I'm paying 2.00 for green tea, give me the pot and not just the little cup. Guess I have to find a new sushi joint with good service.
Negative	"Yes; this place is 100% hype. But I definitely approached The Cheesecake Factory with zero expectations and as someone who has never experienced it before. I was glad I didn't have to wait more than 10mins on a Friday afternoon during lunch which contrasted the hour long waits that had happened during opening month. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was good and fried perfectly. But the sauces that came with it were another story; a terrible store-bought cocktail sauce and an overly creamy garlic dip that tasted like mayo and a bit of diced garlic. Terrible. Our entrees - fettuccine alfredo and fish tacos - continued to disappoint. The alfredo was absurdly salty and has a chunky texture that I couldn't stomach. The will flavour of that dish was salt. The fried fish in the tacos was good, but the topping were lacking and the spicy aioli had a similar texture to the calamari dip which was terrible. To be honest, the only real redeeming thing is the cheesecake. We had gotten the raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake which was honestly really good! The housemade cream on top was good and the raspberry flavour was prominent but didn't overwhelm the white chocolate. 

Overall, I get the hype but I don't. It's nice when new establishments from the US reach Canada, but don't let that be the end all of whether an establishment is good. My review gets worse cause I got straight up food poisoning after my visit. Maybe it was just my immune system, but maybe it was the food. Service was great; super friendly! But my impression on the Cheesecake Factory is low due to the mediocre food at relatively higher prices, and for not a super amazing dining experience."
Negative	"Cleanliness - 5 stars
Fabulous touch with the mimosa - 5 stars
Staff - 1 Star
Unfortunately only a handful of staff are personable and friendly and I didn't get one of those friendly faces. My tech had a scowl on her face the entire time. When she was scrubbing my feet, I jumped because I'm ticklish...she gave the dirtiest look, not once but four times. I even said at one point, ""it's obvious you are annoyed with me but what you are doing tickles"". That ruined the visit. For the remainder of the time, I kept catching her staring at me with not a pleasant look. In the middle of the appointment she got missing for quite some time. 
Additionally, I was not that pleased with the outcome of my nails. She asked if I wanted to cut my nails but never asked how short. She butchered them. The only time she was nice and personable was during payment.

I have been searching for a clean salon in the Matthews area and with the reviews here I thought I'd found it. But I believe in customer service and the people who work for you represent you...good and bad. I was very unimpressed with my tech. Because of that, this will not be a place that pops in my head when I think of a place to get a mani/pedi."
Negative	"I originally purchased ownership at this location in 2005. Back then, when an Owner booked a room here, they were given a ""Welcome Gift"" upon check-in that included things like a travel size toothpaste, a ladies razor, mints, floss, coupons for shopping and dining and sometimes even a hat. Also included was a 10% discount for the Marketplace located on the 1st floor, which comes in handy if you forgot something or wanted to pick up a quick sandwich instead of going out to eat since there is nothing really close by if you're in a hurry.

Now your ""Welcome Gift"" consists of some coupons for dining at the Las Vegas Hilton, coupons for the Harrah's properties, shopping discounts for Macy's, a discount or free appetizer (I can't remember) for Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville and Planet Hollywood Restaurant. None of which were of any use to me. Toothpaste, I can always use. Also no longer offered? Any sort of discount at the ONLY place inside the property to get food, drinks, etc. Zip. Zilch. Nada. 

Really? I've dumped THOUSANDS of dollars into this place already and I can't even get a measly 10% off of a deli sandwich after a 5-hour drive to get here? Are you f'ing kidding me?

Also, if I tell the Agent when I book the reservation that I don't want to attend a presentation during my stay, I expect NOT to be asked repeatedly to attend. Three ""No's"" during the initial conversation, coupled with three ""No's"" when I checked in, compounded by another two ""No's"" after checking in when an Agent called my room is not acceptable. NO means NO.

When I get inside the room, I feel at home. I wish my apartment was this nice, but the aggravation that goes along with ""ownership"" is beyond annoying. I'm now debating selling."
Negative	"Let me first start by saying I am a loyal customer here. I have been coming here for the last two years! The service seems to be going downhill. I drove up this morning to get ultimate wash and was greeted by Simon. The customer service was absolutely unacceptable! The guy told me I could pull forward to the vacuum area, unless I didn't want my car to be vacuumed. Why would I come to the car wash and not have my car vacuumed? He tried to sell me a wax on a car that they just waxed two weeks ago..? Then once I mentioned they had just done it, he quickly said it wasn't necessary. When I came inside to pay the cashier, Simon walked in after me and was talking about me to the cashier (not so discreetly). I will no longer be coming to this car wash. 
I would give this car wash and the employees no stars but that was not an option so I'll settle for the one."
Negative	"Not a whole lot of natural foods. Did I miss something? Is there another room somewhere?

They have lots of dog food and herbs/spices but as far as food for humans goes it seems they have about 2 rows worth of gluten free items, and thats about it. They also have refrigerated sections which I did not browse.

Lots of special vitamins and oils but not much else."
Negative	"Checked out Mr. Guo for the first time on Saturday afternoon with the family. We normally go to Snow Palace (the previous owners) but decided to check the new place out for lunch. 

Big mistake. 

Once inside, we were greeted by an extremely dirty restaurant. Listen, we go to tons of ethnic restaurants and I get how sometimes they may not be as ""clean"" but this was alarmingly dirty. We were surrounded by tables with food and drinks from the previous night. Bottles of beer bottles, lobster shells on the floor and flies - both fruit flies and the black ones were swarming around. What was crazy is that the place wasn't even busy. We were the only ones in the restaurant at 12:30pm. 

The waitress/owner? that greeted us just sat behind the cash register and never lifted a finger to clean up all the dirty tables. The place smelled, the napkins at our table looked used and the bowls had a film of grease on it. As i cast my gaze towards the kitchen, I spotted the trolley of used dishes and yes ... They were full of dirty dishes with old food in the them. 

The lack of cleanliness made us quite doubtful of the kitchen and food preparation. We decided to order ... and made a bad mistake of not leaving immediately. 

Mr. Guo's menu is humongous with many traditional Chinese dishes. The problem is that the spelling in the menu is horrendous and not descriptive of what you're actually going to get (unless you read Chinese). The waitress/owner was no help as her English was quite poor. 

Our congee came out in a slimy consistency. Even worse, it had the residual taste of mutton (also on the menu). I suspect cross contamination with uncleaned pots and cooking utensils. Congee with the musky taste of mutton ... is just disgusting. 

The spicey beef dish was passable but was loaded with MSG. The only thing that was remotely decent was the steamed buns with condense milk. 

Folks - we're banning this place. What a waste of money and time. Establishments like this should not even be allowed to open. We were totally disgusted with the experience."
Negative	"Sorry, but this place does not live up to the ""DDD Guy F"" show.  I ordered off of the ""Featured DDD menu"", spicy gumbo type dish and my wife ordered the shrimp and grits.  All of the seafood was sub-standard, very small pieces of seafood, mini shrimp, mini scallops, I couldn't even tell they were scallops because they were so small. Shrimp and grits was super oily and had way too many pineapples in it, it stated it came with jumbo shrimp, NOT! It came with the super tiny frozen shrimp you buy from Wally World. And sorry, the cornbread was terrible.   The service was terrible, people walking around not doing anything, 1 guy working, three girls just walking around aimlessly. 

Please take down the ""DDD"" poster in your restaurant, if you're not going to make the food like you did in the show, if you're going to cheap out, then don't claim it on your menu and on your wall. People come to your place because of the show."
Negative	"Grab and go should be grab and go.  We ordered at the Grab and Go window and when she finally called our number after 2 customers AFTER us already got their food, it wasn't even covered so that we could take it to GO. When we asked her if she had a bag so we can carry the food up to our room, she rudely said,""Well, you could have told us that earlier.""  Lady, it says GRAB AND GO.  If I wasn't going to do that I would have gone inside to sit and eat!  The food was mediocre. Nothing great. I even got the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate and nothing fancy about that one either. Just tastes like every other shake out there.

Perhaps next time I will go inside to see if I get better service and try one of their sundaes. PERHAPS."
Negative	"wow... shady businesses!
who can you trust?   i should have done my due diligence and checked  yelp! and the bbb!

i used a on line service to look for a interstate moving company to bring my niece  back home to california because her dad  has brain cancer.
this company replied to my inquiry about moving her home back  to california. my rep shawn  at 877 500 6683 ext 211 sound professional and legit. he took most of the information i had down and quoted a price to do the job for around $1900.
great i thought, so i told him that my niece would contact him regarding more details of the home.

as they spoke, they did a good ol' fashion switch and bait. the job went all the way up to over 3000. when my niece started to ask questions, they gave her a hard time and then just hung up.....
wtf!!!!

stay away from these guys. bad news!
bbb rated them a ""f"".
i rate my self a ""d"" for not doing my due diligence and a ""s"" for almost being a sucker and getting my family into trouble.

they have several names and numbers. be aware!!! 
stay clear!

Negative	"This has not been a good experience. I started at the Tallmadge location for an eye exam and new glasses. A woman came in, didn't introduce herself or tell me her position, and did my eyes exam for my new glasses. I thought she was the doctor.

Later the doctor comes in, and doesn't introduce himself. 

Two weeks later my glasses arrive. I inform them that the prescription isnt right. They tell me I have to get used to them.

I couldn't even wear the glasses as they gave me an instant headache.

After a few weeks I take them back to the coventry location. They tell me I need no line bifocals. $150 please. I pay it, two weeks later my glasses arrive. The prescription is still wrong. While reading, one eye is blurry and the other is fine. When I focus the blurry eye the clear eye is then blurry. These glasses tire my eyes and give me a headache.

This place is not good. I'm out about $200 and have glasses I can't wear. I won't be back."
Negative	"A few months back my girlfriend and I had been shopping in the market and I was looking for a cup of coffee.  We ventured into Krepesz European Palacsinta Cafe.
 First off I simply can't stand pretentious cafes, and Krepesz certainly falls into that category. If you're going to open a cafe to the public is it too much to ask that you serve drip coffee, not just espresso based drinks. 
My girlfriend ordered a Latte and I went with an Americano.  I don't recall exactly how my girlfriend ordered her Latte, but the server (A 30 plus man with a bald head) debated the creation of the drink with her in a very condescending tone... something along the lines of ""Oh you mean a 'dry' latte, not 'wet' ""...  after a while with that the solution was found.
After we shelled out over $6 for two drinks, my girlfriend asked if they had any cinnamon for her Latte. Again in a rude condescending tone he responded ""No we don't provide cinnamon or other syrups like Starbucks, we want our customers to actually taste our drinks..."" Seriously, It would have been more appropriate to have answered the question politely ""No, I'm sorry we don't""... honestly is it too much to ask for the staff at Krepesz to respect their customers?  Come on you in your 30s and you're serving coffee and crepes, know you role.
I can tell you one think, I'll never step back inside this business ever again, unless I see a sign outside that says ""Under New Non- Pretentious Management""... ha that'll be the day..."
Negative	I was a loyal customer for years, and always thought there food was good. However, I was trying to call in an order when they would not answer. I tried once and was on the phone before I realized no one was answering. I tried again and still no answer. I then tried to order online where the process was confusing and extremely frustrating. They lost a loyal customer.
Negative	THIS REVIEW IS BASED OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF THE EMPLOYEES. So basically we go in to the Planet Hollywood and I stop to ask for directions at the Westgate Kiosk at the Miracle Mile Shops right next to Cabo Wabo, and honestly the Westgate employees could not be more rude & unprofessional. First off, I try to ask one of the men for assistance when I notice he is talking on the phone while on duty, it is because of this that he rudely tells me to ask someone else for assistance & not bother him because he's on the phone, so then I ask one of the women working there and she pretty much says is SO rude to me, she basically said that she didn't feel like helping me and to go away. She pretty much just told me to fuck off. I had not one but TWO employees be completely rude to me when I was just asking for some assistance. Horrible costumer service, I left the Planet Hollywood as soon as possible, if that's how their employees act & that's how they condone their employees to treat guests. The worst part is that I actually filed a complaint against those employees, I even took a picture of them and sent it to management to show them who they were, and Planet Hollywood Management DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. I guess Planet Hollywood doesn't care that their employees mistreat customers & guests. I gladly left the hotel ASAP and have not been back. It's Planet Hollywood's loss, me and my girlfriend were planning on going shopping nonstop at the Miracle Mile Shops, eat at the PF Changs inside the Planet Hollywood, hang out at Koi Lounge, get a snack at the Pin Up Pizza and have my countless of relatives & friends visiting Vegas all stay at the Planet Hollywood. But you can be rest assured that we didn't do any of that and we never are again. We took ALL of our business to the much better Aria & Bellagio across the street.
Negative	"I'd like to start this novel pointing out I'm a Veteran, ASU grad and now hard working Customer Service manager for a company voted # 1 in it's industry for 17 years in a row. It's gonna be a long review here because I was expecting much but I was extremely disappointed all around. I don't typically eat Taco Bell because of mistakes and quality but my boyfriend was craving it and I hadn't had a grilled stuff burrito in years. Cashier was super helpful and apologized when I called in because part of my order was missing. She explained they made the food but it was left on the counter. I hadn't realized as there were a couple orders on the counter. Though I had spent time getting all the to go goodies so there was time to catch it by both parties I accepted it as our fault. But it was all downhill from there. When I came back in the kid was extremely rude. He pointed at me as I was standing and said ""you here for a box"". When I said yes he just rolled his head and walked away and told the cook to make another. When he walked back up, and I asked him what happened with the other box he snap ""what"", however this time at least no fingers. I asked if the other food was thrown away he said, ""Yeah, cuz it was sitting here like 30 mins"" like duh...at this point I'm getting rather upset. I said ""It sucks the food was thrown away, I'm sure someone would have eaten it."" I added, ""I haven't been able to eat my burrito and it's been sitting for 30 mins because I had to come back. Your not making me a new burrito."" He said nothing, turned around and walked away. Just avoiding the situation all together...I'm, excuse me profoundly rude. At least say sorry and walk away if your uncomfortable with complaints. Mind you I do live about 15 mins away I grabbed it on the way home from work. I really wasn't expecting a whole new box...When I called in they should have simply asked ""what would you like us to do for you?"" I would have said hold the box for me I'll be right back. What happens now there's wasted food, my wasted time having to wait again for food to be made and last wasted money for Taco Bell. Lose, Lose, Lose. I don't know about you but I like to Win, Win, Win. Like getting to home at a decent time, sitting down to eat a great burrito I hadn't had in years and going to bed. All that combined justified me wasting even more of my time writing this cruddy review. So back to the kid, by this point I was just plan frustrated with the service and not so nicely but oh so softly spoken continued to voice how I thought it was rude and upsetting but was just continually ignored. The kid went to the make table and the preparer glared at me while I was standing at the counter. So I decided to continue standing their awkwardly in silence because I wasn't putting it past them at this point to compromise my food. He came back only to give me my boyfriend's box still with no apology said, other than the call in that is. I said thanks and walked out never to return again. I've traveled to many places in the Navy where people go to sleep every night without food, heck I know there's several homeless in that area, allow the meal to go to them.  I don't appreciate waste nor do I appreciate kids being rude. Your young and your job is cake, you should always be pumped. I really wasn't expecting much...I never leave such extensive reviews nor negative but I was truly unhappy with the way the night went. I just worked from 8am-6:30pm, making sure people are happy with the service my business provides and I'm proud to do my job. I took a chance with a fast quick meal because I was tired and didn't want to wait long and got home only to find I had to go back out another 30 mins until I was home and eating. Got home, sure enough burrito cold, reheated it in the oven and as to the quality, even with his fresh warm box, reminded us why we never go to Taco Bell. This experience will definitely keep me away for years to come. If for some reason I eat there again I will drive out of the way to avoid this location."
Negative	"My daughter is nine and already very serious about her art.  We've been trying to get her to all the happening Art venues in the area....so we got our Culture Pass for SMoCA and ventured forth.  We went on a Thursday, so we didn't even need to Culture Pass (Thurs are free) but I side with the other person that said if they would have paid they'd have felt robbed!

I guess I was expecting something along the lines of more stuff!  The Paolo Soleri Bridges exhibit was pretty cool and so was the Keys exhibit.  Who knew keys could be so neat as art work?

But the rest?  I know, art is subjective......but my take was that my daughter's artwork exceeds most here."
Negative	"I am giving them 1 STAR. Friday is supposedly a ""Seafood Friday"" and for years people would come here for the crab legs. But since March 1, without any announcement, they stopped serving this. They said that all Boyd Gaming food establishments have stopped serving crab legs. There's a lot of unhappy customers, including my group of 10, who were so dissapointed. The place used to be filled up to the brim every Friday but now the place is half-full or half-empty however you may see it. STAY AWAY!"
Negative	"Eh. I've been here twice now - once for brunch and once for dinner.  There are really no brunch items for someone who doesn't eat meat, which was surprising given that Mexican restaurants are frequently very veggie friendly.  My brunch-mates were also unimpressed with their dishes; they thought it was bland. 

The dinner menu was ok, and the jalapeno pineapple margarita was nice, but the chips & salsas appetizer was very bland. The salsas probably came out of cans. I wanted to like this place because it's so close to my house, but I don't think I'll be back again."
Negative	How am I supposed to sleep when I have to listen to Beyonce all night?  If you're going to have a private party that shuts down the whole pool and part of the casino you should at least tell us when we check in so we have the choice of not staying here.  What a joke this hotel is.
Negative	1 star for getting my drink right. And only 1 star for the nasty attitude at the drive thru window today at 10:53 am. I'm very very disappointed with my visit today. First off I waited in line for about 20 min. Ok nbd I can handle that... but when I got to the window I tried handing my card to the lady and she would NOT take it (I mean straight up refused) until I took my drink first. So this must have rubbed her the wrong way because I know it did me so she grabbed my card charged it and handed it back to me and slammed the window shut. She had not said one word to me!!! I found her to be very rude. So I waited another few minutes until she opened the window again and she finally spoke!! She asked me did you want your receipt or something. Hell yes I want my receipt! I wasn't waiting for a hello!!! I said yes I am. Rudest employee I've come across at any Starbucks ever!!! Short hair, dark skin, mid 20-30s miserable looking woman. Beware of her attitude!!!
Negative	I was at a party and we wanted to order pizza, so we made 2 separate orders to pay with 2 different cards. Both pizzas came at the same time from the same driver. Each person was charged a delivery fee. I called them to tell them what happened and they couldn't refund my delivery fee. Ended up paying $14 for their $5.99 pizza.
Negative	"Went to dinner here with my family last night and it was absolutely horrible. 

The server Tony was great, although the quality of the food left much to be desired. 

Our portions were extremely small, most of the shrimp was over fried and dry.  I had garlic shrimp with my meal and they were swimming in water (probably frozen and nuked to defrost). One of my family members ordered the Fettuccine dish and there was a large black hair right in the middle of the dish.  Two of my family members (including myself) did not receive the butter to dip our lobster in and most of our dishes were cold. 

We called the manager over to alert him of how terrible the quality was, he was quick to apologize but left us all with the impression that he really didn't care about the complaints and there really wasn't a follow up with a visit to the kitchen that we saw.

We received all of our appetizers and pasta dish credited from the bill, although that really wasn't the point of the notice to the manager.

Before leaving, I visited the restrooms and quickly walked right out. They were absolutely filthy and disgusting. Toilet paper everywhere, sinks filled with hair, paper towels all over the floor.  It was a nightmare. 

My family is in the restaurant business and quality of food and customer service should be #1 & 2 priorities, this was NOT the case at this location. They clearly disregard the satisfaction of their clients and it is very apparent.

Overall terrible experience at this location.
They should be ashamed of themselves."
Negative	Oh my - had to repeat my order 4x after waiting 5 minutes to wait to order.   Get the order and they short me a burger.  I will find a new place....did I mention they forgot my drink too.
Negative	"Tried out this place as it's close to work. The inside is nice and clean. Ordering was a breeze as the menu is quite simple.

Ordered the dry vermicelli with beef. The noodles were cooked well however the beef was overcooked and too chewy. The portion size was not very large especially given the price of the meal. Normally at other restaurants if you order without vegetables (the bed of veggies on the bottom of the dish), they tend to give you more noodles. However it was not the case here.

Overall, it was too pricey for what you get and the flavor was lacking. Will likely not return."
Negative	This place is a joke they have the worst management!no idea how to initiate conflict resolution between unruley staff and patrons.I saw a contract security guard grab someone by the throat for no reason then push him.Security is outrageous. Stay away from this place by all means!! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE
Negative	Food was pretty bad. Waiter highly recommended the burger. I ordered medium but didn't realize it was a thin patty that would come out like an over well done hockey puck. I was starving so I didn't send it back. It was terrible. The fries tasted like unsalted MacDonalds fries that had gone stale a week ago. We also got this special rock shrimp hash dish- it was completely flavorless. I've never been to a French restaurant where they use no salt or seasoning whatsoever. Even the iced tea tasted like water. The toast that came with the poached egg (which was at least poached well) was totally stale and gross. It's almost as though the place didn't have a chef and just got some line order cooks to make eggs. I can't believe it calls itself a Thomas Keller restaurant.
Negative	"Rude staff, that got the order wrong and then wanted us to drive around rather than fixing it at the window.


2 stars because the food they did give us was good."
Negative	"Got one clean and exam it was fine 
Than called to make another clean but those wolves were looking to put pressure on me to get an expensive treatment that cost almost a 1000$ when i was just looking for a clean 
**** been checked by other doctors in SF they Did NOT recommend any of that ."
Negative	This place is a joke. My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Vegas and decided we wanted to rent a convertible and drive to LA for a few days and our experience started out alright we called the 800 number and they reserved the car for us at a fair price.  we asked where they were in vegas they said they were just off the strip and we could get a cab there. When we got the reservation confirmation it said we had to go to the airport to catch a shuttle to be able to get there. We called back the 800 number because apparently there is no number to the actual location and they said we did have to take the shuttle after they told us we didnt have too. We took a 25 dollar cab to the airport for the shuttle and after 40 mins of waiting it came and the driver said we could have just taken the cab straight there which was very irritating to find out. We get to the rental place and the rep was very unhelpful and said we would have to pay a deposit which was double what we were told and we needed to have a returning flight number which we didnt have because we were on a road trip and just wanted a nice car to go to LA in.  So we were unable to have the car and we were pissed because when we reserved the car we were not told about these major details. We ended up taking another 25 dollar cab ride back to our hotel. We spent 50 dollars for nothing and we wanted to give fox a chance despite all of the bad reviews. Do not do business with these idiots and pay the extra money and go through a more reputable company. Losing the money was bad but what was worse was my wife was really looking forward to driving to LA in a convertible and was very upset that we could not do so. If it were possible id give this place zero stars
Negative	Disappointing that they changed the chili (beans? beans? In BW Chili???) - 90% reason for going is now gone... :(  I'll check  back in a fews months, maybe temporary change...
Negative	"I am so upset. I was promised 5 free oil changes when I bought my car. I have received 1 and when I took it in for the next one I needed, as well as recall work, I was informed (AFTER the fact) that there was no record of the free oil changes. Not only that, they charged us for a tire rotation I did not authorize. The only thing that should have been charged was the new oil filter. 

They also charged to repair a nail in a tire. Had I known they would I would have taken it to Discount Tire. That service is always free.

And what started my bad mood was their insistence I did not have an appointment. I have both the original email when I made the appointment and the reminder, but they said I must have made the appointment the night before. I made the appointment over 2 weeks in advance.

Not only will I never get work done at their service center (I'll drive to ANY OTHER dealership for warranty or recall work), I will not buy a vehicle or recommend anyone buy a vehicle from them.  That process was a 4 day nightmare on it's own.  

It took them that long to locate a car that fit what we wanted and agreed to purchase in their inventory, then we couldn't purchase it because rats had eaten the wires and disabled the engine - SERIOUSLY!!!"
Negative	First time I had Il Primo Pizza tonight. Never again. I went to my sister's house for dinner. She and her husband ordered il Primo Pizza dilivery. They called at 6:12pm on 5/10/2017. And we're told it would be about an hour wait, as to be expected. At 7:40pm my brother in law call il Primo inquiring where their pizza is. After a 13 min conversation with the extremely​ rude manager he informed the manager that I would be coming in to pick it up. The manager inturn replied that they still had to make it as they were unusually busy for a Wednesday night. When I arrive he was rude to me, no apologies for the wait, not even a good excuse to offer. He didn't know he was talking to a La Cordon Bleu Chef of 25 years. When I counted the 9 guest sitting at the bar and the other 12 sitting at various booths. I could help but wonder where and how all their unusual business went in the five minute drive it took me to get their. When the manager finally did present me with the pizza he the gull to expect a thank you from me. Hospitality is my business. This sack of shit should not be working in any hospitality establishment. I feel for the owner as my sister says she knows him and he's a nice enough man. I will never recommend this place to another as long as that manager is working their.
Negative	"After a year of my daughter attending here, I'm not much of a fan.  The front desk staff is awkward and unorganized.  They lack in professionalism as well.  When they have a recital, be advised to read the ""fine print.""  Recital tee shirts are paid for as part of your recital fees BUT you have to actually ""check the box for the tee""online when registering for said recital or you don't get the tee you've already paid for.  That is so shady.  Why make parents jump thru hoops to get items they've already paid for?  I just find that discomforting and sad.  It's not the only box you have to check to get something else you pay for as well.  Having said that, the teacher we have had was wonderful, which is the reason for the two stars.  On the flip side, the owner is cold and not very friendly.  We go to another local studio for a different class.  In the fall, we'll go there for all our dance classes.  Glad we tried this one because otherwise we'd never have known...but there we are."
Negative	Yesterday was my first time attending a Gen restaurant... my friends really talked it up and convinced me that we should go for the $25 all you can eat dinner menu. I was on board and decided to join. Upon arriving the business looked nice and the ambiance was nice. We didn't wait long to be seated in a booth at the front of the restaurant. We sat and ordered drinks with our server, which I asked for water with lemon.. as she's gone we realize the first issue.. the a/c is blasting over our heads.. so we all froze the entire dinner, and the heat from the grill on the table was obsolete in helping warm us up. Upon arrival with our drinks there was no lemon in my water so I asked for lemon again... she took our order and returned yet again with no lemon. Long story short I asked for lemon 3 times before she came back and realized yet again she didn't grab the lemons and asked a passing bus boy to grab them. My friend also asked for rice 3 times before getting irritated and demanding the rice. One of the food runners brought us dumplings and dropped them on the floor and told us she would be right back with more... she never came back with more. Our server also never once offered to change out our grill. It was honestly awful and I'll never return to a Gen after that. At least not this location!!!!
Negative	"I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich today. Although it filled my empty stomach, the lettuce was old and aged, the bun was soggy, and the chicken was dry. I would not recommend this particular location to anyone, although other Wendy's locations I have attended have been superb. Hopefully this doesn't happen again. Much love

Negative	"A poor excuse for a business misdiagnose , scared the crap out of my husband and my self telling us that our baby bulldog' s cherry eye was an emergency and could only be seen by their surgeon $2600.00 and was an emergency surgery, and could cause brain damage.
Meanwhile we can't even get away from their wellness plan, that we signed up for, 3 Bulldogs
They have a CLASS ACTION SUIT out of California
Disgusting people!
We now go to saguaro animal Hospital , 3 amazing Docters all young and all brilliant! Found out rescue groups use them as well!  
Stay away from Banfield, it cost money to have the wellness plan they get you coming and going
They are cooperate"
Negative	"I am going to add to the horrific reviews. The new owners clearly don't care so why should I? I called to order a large pizza and chicken tenders. I got to the chicken tenders part, and asked the guy for an order over the phone. I asked for xtra honey mustard and he said, they are 85 cents a piece. He said, how many do you want? I assumed he meant the sauce was 85 cents xtra, so I told him i wanted 2 total. He said... "" 2 chicken strips ""? I said no, 2 sauces. He snapped back at me and said... the strips are 85 cents a piece. I replied, oh they are usually sold in a basket of 5 or 6, sorry to bother you and I hung up. If you want decent fast pizza, i would recommend whole foods right across the way. Its 12 bux for a large and made fresh to order. Its really good there. All the mom and pop pizza places are going down the tubes. This place used to be one of the best in town"
Negative	"This is just about the bakery.

I ordered a cake for my son's birthday. I asked for cream cheese frosting. The woman taking my order wasn't sure if cream cheese frosting would work with the design my son picked out. She asked if I had a second choice of frosting just in case. I told her butter cream. She notated cream cheese as my first choice if possible and butter cream as my second. I then came in a few days later and ran into the woman who makes the cakes. I just wanted to adjust the time I wanted it ready but she asked about the notes on the frosting. I explained them to her and she told me merrily that cream cheese wouldn't be a problem. I told her I was glad and she circled the cream cheese frosting. When I picked up I saw the label had cream cheese frosting written on it along with the other details of the cake. However, once the cake was served we could all tell it was whip cream frosting. Not cream cheese. Not even my second choice butter cream. Whip cream. 

Now I've noticed their carrot cake comes with whip cream frosting which we all know should be cream cheese, so maybe someone doesn't know what cream cheese frosting consists of....

I'm just going to start ordering my cakes elsewhere."
Negative	"I wasn't wrong should I say dirty dining
Well what crap we got, thank you for ruining my moms 65th birthday and she is sick almost died last year from chemotherapy and survived so to have her this year was a miracle and when we tried to have them correct it they went back laughing about it like we were some joke I will no longer be coming there or any of my out of or in town family and friends and shame on you people for hanging up on my sick mom and treating her as if we are low class so long to this we will be taking my birthday my three siblings my cousins my aunts my uncles my friend from Alaska Washington Indiana Colorado Michigan Wisconsin you get my point we are a large family no longer going there

I wasn't wrong should I say dirty dining"
Negative	Do not go here unless you want to waste a bunch of your time and money dealing with incompetent jerks. . I had scheduled  an extraction months prior and they literally waited until I was in the office, in the chair getting prepped to tell me that they had not yet looked at my X-rays. The festival of ignorance continued as the fools blubbered around telling me they could refer me to another oral surgeon (not covered by my iinsurance, of course). So I spent hours trying to get these idiots to help me when all of this time they could have told me TWO MONTHS PRIOR that they could not perform my surgery. I missed school, work and my husband missed work to pick me up from a surgery that never occurred. This is the second time this office has screwed us and we will never NEVER give them our business again. Thank you Hudec dental and your incompetent staff for completely ruining my week and causing me to waste hundreds of dollars
Negative	"Found a clothes pin in our soup...legit clothes hanging pin.  

I witnessed customers telling the server their food didn't taste so great and his response was ""if you don't like it eat somewhere else"". Questionable.."
Negative	If I could rate this place lower I would.  This is a slummy area part of town.  The rooms are run down.  The carpets are filthy.  There was a curtain rod for the closet but no curtain.  The staff lie to you.  They tell you that you can't extend your stay after a week because the hotel is fully booked.  Yet you can go online and book a room just at a much higher rate.  So in turn they wanted me out so they could charge more for a crappy room.  I will never stay at this hotel again and I may even re-think using this chain again.  My stay at this hotel was horrible.  If I had not been relocating for a job I would not have stayed here.
Negative	"I'm not sure if this is even worth writing bc it's basically the same as everyone else's reviews and obviously management doesn't bother to read them.
I've been in a couple times and like others have mentioned the staff is extremely rude. 
The store is usually pretty clean and seems decently organized. Just don't expect anyone to be friendly or helpful that is if they even acknowledge your presence.
If your going there to sale stuff don't expect to get much for your clothes, seems less than other places."
Negative	"No stars!! Read the reviews before going but didn't expect a package drop-off experience can be so awful too. Went in, the woman named Susan just told me to leave it on the scale and I asked her I would like to see it scanned into the system before leaving. No response. I waited and then asked her again and again, when will you have a minute to scan in my package first and she said she's busy told me to wait few minutes.

Then I asked her to write me a drop-off receipt and she said write it yourself (what's the point of that if I write my own receipt?). I asked shouldn't it be your job to write the receipt? Then she replied she's not UPS and just treat them as a drop-off box. Checked outside, the sign clearly says ""UPS Store"", so I don't know what she's talking about. Anyways really poor service, I don't think she'll succeed in any business with that kind of attitude! Canada Post service is much better, I'll avoid shipping with UPS after this experience."
Negative	I called to make an appointment and the receptionist was very abrupt and rude.  I am not used to such indifference and rudeness.  I called another office and was treated politely. Avoid this place unless you like being treated poorly.
Negative	Not the best cleaning session I have had... looks as bad as if I cleaned my house myself... which is not good, hence why I called a maid service in the first place.
Negative	"We wanted to purchase an appt here-we check the club house and found the manager  there some big guy Tim I( think that was his name) .
wooowoo this guy is so rude and he thinks that people are working for him, we just ask few questions about the club house and staff like that - this dude probably came from jail or something every answer we got was so rude that we just went out and I told my realtor to cancel the deal-don't want to deal later on with HOA problems when this guy is the manager - it pretty much show the level of the Hoa here !"
Negative	"Second time to eat at this location and was not as happy as last visit. Prices are expensive for the amount of food you get and I think it's wrong for the machine to ask for a tip as you pay on the register before even getting food or service. It's self serve so basically why am I tipping, it's also tacky to leave a tip jar at the register when they only bring your food to your table as drinks and everything else is self serve. I don't see other restaurants asking for tips for the kitchen staff.
Ordered the apple baked rings, while they tasted good I think it's ridiculous to pay $7 and only get 3 on a plate, very deceiving on the menu board.
Will not return as I will continue to visit EAT downtown and other local restaurants there"
Negative	I have traveled many times without any problems.  My familiesfamily's connecting flight in Charlotte was a disaster. We are fine from Orlando to Charlotte to Roanoke. We landed in Charlotte with two minutes to spare for connecting flight to Roanoke needless to say we didn't make that flight.  We were assured we would by the aa rep in Orlando.  The next flight to Roanoke was overbooked.  We were given a food voucher and a stay at the Ramada close by.  That hotel was in the parking lot with a strip club.  My two littles were very intrigued by the building .  The next day the flight got cancelled while we were on the runway.  We were towed back to gate.  We asked to be given a voucher for the rental car and would drive.  We were told no.  We were flown to gboro.  No flight to Roanoke.  We were driven by taxi by a from gboro to Roanoke.  I will think twice before flying American Airlines ever again.
Negative	Nope. I bought the $50 promo, turns out that's not a good deal. Very friendly customer service, but unreliable delivery. I expect a call if a delivery is going to be missed, at the very least, Anyway. Off I go to the water store ...
Negative	"This meal was mediocre at best and it cost $104 pre-tip FOR LUNCH. The margarita, which wasn't even that good (based on ingredients, it should be far cheaper) was $14.  Honestly, if it was homemade or a little effort had been put in, I would've rolled my eyes at the price but I certainly would've understood. I go to any Mexican joint and have that exact margarita for $4.00. It really is absurd.  Considering their patrons are mostly retired people, this is basically elder abuse.  Overcharging old people because they don't know better.

The food was ok.  My husband got the huevos rancheros which was probably the best meal out of the bunch.  I got the General Stack - the potatoes were underdone, though crispy.  I was STARVING and managed to eat more than expected I felt sad every time I took a bite.  Oh, and it only came with two eggs and they promise three (but now I am just nitpicking).  My dad got the shrimp tacos - we took one home for my grandmother to eat.  She loved it, which is a terrible sign.  My dad seemed to think it was ""fine"" but it costs $14 for two tacos.  WHY GOD WHY!?

The highlight was our waitress.  She was delightful.  Very attentive and funny.  We liked her very much.  So a big thank you to that woman for excellence at her job.

The ambiance of the place is nice.  We sat by a fire and enjoyed that.  Honestly, there are some pretty decent restaurants around the area and you should frequent those way, way before this place.  I know they have a great patio (it is raining, we didn't get to sit there) and that is a definite plus but it cannot be worth the sub-par food/drinks.

Check our Cafe Bink before this place.  You'll get better food/drinks and pay way less."
Negative	After leaving 2 messages this last week to get an estimate done and not receiving a phone call back I would say it's a poor way to start out and I'm moving on to other companies.
Negative	"It is my first time here and I heard they are offering lunch time special BOGO. The environment is good, well designed. 
Service: horrible
It wasn't full of customer but the servers were mess up with orders and appetizers. Ruined my mood.

Food: it just ok food and I agreed with some of the comments that, this place is is overpriced and I can get better food from Jtown with a lower price. 

They have good concept but there are problem in the kitchen and management stuff"
Negative	Dear management im hear to inform you that your company needs to follow through. I love your food i order and have recomended my clients to go there for date nights to lunch. I watch want i eat like most people so kids meals are more my portion size . I recently order in the past week i was told that i couldnt recieve it at discounted price which was fine im not cheap i will pay but i dont want to waste food by buying full size. I was told that i will not be served by there manager do to the fact that i gave him more service by sending in more customers . well mr. Manager your rude unprofessional i as well as my team will not be returning. Also i work with well paying clients who are always looking for a new place to eat I will not recommend you guys anymore though your food may be great I will not put up with such despiteful rude people
Negative	"I have lived in Loft 5 for three years. Unfortunately I have had the absolute WORST experience. I have dealt with drug dealers coming in and out of the complex all hours of the night. Selling illegal narcotics from the corners of  the complex. Also, December of 2018 I was awakened by my next door neighbor SHOOTING at residents from his balcony. CNN, cops, ambulance, and all major reporters were at the incident with some civilians harmed. I have also had neighbors banging on my door during the middle of the night whether it be a drunk rampage or running away from their abusive boyfriend. Many domestic violence incidents, illegal drugs dealers, pimps, strippers and prostitution all happening within the complex. Stay far away from this place. They will get you locked into a lease and you will have to deal with many similar issues and it is very unsafe. They do not care about your safety all they care about is your money. The management is very unorganized and racist. I am a Latin young woman and when I spoke with manager ""brieanne"" she told me to take my Spanish drama elsewhere. Most unprofessional, awful place. Keep your family, children, loved ones FAR away from this awful place. It is absolutely disgusting, from the residents living within the complex, to the management running the place. A bunch of scumbags with their GED not knowing how to handle things properly! You will be screwed out of money and most importantly be in danger. The cops constantly sit outside the complex waiting for an incident to occur because of how dangerous this complex is. I am writing this in hopes to help anyone thinking of residing he"
Negative	"The food here is terrible, sugar on potatoes, no seasoning whatsoever on the pulled pork resembling ""brisket"" and the most unprofessional waitstaff I have yet to encounter. Perhaps if one were blinded by the hipster veil of incompetence and self righteousness you'd be able to find a place like this enjoyable, but the flavors found at this establishment leave so much more to be desired. I suppose the wonderful selection of hot sauces is fitting, because if one were to eat any of the dishes found on the menu without drowning it in hot sauce you would be confronted with an inedible meal. The only redeeming part of my experience was the fact that someone in the kitchen was able to cook eggs properly. I will never be back to Monki as doing so is simply unjustifiable from an objective standpoint. If you value food you will take your business elsewhere."
Negative	So far I've waited over 30 minutes at caliber for them to pick me up then caliber manger dropped me off to a room full of customers at Enterprise and only 2 employees working. Great waste of time because they won't staff there locations.
Negative	"Wish I had read the reviews first on Yelp!

The location of the this place is great... but unfortunately that's the only thing I can say that is truly GREAT.

Pros:   Location.  Very good beer prices for what's on tap.  $1.50 draft special.   Pretty good deal.   The appetizers were good, but I'd be surprised if a sports bar/pub could mess up nachos and cheese fries.  They were decent.

Cons:   The food itself is lackluster at best.   With a name like ""Wild Wing Café"" you'd think they were wing experts.  This place does NOT do wings well.   They don't compare to Buffalo Wild Wings.   Wings were under-sauced and cooked to a questionable degree of done-ness.  

I was looking forward to the homemade blue cheese, which seemed to have a mix of poppy seed and vinegar in there.   It was truly disappointing, as I found no chunks of blue cheese and it tasted like it was 90% mayo.   Not impressed.

Of the 4 of us at dinner, no one left impressed.   We left a lot of food on the table, which is surprising for the group I had with me.   We usually eat and drink a lot.  

Sweet Tea was so sweet, I could have sworn it was just guzzling sugar.  I can't say I'm well versed in the sweet tea, but I do drink soda on occasion.  I find Regular coke or pepsi to be fine, but this sweet tea tasted like it had been mixed with 10 giant scoops of sugar per glass.  I took two sips and ordered a beer instead.

Service was ok.  It wasn't terrible, but we found our server missing when we needed attention.   Everyone was pretty friendly.


Overall:   There are tons of great food places in Charlotte.  Go to Buffalo Wild Wings to get your wing fix.   I'd avoid Wild Wing Café unless you're desperate."
Negative	"When you walk in, it's immediately dark.  It doesn't feel like a burger joint, it feels like a burger restaurant.  Nice booths and friendly but slow service.

I got pretty excited while looking at the menu.  There were so many options.  I opted for the Melting Pot burger with the patty done medium.  When the burger came out, it looked good - nicely stacked.  But the first bite into it it was cold, room temperature at best.  The patty was mostly rare and not how a medium burger should be cooked.  The flavors of the cheeses and bacon was good, but the meat patty itself was seriously lacking - I could hardly taste it at all.  

Pretty sorry burger, if you ask me.   I'm hoping my burger was just sitting out cold while they were making the fries, which I ordered chili cheese style.  They tasted good and were hot and piping.  Yum!

Burger was wack.  My friend and I said we could have gotten better burgers at Five Guys (go there instead!).  

There's no excuse for a cold burger."
Negative	"I had paid $30 for the delivery order including $5 tip and I regret every single cent of it !!!! 
The fried wonton is literally fried wonton skin! There's no cheese filling whatsoever!! 
The lunch combo fried rice taste off like it was cooked like 2 days ago or something. The meat taste like fried mystery meat with sauce. The breading of the orange chicken is not crispy at all nor the sesame tofu , it has a chewy soggy breading. The sesame sauce has no flavor it just taste like syrup! 
Ugh I want my money back !!! 
We couldn't eat anything that we ordered so we end up throwing everything away. What a waste of money ! Sorry I would not return to this place ."
Negative	Two or four items were missing from my drive thru order!  I called for over a half hour and the phone was busy... Probably off the hook!  And it is 11pm and I'm not going back!  It's so disappointing when you think you have your entire order, and when you finally get home and sit down in your pajamas to eat your dinner... and half of the order is missing!  Bummer....
Negative	One stars..  Eat is great! But The front staff is terrible & RUDE! They had an issue for seating 5 with a reservation.. maybe if they owner would have a meeting with his staff because they seem so unorganized there wouldn't be a problem... the only time I have problems is with ALL YOUR HOST!!
Negative	"I have to agree with pretty much every thing Jeff S. said.  This store is small, I would much rather go to a ""stand alone"" Best Buy, or one that's in a larger strip mall.  However, if you're needing something quick - say, a gift card, cord, cable, CD or DVD - then by all means stop by here.

The employees are scarce & while they do acknowledge you, they seem to have trouble locating items you would ask for or have questions about. The lighting is very dim, too.

Parking is very difficult, since the building is shared with other businesses - mainly Trader Joe's (where it's always busy)."
Negative	"Let me put it this way: if Trattoria Italia's Lobster Ravoli wasn't soooo incredibly good, this place would be a one star joint. 

To begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right. 

Positives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great. 

Negatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella. 

As for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.

Putting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.

Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely not.

Would I come back here myself? Only for the lobster ravioli."
Negative	"I was super excited to try Petite Maison after the rave reviews here on yelp, and also because my Husband and I will be going to Paris later this year and felt some French food would get us into the spirit.  Unfortunately for us, this was pretty much the worst dining experience we've had in a long time and left us super upset (hopefully going to actual Paris will be MUCH better).

Let me start off by saying that I understand a busy restaurant can be overwhelming to some, and it did seem like Petite Maison was understaffed on Saturday, however I don't think it excuses everything.  First off, the hostess seemed flustered and upset right when we walked up to the hostess stand.  She said the computer wasn't working and to give her a minute.  Once we were sat, she asked us what kind of water we wanted and left to get it (or so we thought).  Our reservation was for 7:15 and we arrived a few minutes early, so we were sat around 7:15 - it wasn't until 7:20 that our waiter finally greeted us (for the first time).  Also, we didn't get water until 7:25 and that was after ordering our meal, getting other drinks, and asking twice for water.  The food did come fast, maybe too fast, considering we got both our appetizer (foie gras) and entree (steak frittes) at the same time.  The foie gras was very tiny compared with pictures I saw posted on yelp.  It tasted good, but I wasn't in love with the accompanying items.  The steak was RARE when we got it.  We knew we would be sending it back - the problem was the waiter never even asked us how we wanted it cooked.  We ate some of the fries while waiting for our waiter to stop by and ask us how things were, so we could send it back, but it took 10 minutes for him to check with us and take it back.  It took another 10 for the steak to come back, and this time it was pretty much med-well (not med like we asked).  In addition, the fries and steak were SOOOOO salty.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  We left with so much salt in our systems it was unbelievable.

So, between the lack of service and just plain bad food, I don't think I will be returning to Petite Maison.  In fact, the only way I would go back is if they gave me back my $60 for this meal.  The waiter was unbelievably unfriendly.  He had zero personality and didn't care that we were having a bad experience.  I really try to look past a lot of things, but this meal was just plain bad from start to finish."
Negative	"Very disappointed with this hotel on many levels.  It was not my choice but host hotel for a symposium.  It is about 30 minutes from  Las Vegas airport  &  the strip.   The registration process was painfully slow & unfriendly.  The resort is located in a quiet suburb that is predominantly senior flavored.  The casino was clean but incredibly smokey &  clientele mostly local folk... lots of Walkers & oxygen tanks &  families going to the cinema & food court.   The reservation was for a king room but we were told it was sold out & not guaranteed.  The rooms are clean & well appointed but hallways were about a mile long with 1 elevator bank at the far end.  The free WIFI never connected! The gym was very nice with free water!  Hours to limited  & pool often closed! The Yard House & Lucille's BBQ were the main bright spots with staff & food that was exceptional. 
We requested an hour late check out & were told it would be billed at $25 plus tax... UGH.  The shuttle to the strip was stressful since there is no guarantee of return ride... $65 for cab ! Drop off point was in the middle of nowhere.  We walked 3 miles down the strip!  
This was not the exhorting Vegas getaway we would have liked.  The senior flavor is fine for locals but staff has a long way to go to improve client service.  Poor eye contact by most wait staff & minimal staffing at registration desk,  casino floor & lounges.   We wanted a fun Vegas weekend & got a wannabe cut rate experience.  Why would anyone pick this place over strip?"
Negative	"It was an average buffet.  Actually, maybe average is a little too generous. 

Now - with that said.....I am not a fan of buffets but did feel slightly excited as this one claimed to be voted the best (maybe for their square mile of Vegas).  Service was pretty slow with lots of mistakes on the drinks.  Even the Pepsi drinks were flat. 

Overall - not worth the trip or the money.  Go somewhere else.  A fast food restaurant would provide you with a better meal and experience."
Negative	Great customer service, I ordered a Oreo flavor cone today. Everything seems alright until I finished half way and found a tissue inside my ice cream, I think I have swallowed a few pieces..I thought it was oatmeal at first........
Negative	I nearly got lock jaw from trying to chew the calamari. The mac and cheese was pretty tasteless. Most of the food left much to be desired, however the chicken wings were great. Not sure they were worth the cost of the buffet though. Better to stick with Hash House if you want to indulge.
Negative	"They started off by messing up my reservation. Then miswrote my room number. After that, I get to the room and you can smell the filthy stench from Dump's Tower down the street. The bedding was clean, but the pillows weren't. Called for new pillows and received weird half-sized pillows. The glasses in the bathroom weren't clean and there were pee runs on the toilets. Continuing on, you can see various handprints and stains on the walls. Oh, and the drains don't work well either. Obviously, I'm not going to stay here again. The mirage was nicer when I stayed there a few years ago. Oh, and even though it has been a few years, everyone should know they don't have their pirate show anymore. I wanted to see a cirque show, but there was no decent bundle. Also they are pretty blatant about the lies they use to justify a incredibly large resort fee. Internet at a paltry 10 Mbps is worth 25$ a day? Even an unlimited cellphone plan is not that expensive. A limited gym to use is worth 17$ a day? Even the most expensive gym in the city doesn't cost hear that. Buy one-get-one-free cocktails? That's just a way to get you to ""save by spending"" Discount on a hypothetical future visit. Might as well give you 25$ toward your next visit to mars."
Negative	"On our first trip to Tempe Marketplace we decided to dine at King's Fish House as me and my wife rarely get to eat fish with an 8 year old in tow, but their kids menu seemed adequate, so we decided to say. 
We started with the Clam Chowder which was flavorful, but the portion was small, which turned out to be a theme throughout the night. 
My wife and I split the Blackened Mahi Mahi with Mango salsa along with Jasmine rice and Glazed carrots. I won't argue with the price of a good meal, but our portions were really small for the price. The rice had only a hit of Jasmine, and the carrots were underdone. The fish was very good, but again I was put off by the portion size. 
For dessert we had Strawberry Shortcake, and while the ""cake"" was good, size was again a problem as the shortcake wasn't much larger than a half-dollar. 
Our waiter was inattentive as we had to ask for drinks and bread several times, and he didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu. 
Overall the food was good, but there was nothing special about the experience at all, and there is not much value based on the portion size. I would not recommend this restaurant."
Negative	"If I could give them a zero, I would. Don't waste your time or money here! I bought winter tires here a year and a half ago. I was told at that time that the price was $67 each spring and fall to have them changed over. The first spring they changed the tires for $60, but they broke a lug bolt one of the tires kept leaking. I had to take it back on two separate occasions for a leaking valve stem. Same valve replaced each time. Obvious incompetence. Come fall the price went up to $90 because I was told I needed to change the TPMS kit with each change over. Oddly I was never told this before. Second change over and the price has gone up $30
Now here we are again in spring, and when I call to schedule to bring it in, I'm told it will cost close to $105. I call my Subaru dealership who says they only charge $80. I call back NTB to cancel and tell them I'm taking it to my dealership. They tell me to bring it in, talk to Leo and they will do it for under $60. That's all I was told. So I said ok. So, I get up early Sunday morning, pack my tires in the car and drive over to NTB. When I get there I'm told that the price is going to be around $105. Same price they told me initially. That the $60 price is without the TPMS kit change, and they won't guarantee the work and the tires might leak. It's over $100 to do it with the kit change which is necessary (mind you, it was only $90 for the same thing 6 months earlier). Why didn't they tell me this the day before? So in order to get my business, they tell me they can do it for less than my dealership, but apparently only if the work is done half-assed. Wasted my Sunday morning for nothing. Going to my dealership.
Never again will they get my business, and I would highly advise you to go somewhere else as well!"
Negative	looks good but tastes bland.  needs to change oil. undercooked or just result of freezing  store bought falafels from a bag,  why cant you just mix up your own? what a waste, steer cleer of this truck.  kind of ridiculous to be  doing what u can do at home for free,  shawarma looks raw
Negative	Their food is alright, nothing spectacular but difficult for them to get my order correct. After ordering the third time and going over the order and them remaking it they still got it incorrect so I wouldn't return to this place.
Negative	"The hotel is smack in the middle of the Strip which is a huge plus.  But for being the brand-new kid on the block I was expecting to be blown away.  Instead my reaction was just meh.  

Went with two girlfriends for my birthday weekend bonanza.  We had a double queen room which was on the 3rd floor overlooking the roof of the casino...hmm.  The room was very clean and the curtains opening automatically is cool.  But several lights weren't working and we couldn't figure out how to plug in our iPods for some getting ready to party music.  Also, the channels on the tv take forever to change (we met some guys in a bar and they confirmed this).  I did appreciate there being 4 robes for our use, but could really do without the fan in the toilet that doesn't turn off.  

As for the casino/resort itself, we liked the Deuce Bar and City Bar, especially with our 2 for 1 coupons.  But beware the martini bump, my Manhatten was an extra $4 even with  the coupon because it is served in a martini glass....seriously.  Didn't go to Haze because the crowd looked very ghetto but did try to spend the day at Liquid Pool Lounge.  Unfortunately they don't allow you to drink in the pool, unlike Wet Republic at MGM, so I had to have my birthday beer at the bar.  After an hour of sobriety we bailed.  If you don't have a cabana or lounge chair Liquid is a disappointment.  

Aria, it looks pretty, but like a girl with too much makeup when you look a little deeper you see a lot of blemishes."
Negative	CROWDED, too many people for the space. Ran out of all the meat-based dishes the night we went, and it was early evening when this happened. LOOOOONG lines for what food was available, slow service. Small portions. Ugh. Go to the one in Chandler instead.
Negative	Worst billing department. The billing dept never return calls and . will not try to work with insurance, That dept put all the research, resolution, etc on the patient. Its really sad because I really liked Dr Koi and his staff but I will be looking for a different urologist. And best believe, when my friends ask for references, referrals, I will steer them away from this company.
Negative	Great sushi, terrible experience. I won't ever order here again. We did an order via Grubhub and paid in full. My husband was unaware of this so he paid for the order when he picked up the sushi. I called to explain and was told he'd have to come in for a refund, but was already back home. The lady one the phone said she could just refund the grubhub account and she said yes and not to worry. Well, 4 days and another phone call during the week later where i was assured yet again that I'd have a refund...still no refund. Not even a pending refund. So I call and the waitress on the other line tells me that the person who handled my order isn't in so I'll have to wait til she's in. Okay....it's pretty simple. I was double charged and I want a refund on one of my accounts. She's starts getting sassy with me, tells me to come in after 5, then hangs up the phone. Never eating here again.
Negative	I wanted to like this place. Had a deal almost made on a nice truck. Be prepared for lowball-city on your trade if you have one. They won't budge on anything and that's unfortunate, but this place really earns 1-star for the terrible customer service. The sales manager will laugh in your face and dress you down if you politely suggest a more favorable trade-in number. From what I gather this place probably specializes in flipping cars at auction, and couldn't care less about retail sale customers.
Negative	Tried their signature chicken wings; not only was it more expensive than the other local wings places, I was genuinely surprised by the bad quality, considering that wings was supposed to be their specialty. The wings here are literally fried chicken carcasses, imagine KFC chicken but with all the chicken meat shaved off before deep frying - there is barely any meat, only bones! Also, the wings was not served with fries or anything filling but instead replaced by small portions of diced radish and coleslaw. Needless to say, if you are looking for a wings night, avoid this place at all cost.
Negative	"Meh. I think this place is hyped up. My friend and I came here after work after seeing all the pictures and reviews. We are big seafood lovers so we were very excited. But mehhh it was a let down for us. 
The place is small and only has 3 tables or so, but it had a nice and cute vibe. 
For the soft shell crab burgers - it was bland and there was too much bun and batter. The actual size of the crab was tiny, it just looked big because of the thick bland batter. 
We got the lobster roll as well, and it wasn't too bad compared to the crab burger, but again, not mind blowing. 
Thoroughly a disappointing experience for my friend and me."
Negative	"I didn't hear good things about them from passengers.  They happened to be the only airline flying out to the bay area when I needed to, on short notice.  I disliked how the options returned mostly one way flights.  I greatly disliked how much pricier they were than Allegiant, who no longer had Saturday flights at the time.  But Spirit was just under the cost for SouthWest.  Either way I was cringing at the cost for a damn domestic flight.  

The charge for bags is ridiculous.  I layered my leggings and sweaters and stuff,  just so I wouldn't have to pay for a carry on; one night stay.  Good thing the weather permitted or I'd be a toaster.

Then on the flight out of LV, we hit some turbulence.  Flight attendant was holding on while standing, but SMILING ???! ... while passengers were gasping.  I had my seat belt but I still slid down cuz the plane friggin' dropped.  Literally felt like a couple seconds of free fall.  Eh meh gawsh dude I wanted to be mad at him for smiling but I was too scared for our lives.  Pilot steadied the plane.  I wish it happened sooner.  Don't know how in-control a pilot can be in such nature encounters.

A star for the smiling flight attendant.  He actually kept my mind distracted from too much fear.  Another star for the 5000 free miles contest the airline had on my flights going back home - which were much smoother thank goodness."
Negative	"Store manager Clinton does not represent Michael Bollig's vision of friendly or professional as stated on the website. Clinton was extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory. While arranging the delivery of my dryer we encountered a miscommunication and the coordination of delivering my dryer became complicated. Instead of Clinton taking responsibility for the miscommunication he made every excuse in the book and tried to pass the blame onto me. As I tried to explain the situation he talked over me, raised his voice and was very condescending. I expressed my dissatisfaction with his lack of customer service; however he did not seem to care. On the other hand, the delivery driver was very nice and accommodating. He waited over an hour for me to get home to make up for the miscommunication. I appreciated that greatly and displayed my gratitude with a tip. I was disappointed to notice a ding on my wall from the installation of my dryer after he left. I guarantee Clinton has cost B&B Appliances a lot of money by his lack of customer regard and therefore loss of future business. He could definitely benefit from some coaching regarding customer service and professionalism. I never post on yelp, but here I am 9 hours later still astonished by the worst customer service I have EVER encountered.

Negative	Too bad Rosatti's has jacked up their prices... I just cancelled the order to go with NYPD as even before coupon they are a much better value and NYPD is a superior pizza!
Negative	This is ridiculous because every time I go here it's closed. We even made a point to call and ask if it is going to be open and they said yes and sure enough it's closed. I mean really?? Tell us if you're going to be closed! I'm sure their food is amazing but it's so frustrating that I don't even know if I want to try anymore.
Negative	"I really love Burger King and never had a issue til the last couple days ago. One I had ordered meal under $15 and I had got asked to see ID, seriously ID?? I would expect to see ID if I order maybe over $50 but really. When I asked why they need it all I got was because I need it. 
Next I had ordered food from the place and gAve them a $10 bill and the guy literally took 5 min looking at it. I promise it was not fake. Very rude customer service."
Negative	"Poor customer service! If I come in at 11:05 o should still b able to get food. I'm the customer...i went back on sunday and  i was served well so 4 stars because i ate but they need to let ppl know they dont serve food after 10:59pm when they close at 12...

THE REST OF THIS MONTH THE ENTIRE MEUN IS $5 THATS RIGHT ALL MEANS ARE $5!!"
Negative	Very average breakfast place to me that's hyped up for no reason. I've also had their dinner and wasn't too pleased with that either. This place is not cheap, but the portions are huge...almost too huge. The service was fine...I was just disappointed in this place because I was expecting a little more. All in all...its just a run of the mill kind of place!
Negative	We went here on a Friday night at prime time, around 7:30 pm only to see four other tables in the restaurant. These were the only four tables that remained in the restaurant for the next couple of hours it took for us to finish our dining experience. Perhaps it would have been better if every single dish ordered by each person came out at the same time. Literally every item, cold or hot, sushi or hibachi came out separate from each other, leaving the other three to watch. Not just separate but with at least ten minutes surrounding the periods of waiting for the other dishes to come out. My sushi was mediocre at best. My boyfriend got a sashimi bowl with a giant piece of raw garlic (???) that took over and ruined the entire dish. I would love to see this restaurant do well, but that task is up to the kitchen staff and management to run a proper restaurant where patrons can eat together at the same time.
Negative	If I could give negative stars, I would. Worst car wash EVER! I didn't know a car could get dirtier after a wash. After a full interior and exterior there is still crap all over the carpets, rocks (which definitely wasn't here before) and the front of the car is still filthy.... The tires are half sprayed and most of the shine crap is all over my rims. This place is ridiculous. Get it together terribles.
Negative	This place is horrible! Don't put out your loved ones here. The staff at this place don't care!!! My grandma was admitted to this place because she needed to regain strength after being in the hospital for 2 weeks. My parents checked this place out and it's not what they make it out to be! My grandma has been here for about a little over a week. They have been told that she is not allowed to get up without assistance. No one was watching her she got up a few times. The times i was there it had to been over an hour each time. Not once did anyone go into the room to check up on her. My mom would go in the morning and a few times found my grandma in the bathroom by herself. Today my grandma was transported back to the hospital at 5am and no one from the facility called to let anyone know in my family know.The hospital called to inform us that she was there. My parents went back to the facility to pack her belongings and they already boxed everything up.
Negative	Never again. Good yogurt, horrible service. My husband and I were at the counter ordering when the male employee (friday night dec 19) tried to take the people behind us. He told me (as I was still ordering and picking out toppings) to move for his customer (no room) and that my husband had to wait to put in his order. When I told him we were first and asked if theycouldat least wait until I finished,  he told his customer to walk around us making it difficult to finish ordering, paying, anything. He was so rude we walked away.   I come to this airport once a month and will never give this establishment my money.
Negative	I had dinner there too night with two local friends. I ordered the grilled chicken plate that came with Mac n cheese and slaw. The chicken breast had bbq sauce on it. I don't think I have ever had Mac n cheese as dry as that. It was horrible. The chicken was rubbery. The slaw ok,. My first mistake was not sending it back but my friends had recommended this restaurant and I didn't want embarrass them. My second mistake was coming to eat here.....
Negative	Normally pita jungle is so good but I got takeout tonight and the chicken looks like it's saturated in Taco Bell mild sauce and the veggies are burnt yet undercooked. I'm so irritated.
Negative	This is by far the worst starbucks I've ever been to. It's so bad, that I feel obligated to write a review which is something I hardly take time to do. 15 minutes for a pike place coffee on the drive thru? Great work guys!
Negative	So after a horrible, quick, rude and unhelpful experience that lasted about 35 minutes, I'm billed $419!!  $379 on insurance and $40 for who know's what,..It doesn't state what the $40 is for.  I don't have a co-pay.  They did want to charge me $40 to fill out 2 pages of military paperwork which they never did.(You'd think a decent person or business would fill out 5 minutes max of paperwork for a vet,...maybe give back a little,..  LOL  not these guys,.. they could care less!!)  They did charge $379 to my insurance,.. asked me to be there 30 minutes early and fill out 6 pages of paperwork.  I didn't ask for a discount for filling out all this paperwork,.. but we're not on the same level,.. these people are entitled and demeaning.  These people acted like they were giving out free appointments, I cannot believe how disrespectful they were.    Dr Richardson left the office before filling out any paperwork and was unavailable unless I scheduled another appointment with the rude assistant.  Which I'm sure they'd charge another $300+.  This place is a nightmare,... money hungry turn and burn business!!
Negative	Keats Connelly is the WORST Financial Advising/Tax Services/Investing firm that I have ever come into contact with.  They made big promises...and failed in every aspect.  They have screwed up my international taxes 2 years in a row.  1) They forgot to mail me my taxes- and they sat on a desk never being mailed to me.  This gave me added interest and penalties that I had to pay out of my own pocket due to their error.  2) The forgot to file additional/supplemental forms, which also cost me thousands and thousands of dollars.  When talking to the accountant he started to yell on the phone- it was so unprofessional.  We never got to the money management part- however, they were never shy to charge us massive money for this.....It is such a huge, complete, waste of money.  Not only do they not deliver on their promises, they are extremely expensive- more so than other major international tax/accounting/financial planning firm.  I would not recommend them to anyone- especially if they do not want to be a target by the tax man.  Stay far, far away!
Negative	"This place is a joke.  Gated community? Hardly.  There are gates but they don't work.  Anyone can have access to this place.  If you bring up any security issues to the office, they pretty much shrug it off.  There's been numerous times where I've seen outsiders (people that don't live here) come in to the community area (which is also ""gated"") by simply putting their arm over the gate to release the door.  Then they can roam about and use the pool area/hot tub etc., and pretty much anywhere else they want to.  Security? I've seen them but they don't do anything.  Just a fixture to make people feel like they're safe.  Do the apartments look nice?  They sure do but don't let it fool you.  Everything inside is cheap cheap cheap.  Did I say cheap?  The appliances are worthless.  Looking over some of these reviews are laughable and I can't help but think that it's the company making them."
Negative	"We stopped at this location as the parking lot at Lucky's on the Lake was packed. The parking lot was mostly empty, save for a fairly large group of bikers.
The bartender, server, and cook all seemed pleasant. The beer selection was good.
We were told that our first choice of appetizer (the bacon balls) was no longer available.
The mac & cheese bites were decent. However, the burgers and fries were not very good. Bland dry beef and crushed pepper on the fries were terrible. But the bonus was later, when we both spent most of the remainder of the day in the bathroom.
If the food is similar to that of their Okee location, then I'm glad we didn't waste the time waiting for a parking spot to open up at there."
Negative	"I finally decided to cash in my comps here tonight and go to Fright Dome; the people at the casino desk informed me that despite being able to use my comps at Adventure Dome and having the cash value of tickets in comps, I couldn't get tickets for Fright Dome. They actually weren't sure at first and said they called to confirm with someone that I couldn't, but couldn't explain why. 

I'm pretty sure they were just blowing me off and the icing on the cake was when the guy said ""don't let it ruin your night"" in a way that i felt was condescending. Ruin my night? Buddy, I'm at Circus Circus; let's be realistic about expectations. I don't expect clean bathrooms, I don't expect well kept facilities, in fact, I don't expect anything other than to be treated with the relatively little respect entitled to someone that drops in on often enough occasions to even accumulate comps. Clearly my request for tickets to a haunted house in exchange for the comps I've earned was too bourgeois, so I paid cash for them that I might have gambled with afterwards and went home when I was done.

Fright Dome itself was fun though; I don't blame them and felt like it was worth the price of admission (get the extra line pass; it's worth it!). If I'd have gotten my tickets or at least a reasonable explanation instead of a blowoff, Circus Circus would have earned my loyalty. My two cents; go to Fright Dome and gamble someplace else."
Negative	This hotel is okay. Not worth the amount they charge. I usually like to stay at the Mlife hotels and never had any problems while visiting. So what went wrong here was first of all the check-in took forever and my party was given the wrong information regarding the transaction. We we're suppose to be check-in at 9am, but was delayed by the person checking us in at the hotel because she gave us the wrong information and made us waste time by having us run around trying to find a Wells Fargo. Next the maid open the door during our visit when the light was clearly marked as privacy. The toilet broke and we had to wait for maintenance to come fix it. The light was flickering off and on. Also there was a red stain on one of the sheets. Finally when we checked out the lady checking us out was giving us attitude about printing a receipt. Honestly there are way better hotels then this place. Also for something that is more new to the strip compared to the other hotels it looks old in the rooms and hallways. The only reason I am giving the one star was because the Zarakana show was really good and so was the theatre it was playing in. I was just really frustrated with everything that I even took the time to do there 30min survey and explain everything that went wrong with there staff. I am so mad i even created a yelp account just so I can rate them and share this with people planning or thinking of staying at the aria. I will no longer be staying at the aria.
Negative	"Worst cleaners ever. I travel for work a lot and really depend on cleaners to get my pants ready in a few days before I take off again for three weeks. I took 10 pieces to get dry cleaned before I was set to leave again  I went to pick it up when they told me it would be finished.  It wasn't done. I will never go there again and I will deter whoever I can from going there. I think they just moved their location to down the street. 

Also, this is the most expensive place I have ever been. Another cleaner down the street is HALF the price."
Negative	Been there four times. Each time its gotten a little worse. Seems like smaller portions and the quality is diminished by rushed service in the kitchen. Most recently, hamburger that was so salty it was ridiculous, 20 minute wait for the next try. my wife's Salmon couldn't have weighted 3 OZs and was well done. Again, the perception of problems in the kitchen. We're going to take a break from the Local Dish for a while
Negative	"We stayed at the Excalibur for three nights. Keep in mind it is located adjacent to Mandalay Bay and the Luxor of which both have a much cleaner nicer atmosphere as far as public areas go. 
We had a king room in the royal tower. The room is dated to a point that it just doesn't feel clean (though it was). It still has popcorn ceilings, old tile in the bathroom and a very dated shower stall. No it wasn't a handicapped shower. No tub, which after a day of being on the move was sorely missed. The king size bed only came with three small pillows and when you called for extras you were only allowed two additional.
The room was bare minimum no coffee maker, no fridge, no microwave. It was a quiet room, but I would definitely recommend trying to stay elsewhere.

Keep in mind the pricing is very misleading. Whatever room rate you see you will need to add on a $30.00 per day resort fee and $10.00 parking fee per day if you have a car. The restaurants are mostly fast food and have a very poor selection. With that being said do your home work and really compare apples to apples before you decide to stay at the Excalibur.

We definitely wouldn't recommend it or stay again."
Negative	"We had this company do a kitchen remodel and floor tile about 5 months ago. The communication with the business owner after they took our deposit was very poor. 

During the initial sales meeting before work, we were told our project would be worked on every day until it was done.  This was not the case. 

Also, our deposit check was cashed immediately, but my husband had to make several calls before we were scheduled, even though they took our money.

The floor tiling was very poor quality. Now, just a few months later, the grout is flaking away in big chunks. We have to pay someone else to fix the poor grout job."
Negative	This place doesn't exactly make sense. Is it a sports bar? If so, what kind of sports bar is pet friendly? As you walk in and notice the peanuts in the dog dish, it's actually a precursor to the quality of the food you receive. It's low quality, microwaveable type food. It's about as appealing as dog food. DO NOT order chicken here. It got me very sick. A family member ordered a meal with chicken here, and also became ill. And nothing ruins your dinner like the sounds of an auto shop next door. I'd recommend just skipping this place and going to a real restaurant.
Negative	"Big disclaimer about this review.....

I was finishing up my meal when I saw the waitress bring a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce to the condiment area.  Apparently, they have 4 bottles for the entire restaurant and a couple of customers decided to bring them to their table.  I didn't know that.  Chips/salsa are $2.49 and they charge for pico so I passed on both.  That being said, you're about to read a review for a Mexican food with no pico, no salsa, no red sauce, and no green sauce.  

I ordered the ""Choose 3"" meal and got one asada, one carnitas, and one fish taco.  The meal option adds rice and beans.  All 3 were a bit dry (see above).  They just don't naturally come with a lot of wetness.  They have jalapenos and lime in the condiment area, but they are stored uncovered and they were dry as well.  The tacos were a little too bland for my taste, especially the fish taco.  The rice and beans are average.  The total was $7.12 but I did not get a drink.

I'm a ""sauce whore"" at Mexican restaurants so you can take or leave my opinion on the food.  I'm used to having plenty to spread around and it's a bit of a turn-off to have to pay extra for it.

Overall, the place is nice.  The service is friendly.  The food comes fast.  But it seems they need to choose whether they want to be a ""street taco"" kind of place or a regular Mexican restaurant.  If you order a 3-taco set, plus the chips/salsa, plus the pico, plus a drink, you're going to be close to $15 for your meal served on plastic plates.  For that price I'd probably go to more of a sit-down restaurant with a full menu.

I'll give them another try when they have their ""taco Tuesday"" special where you can get them for $1 each.  And hopefully the sauce bottles will be available...."
Negative	"1. Waiting in line with a number. I am in front of the hostess table. Shes call all the numbers ahead of me. I see a group after me get seated first. Look at their numbering chart. See my uncalled number crossed off. Get seated right away after showing them my number (after waiting 45 mins). 

2. Food took a very long time to get to our table. But before our ordered food arrived, we were given not one but two orders that belonged to other tables. 

3. After our meals (which were ok), we asked for our dessert. The first one came quickly, the double fromage cheese cake. The one from Tsjuiri is amazing, so we thought maybe it would be similar. Nop. To be fair, it may have been good but just in comparison, it can't compete. Anyways, we were a group of 3, they have us two spoons, and promptly left. We tried to grab another server for another spoon and that was a mission in itself (took approx. 10 mins). Then we waited another 20 or so minutes for our next dessert, the raindrop cake. Which we thought would be the quickest, as it should just pop out of the fridge. Anyways, wasn't as ""raindrop-y"" as I hoped. It was like a lychee jello with sakura.

Its amazing that this place is this busy. Maybe I just didn't get the best dishes or it was just an unorganized group of staff, but I won't be back."
Negative	"I grew up in the suburbs so I love me a good mall.

This is not a good mall. It's not even a mediocre mall. In fact the single redeeming quality that the Fairview Mall possesses is a Shoppers Drug Mart which stocks my favorite Goody hairhints Ouchless black elastic hair bands (which are strangely difficult to find in New York.)"
Negative	"I visited this place during my trip to Vegas. 

 The wait....the wait to get seated was serious. It's not close to the strip,but you can tell that the locals love this place. Usually, I stick to omelettes as, I am not much of a breakfast eater. However, the wait staff ""hyped up"" the Country Fried Steak and it was just gross. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but, it tasted like grounded scrapple. You know?! That southern delicacy... And I just wasn't expecting it in Las Vegas, which is definitely not the South! The only thing I enjoyed was the lemonade and the ""Home Fries"" which are basically diced potatoes. I opted for $2 extra to add peppers. And it was decent. I will say that the price range was very good. I just wished that the food was as well. The wait staffed on 11/21 just seemed gloomy for a Monday. Overall, I wouldn't come back. Try Cracker Barrel."
Negative	This location is alright. I live pretty close so I do frequent this store. They seem to have a problem with wanting to help the customers. I used to come in the morning before work and they would always tell me it would be 20-30 minutes before they could help me because they were doing beginning of day procedures. Sometimes, no one even comes to the counter and you have to stand in the lobby for 10 minutes. There are a couple of nice employees but most of them are rude.
Negative	"I travel quite often and found this to be one of the easiest airports to come in and out. Everything is properly labeled, found and offered. There are plenty of restaurants to tantalize even the sweetest of tooth or the healthy of individual. 
As soon as you land you can test Lady Luck with plenty of gaming machines!! 
There is a lot to do just in case you miss your flight or if there is a delay."
Negative	This is by far the worse at&t store to do business in. I spent several hours and days in this place. I was also charged twice and when I called about it I was told I was already refunded and found out thru my bank that they never refunded me the money. There were a few pleasant workers but other than that I wish I would have never stepped foot into this place.
Negative	"This is another example of buying product hype and a service that is not ready for primetime. 

When it works, it's great, when it doesn't, which is often, customer service is clueless. They go by a manual but clearly don't know what the purpose is for certain procedures.

Then, when nothing else works, you get transferred (maybe) to a ""Level 2 tech."" Oh boy! 

What they've usually said, after a lot of useless attempts from the livel 1 tech, is, ""Oh, they're down for maintenance."" This was said once in the middle of the day. I asked if they meant routine maintenance, she said she thought so. 

There's a great time to do it. During business hours, if that was correct.

When it wasn't working for the 3rd day in a row, I was told they would need 7-10 days to investigate. Then, this morning, it was working again. But, it wouldn't connect with Gmail. Everything else worked but that. The level 1 tech suggested I disconnect the modem and/or router, reboot, etc. Now nothing works. I called back and they said the system is out in this area. He said it would be back online within an hour. That was 3 hours ago!

Beware, buy only when all the beta kinks are out."
Negative	"I can't begin to describe how horrible this place is, they sold me a broken part of a sectional. When I called I was told that I was more than welcome to come exchange it. Sure it handy to be able to do that, ya know since I PAID one of my employees to help me move this today in our box truck from work. So now I can figure out how to have this large broken (in a dangerous way if a kid got on it) POS sitting in the middle of my living room. They want me to bring it back, which is great I'll ask my pregnant wife to help me load it on up:/. 

I cut my arm on the broken piece and told the ""manager"" that I didn't want it in my house. She kept saying there was nothing they could do about it, blah blah blah. 

Finally, I told her that I would call my employee to come over and help me move the couch. But I expected the piece would be ready and not broken or I would set it on the curb and dispute the charges with my credit card. At this point she said they wanted me to return it since I disliked their company so much. I told her I wasn't going to go out of my way to return it and it needed to be gone tonight. Amazingly, they all of a sudden have delivery drivers to come pick it up.

Fun, now it takes 3-5 days to get my money back and I'm stuck waiting for them to come pick this up."
Negative	Very disappointing, the server had no Knowledge of the menu, Very small servings for the price of the food, food was very salty and deserts very small and not tasty at all. Over priced and underfeed! We won't be gong back unfortunately because we need a good restaurant in this part of town
Negative	Omg so much grease! It's was dripping off every slice. There was so much sauce and we requested light sauce. I'm scared to think what normal would look like. The garlic knots were bland. A waste of time and money.
Negative	My girlfriend and I decided to brave the freezing cold and stop by for some chicken  to warm us up. We both ordered a meal to go and began our wait at 1:07, id say about ten other people came in after us and ordered and received their meals before us. Come 1:34 we finally received our meal and had to sprint to my car so I would not get a ticket. I had thought to ask if the chicken I was eating was fresh butchered since it took so long. Anywho. I dont think ill be going back to this establishment. After the long wait. Our chicken/fries didnt even taste fresh.
Negative	Paid a decent amount to play golf. Don't get me wrong, course was in great condition but pace of play wasn't worth what I spent. Shot my worst round ever because each hold we were stuck behind the group in front of us for 15-20 minutes. Called the clubhouse and ranger said Not much he could do. This also wasn't a Saturday or Sunday, but a Monday. I'll think twice before booking here again. Not happy about it at all. I paid for 4 people.
Negative	These guys are scam artists.The first co.Western Security Consultants  concists of Ron Slay who was short on phone and not personable at all.Called another co Desert polygraph.Sanjo was nice and spent time on phone making me feel comfortable.I asked for a 1 fidelity question about a certain date.He explained how it was better to cover the whole relationship.Even better.He also explained how not using names was best as to not exclude anyone.I agreed and set appt.He was rude to my hubby who obviously was not happy to be there and could have been made to feel better with kind words.Next he says pay me and explains briefly about admissions.You will only find out what he discloses and only if he signs your name on paper which I did not see.After the test he told me there  were no admissions.This was a lie.There were two minor things as I heard most of the interview and exam around the corner.My hubby told me about them but San did not confirm with me and took husbands word in exam that I knew.Husband could have lied.Then I was told he passed.I found out days later that he had only asked about the marriage ( 6 mos) not the entire relationship ( 3 1/2 years)as agreed and used my name which would not exclude other Jennys. Common name for female.He did not give me what I agreed and he told me he would for $500 cash.He was then very rude to me telling me I have trust issues.Well they didnt come from no where hence the test.When I asked why he changesd from what he first told me he just kept saying he passed so why does it matter.San lied to me and got $500 why would I trust HIM.Completely unethical and not at all good biz .When you pull up to building it says WSC which had bad reviews but is also Desert Polygraph and The Polygraph Place.they are all different names,examiners and phone numbers,same address.Should have been a red flag as these guys all work together and the multiple names are from bad reviews.I will remove this review for a refund of 400.You keep 100 for your time.This test was a sham.and you did not deliver as told.*UPDATE* changed from 1 to 2 stars Because owner ron called me and agreed to refund full amount to take down reveiws.He was sullen but nice.Sob story about hurting his biz but if he was going to refund I would even leave a positive about him being ethical.Drove al the way there and was given 250 after being told I wasnt going to take down reviews.FU! Then he gave me another 100 and some more bs talk.Really! They clearly work together and have the same lack of integrity.Screw you.I would have given you a positive if you came through as promised without the insults.Feels like a double whammy.
Negative	We purchased a kitchen set on the weekend from the Whitby store and the item was to be delivered to the store on the Thursday following. When we got home we realized the set would not be a good fit for our kitchen. We went into the store on Tuesday to advise and was told absolutely no refunds or exchanges. The product hadn't even been delivered to the store yet. We asked to speak with the sales manager Basil who told us absolutely no refunds and pointed out the tiny print buried on the bottom of the receipt. At the time of purchase, our salesman did not point out this fact. There is no sign posted at the customer service desk that states no refunds or exchanges. This is not a bargain basement type store..........why do they have bargain basement standards. BUYER BEWARE. It was our first and last time shopping with Bad Boy.
Negative	"Not so great. Order delivery last night, love the online ordering system- super easy. We ordered hot bbq wings, loved that you could pick all drums or wings. We got all drums and the sauce was decent but the wings were over cooked, dry and weirdly crispy. Not a fan of them and we have pretty much the whole box left.

We also order the pizza bianco which sounded tasty but had way, way, way too much ricotta cheese, it had a whole layer of it an overwhelmed the entire pizza. Because of the ricotta overload the pizza had a very mushy texture and the rest of the cheese that was sitting on the ricotta just slide off. Worst white pizza I had in a long time.

On a whim we order the meatball starters, very generic and not very good. The sauce tastes like it came out of a jar and won't order again.

One plus was it was delivered very quickly and the guy was super nice, but I do not believe we will order from them again. If we do it will definitely be something else then what we got last night."
Negative	"I am a military member and I am utterly disgusted by the service I received here. I will try to make a long story short: 

I left my charger cord in my rental. I thought ""no big deal""- it's a 2 ft long, pink charger that was plugged into the interface of the dashboard, it would be impossible to miss when they cleaned out the car for the next customer.

I tried for hours to contact the direct office, but they were forwarding every call to a district office. Of course they could not give me any information on the location of the item. Then they informed me that the only employee with a key to the lost and found leaves at 5pm daily, and NOBODY has access to the lost and found over the weekend. How cleverly profitable that they conveniently don't have access to their lost and found on the busiest days of sales/returns! By the way, if they can't open the lost and found to get your item before you fly out, you are forced to pay shipping to recieve your item.

After much persistence and multiple transferred calls, I was finally connected with someone on site, just to be told my charger was not there. I went there in person later that day to confirm that my charger was either still there or grew legs and walked off. The manager that ""helped"" me was very dismissive and clearly more focused on processing the man stepping out of a sports car than helping me figure out how my property vanished from their establishment.

I went back one last time before my flight and that was when i was told there is no access to their lost and found after 5. Once again, convenient. Over 10 phone calls later and 2 visits to the establishment, I still have no answers to why my property wasn't turned in to the lost and found after being reported less than 24 hours later. Furthermore, I'm especially perplexed by supervisors' nonchalant lack of concern for not only the violation of policy, but the THEFT that was committed by their employee(s). I will be filing a formal complaint with their corporate office, as well as the contracting office at my home station. I will not support or encourage businesses that do not enforce policy, especially those that protect their customers from theft, nor do I think my branch would intentionally maintain a contract with a company that unapologetically steals from customers. I've been a loyal customer for nearly a decade- that period has now come to an end."
Negative	"The work was mediocre... Customer Service was TERRIBLE. If I had a slight request like ""please do not cut my cuticles just push them down"" I received an eye roll.  I am not a picky person at all but felt like I had to apologize if there was a slight conflict. I have experienced better atmosphere and professionalism elsewhere. Sounds cliche but there is a feeling that they are talking about you in their language.  All the girls speak perfect english so for them to revert back to their language especilly after a conflict feels uncomfortable. Everything from voice inflection to the laughing to the eye rolling gives a high school mean girl feel."
Negative	Wish I give 0 stars. I guess I should've listened to the other reviews but my first visit was great. Not the case for this visit. If I'm paying for service why not give the customer what they want my but what took the cake was when I was waiting on my toes to dry she was spraying the chemical in the bowl. Who wants chemicals splashing on their legs?!  I was so heated. Ask for the manager and they were on vacation. To think I waited to all week to drive 30 mins for this crap.
Negative	have bought a ton of shoes here over the past year. if your in the shoe game you know you have to come back to a place a bunch of times to find your joint. That said, the service here sucks and has steadily decreased since top dog manager Mike (from jersey or something) left. I think my shopping spree's here have all but come to an end. crappy inattentive service makes visiting this place a drag.
Negative	Total scam and waste of $.  Machines are always down and too busy most of the time to even focus on your own workout.  Please reconsider your gym before paying LA fitness $29.99 a month when you can help a local gym who is appreciative of your business.  Thank you for reading
Negative	Too expensive, service is speedy and not professional done. The guy doing my pedicure kept sniffling and whupping his nose with the back of his hand and throughout the pedicure. Spa pedi $30, Mani $24, tools are dirty, and they rush through it. The mani nails were different lengths and nog polished off. The underside of the nails had all kinds of unfilled extra nail residue. The tools, towels and area were dirty at 10:00am .... And we were the first customers! They don't do an itemized bill and if you charge it.., it doesn't have the tip line. They expect the tip in cash! I didn't have any cash on me. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Better yet don't get your nails done in a mall. They charge mall prices and finish you off as quickly as they can, as soon as the next customer comes in!
Negative	"I would not recommend this dermatologist. My appointment was at 1030 I arrived at 1014, by 11am I still wasn't placed in a room! 
If you have time to waste then sign up here. Clearly they are over booking themselves at the patients cost. 
Also they are UNABLE to give you a itemized receipt at your visit. The front desk ladies were condescending and unable to problem solve. 
Pretty unfortunate, I left I'll be looking for another Dr in Gilbert! 
PS- another guy in front of me complained of the same thing. 
Get it together."
Negative	Do not take your dog to groomed her.  They do a horrible job.  They made me buy a brush and brush her for 45 minutes before they would see her even though she just went there 2 weeks ago.  I found a new place that said they never cut the hair in her ears or did her feet correctly. Find a small local place instead!!!
Negative	"2.5 stars is more accurate....just can't give it 3.

Stopped in with my wife and daughter for lunch and sadly left unimpressed. Service.....good. Setting......good. Food and price......not so much. I ordered the Kobe Burger and a side of fries and was really looking forward to great flavor. I mean if a brother is going to drop $15 on burger and $5 on fries, I am expecting above average. Upon arrival, visually both looked tasty. The meat was very juicy and was impressed. The rest, not so much. Where is the flavor? Where is the salt? Neither existed here. I should not have to salt my own grub when dropping $20 bucks for burger and fries. 

My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad. She thought it tasted okay but again, thought it just did not taste great or even good. My daughter ordered the kids cheeseburger, which came with fries. At $3, this was a great value for what she got. If only I would have dropped her off and my wife and I ate elsewhere.  She thought her meal was great. Kind of sums it up if you ask me. The place hits the flavor palate of a child. 

We did try the vanilla malt and it was tasty. For $5, I would probably order again but doubt this guy will be back.  

In closing, $50 for a family of three here for lunch is a joke when it comes to taste. I have no problem spending that for burgers and fries but know that your customers demand more when they are spending more. I would not recommend and will continue to send my yelpers to Paradise Valley Burger Co."
Negative	"We visited the diner on a Saturday at 5:45.  It was incredibly busy for being so early in the evening, but we were seated immediately which was nice.  Our server was prompt and knowledgeable of the menu.  Unfortunately, the experience went downhill from there.  Our food took almost 50 minutes to arrive - we had four orders and nothing complicated about them.  Our food was room temperature, and honestly, quite a disappointment.  I got the root vegetable hash with eggs and rye toast.  The toast had obviously been sitting there for ages - it was room temperature, and the obscene amount of butter that had drenched the bottom piece.  The eggs were room temperature, and I had asked for them over-easy but they were cooked almost all the way through.  The hash was incredibly bland and cold, and there wasn't a lot of it.  For something that includes parsnips, carrots, etc it really should have had more flavor, but I think the majority of it was potatoes.  Had we had time I would have reordered, but we were trying to make it to a movie.

Our server and the manager of the restaurant were exceptionally understanding and were aware of the issues before we even mentioned them.  On the one hand, that's great that they're so attentive; on the other hand, the fact that they were aware of them without us having to bring it up and steeply discounted our experience makes me think that this is a common occurrence.  I'm afraid we won't be going back there.  It really should only have one star, but I'm adding the extra star for how well their server and manager handled the situation."
Negative	So I bought a new bike from DNA one week ago which I payed $650 for. I got two flats the same day not riding the bike hard at all. I bring the bike back and say hey can you help me out. Well I end up getting charged a extra $50 dollars for tubes. I understand they are in the business of making money but c'mon don't think you could take care of me on this first problem! Not only will I not be going back, but I will make sure to tell anyone I ride with what had happened and to not use those guys. Great relationship building DNA and now you have one more person out there to say you suck, cheers.
Negative	"Ghetto Ghetto. 

I've stayed here twice before and both times was subjected to broken beds. Pretty much all I do in my hotel in Vegas is sleep and shower and a broken bed means the room is about 3/4 useless to me. The first time this happened, I was able to change rooms. On the second trip, the hotel was completely booked and I was stuck in the broken bed room -- and with no discount. On top of that, rooms are very dreary and depressing. 

Plus I hate clowns and there are way too many creepy clowns lurking around Circus Circus."
Negative	After several occassions of enjoying expensive wine on their patio, we were asked to leave after objecting to the blond Matre d's ecouragagement of smoking by females outside the restaurant doors. His attempt at flirting was more important to him than keeping customers and unfortunately we have many other fabulous options in the Kierland area for enjoying  dinner and wine.
Negative	Never returning to this place again! I was really disappointed with the way the staff treats the customers. They told me one price when I went in and a totally different price when it was time to pay. Moreover, the staff tends to talk in their own language, which I find very disrespectful.
Negative	"The restaurant is only getting a one star since I cant give it none. And I guess the service was ok enough to get the 1 star. Also very expensive for the quality/portion.

If you are going for the food, then by all ways avoid this restaurant. We had the lobster rolls and the lobster poutine fries. The portion is very small for the lobster roll, the lobster was flavourless, and the chips that came with their famous lobster roll were uneatable. They were soaked in oil, almost burned and the oil the chips were fried in was apparently over used. 

Their poutine fries was ok, lacked of salt though. 

In short NOT WORTH GOING BACK TO."
Negative	Avoid this place at all costs they will try to take advantage of you!!!!!! Went here to see DJ Snake for EDC pool party and was nearly gypped of my money by their lieing bartenders. I was buying a drink for $21 when she charged my card the receipt said $42!!!! I refused to sign it and she swore that was the last persons bill which was a lie since he  bought 3 drinks. When I checked my bank account a few days later I was charged $59. Overall I would rate it utterly disgraceful out of 10.
Negative	I bought a TV from Sears.com., which was the wrong size. Took it to the Sears store to either return it or match amazons price that was 80.00 less. Was directed to Brian. He took fifteen minutes of running to one computer to the other with my credit card, saying things like external or internal purchase and making excuses about why he couldnt take it back..brand new in the box (never opened).  Told me Sears and sears.com are not the same! Oh really??? Then he had us drive up to the upper level and when we got up there with the packing slip off the box he said yep its external ...cant return it which is what he was hinting about for twenty minutes now. I took the paper got in the car and called Sears.com and they were shocked that any store said they could not take it back. She offered to pricematch the tv online and we kept the TV. Brian as a go to person is a joke and if thats the stores policy I wouldn't buy a thing from them personally.
Negative	This is one of those places, where you give a one star rating, because Yelp forces you to give that at a minimum. My husband and I were on vacation this past week and we wanted to try out some local Arizona wineries. We didn't have an Arizona wine map with us, but our GPS could find some for us. This one happened to be in the direction we were headed, and only 10 minutes out of the way. Great! .... WRONG! They advertise themselves to be a winery and bistro. When we walk in, really all it is, is a restaurant that has wine that you can taste. We go up to the bar to sit, since that is where the wines are kept. The rest is all dining room seating, so we figure this is the easiest route to go, to get a tasting, since we were not there for a meal. We walk up to the bar and sit down and are each handed a sheet, which lists out all of the wines available. Only one-third are Kokopelli wines. The rest are from other vineyards, some were also from New Mexico. Okay... well, we pick some, six each to give the place a fair shot. The lady serving us, poured out the wines. The first in a wine glass and the rest in little shot glasses. We were instructed to follow our sheets, since she poured them down the list, in the order that we picked them. And she walked off. We were shocked to say the least. We are used to when a place tells you it is a winery, with tastings, that this is what they do. We received NO information on any of the wines, she didn't even stick around while we did this. And it's not as if it were a busy time of day, and she was helping other people. There were four waitresses, one other couple at the bar (who got there about 10 minutes after us) and three different sets of people at the tables in the dining room. The wines are very mediocre, we actually liked the New Mexican wines better. Oh, also we got a cheese plate, which tasted like one of the packaged one you get from the store and it sits in the fridge until you open it. Nothing fresh. And also they serve you bread. A HUGE loaf, when only about a third of it is necessary. The bread was okay... I think that it may have been better if it had not been served with a PEPPERY BUTTER. Needless to say, this place is definitely not recommended.
Negative	"More like a 2.5 star. Although I feel bad saying that. Go for the sandwiches.

Went here with my Chilean friend to watch a Chilean soccer match. As Phillip mentions, it´s a tiny hole in the wall type place with 8 tables or so at the back. I think it used to be someone´s house as it seems you are dining in someone´s living room.

The place is tidy but in a really worn out, tired looking building desperately in need of renovations, so this factor adds some grungyness.

They make excellent looking Chilean sandwiches (called completos) which many people seemed to be ordering. 

My friend suggested I try a traditional Chilean dish. It was called a corn cake and the description mentioned chicken. I wasn´t sure what to expect but it came out in a large stone soup bowl and the corn cake was more like a paste or extremely thick soup. It was sweetened with sugar and there was chicken thighs and wings cooked underneath - bones, skin and everything. I was pretty turned off by the bones and my friend said he'd never seen it prepared that way.

Anyway - don't try that dish. Otherwise. You'll be safe."
Negative	Food is good but wife did not like cold pulled pork. Soups are delicious but interior too stark, way too well lit - thought I was auditioning for the Voice and the tables/seats are way too cold. Just okay but probably won't go out of my way to go again.
Negative	"It's McDonald's,  it's what you expect....not everything is god awful bad from McDonald's, but the kids who work at this McDonald's are in serious need of either finding jobs they actually give a damn about or they need fired.  I go thru the drive thru alot for coffees a good portion of the week and the last thing I need is some snot nosed, disinterested,  unpleasant kid handing taking my money and serving my coffee.  They need workers who know how to be pleasant and do their jobs right. 

This McDonald's is the one that's infamous for this therefore it gets a 2."
Negative	"Ordered take-out/delivery for lunch and was less than satisfied.  Salads with ""mixed greens"" came with nothing more than a pile of dry iceberg lettuce.  The veggies on top weren't great quality either.  On top of that, the chicken was missing on top.  (although they did send over a new salad with chicken, I'll give them credit for that).  If they can't build a simple salad according to their own menu description then I'm not about to try them again."
Negative	Stopped here during a layover. We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and Caramel Chicken. They were accommodating of my nut/gluten allergies but the food was extremely salty; we couldn't taste anything except the salt and almost threw it away. The prices are what I'd expect for the portion sizes in an airport, but too high for the low quality. Definitely didn't want all that sodium right before a long flight.
Negative	"Very unhappy with this sprint location I went to here earlier this month to add on a line the lady told me I would have to wait another month, came back 2 hours later and tried again and got the line the lady was also rude and had no customer service kept telling me ""well it could be more"" cause I walked out of the store paying 34 dollars. I then filed a claim through sprint and reported the phone stolen and talked to sprint they told me It would be a 50 dollar deductible and she knew the phone I had , I then get a call 2 days later saying it was gonna be a higher charge after I was already QUOTED 50 from customer care. Sprint does not have there shit together. There insurance plan is basically a waste of money I've been paying insurance the past year and ur telling me that can't cover it? Guess I pay for insurance for no reason"
Negative	"Was in the area of 99th Ave and McDowell and decided to go to Smash Burger.  I ordered a small classic smash burger add mayo easy onion, a smash burger with no onion, and a single order of fries.  It took them 3 tries to get the sandwiches correct, the result being that I had to put the onion on the burger myself.  The french fries were cold, and the the meal was not something I enjoyed.  As I worked my way through the burger, the patty was smashed thin which made it easy to be overcooked, and it was, and dried out.  

I frequent the Smash Burger at I-17 and Happy Valley.  Their Burgers are why I even like Smash Burger to begin with.  I love the burgers there.  I've always gotten nice juicy burgers that make me want to eat the whole thing.  I asked why the difference, and they said they must have different equipment.

As I sat here writing this review, I grew more and more suspicious.  It's BOGO, and the total is feeling like it was too high.  I get a copy of the receipt and sure enough, the BOGO isn't on there.  A certified trainer went and asked the person who took our order about it, and came back to us and said she didn't hear us.  I feel compelled to call this what it was... a lie!  When we placed the order, I told her I had the BOGO offer to which she replied, she knew the code so not to worry.  Why can't they just admit the mistake and apologize for it.  Would have made the experience a little more forgiving.  As it stands, it's a horrible place to eat, the staff can't be trusted, they'll probably make your food wrong, and no matter the offer, GET A RECEIPT! Verify that you were charged correctly.  More and more places are making the issuing of a receipt optional, and they default to no receipt. It's turning out to be a practice best reserved to places you frequently visit, and trust.  All others give me proof. 

Not a place it would recommend to friends or strangers. Now the one off I-17 and Happy Valley, they're awesome.  Never a problem in about 13-15 orders. Every one was just as good as the first."
Negative	"The food was awful, we got shrimp and fillet and oyster combination, it came in a superbig portion, it was terrible, the quality was sooo low. I will not recommend this place to anyone.

Prices are between 35 to 555"
Negative	Ordered pizza tonight at 7pm. It is now 9:05 and the pizza still hasn't been delivered. On top of that every time I try to call the store they hang up on me. Corporate needs to get involved with this location.
Negative	"I previously stayed at Paris and everything was great, but this time was a bit disappointing. Things started off pretty well, although they really need more than two people dealing with the check-in lineup. The wait is long.

We had a beautiful pool-view room on the 23rd floor. The first night was great, because the nightclub was closed. The second night: the bass was booming, the DJ was ""aww ya"" ing, and we were sitting awake until almost 4 in the morning.

I get that Vegas is a party city and there are clubs, but I've never had such a noise issue. This sounded like it was right outside our window. Looking at reviews on various sites this is not a new complaint. What's worse is the canned response everyone gets: ""thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate your feedback so we can make changes"" type thing. 

We called down and they offered to switch rooms, so the next day we went to the front desk, got our new key cards and headed upstairs. Packed up our old rooms and arrived at a dirty room with maids just starting to clean it. By this time we'd left our old room keys and were just standing there with all our luggage. 

We called down to the front desk, who sent someone up with new cards to a new room. Someone who maybe took a lunch break before they came upstairs. No sense of urgency to fix the problem. Finally someone came up and we got our third room. 

The two stars are for the clean room, nice casino atmosphere, great pool area and delicious pizza place near the lobby."
Negative	It's UNBELIEVABLE how many times these guys mess my order up. Time and time again and it's always the same issue. The drivers don't read the labels or whoever is preparing their deliver messes it up. Over and over again. I've been a customer for years and the same problem reoccurs.
Negative	"I came to this venue to see Andy Grammer perform and it was definitely an interesting experience. Andy put on an amazing show but I'm not really rating him but the venue. 

The venue was small and in a bad part of town. I felt unsafe walking to the venue from Bloor. When we arrived we got in quickly but they did check our bags quite thoroughly. It's good for security of all guests but I felt like it was a bit much. 

The coat check had barely anyone in line when we dropped off and picked up our coats. This made it easy to get to the floor to watch the show and leave once the show was over.

This show didn't have a lot of people, so I'm not sure how it would fare on a busier night. The crowd was very chill but I am a little nervous to go back in a few weeks for a bigger show when the floor will be crowded. My boyfriend says it's always crowded at this venue and I'm not really a fan of that environment.

I will update my review after round two!"
Negative	"My daughters and their friends were there to select bridesmaids dresses. The man that helped them was blunt and rude. He would not call them by their name, BUT BY THEIR DRESS SIZE!!!! 7 beautiful young ladies, from size 0 to size 14, all having the entire store full of customers know their sizes! No class! Of course, in our society, the girls would not call him out on it. They were too polite. As a father, I think I would have twisted that man's neck shut. 
Never using them for my girls wedding!"
Negative	"My review has a movie title, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
The Good includes convenient location near Summerlin Parkway. E85 and diesel are fuel options.

 The Bad. Please have receipt tape ready at the pump! 
When headed to an appointment or traveling with my children, being prompted to See Clerk for a receipt is INCONVIENT! This morning, pump #8 is out of tape.

The Ugly. It's Wednesday. The lot looks like a night after a frat party. Each of the 6 trash bins are spilling over with plastic bottles and refuse. Cigarette butts are scattered. There's a grime layered across the floor of the entrance. Here my plea: schedule a power wash service and maintain some cleanliness here."
Negative	"I've had nothing but problems at Towbin Kia. My wife and I wanted to deal with the sales department through email or texting, but the sales guy wouldn't. We ended up spending a good portion of two days sitting in their showroom waiting for things to happen after repeatedly being told it would take just 45 minutes. We spend over 6 hours trying to trade in my 2015 Mazda CX-5 with almost 47,000 miles on it. 

When I finally got to the point where I could sit down with someone in the finance department, there were so many mistakes that I should have walked out. They had my trade-in with nearly 70,000 miles on it, they had no idea about the 60 months 0% APR financing that I'd been approved for the previous day, and they added on $850 in gap insurance that I initially declined.

I was also told that I would receive a $400 check to pay for registration. I have yet to receive that. I paid for the extended warranty that should have come with a box of Zurich Shield supplies. I still haven't received that. 

After reminding them that I had been approved for 60 months at 0% APR, I was offered two different financing terms. One was for 60 months and one was for 72. I was told both were 0% APR, but when I calculated the totals, only the 60 month loan was 0% APR. The 72 month loan had over $3,500 in additional charges that the finance guy couldn't explain, but he assured me it was also 0% APR. I chose the one that truly had 0% APR.

After all that, I had to wait a week for my new car to be delivered from somewhere in California. This didn't bother me a bit, but I wasn't allowed to leave with my Mazda because Towbin Kia now owned it. This also didn't bother me until I checked my bank statements over two weeks later and I was/am still making payments on the trade in and that loan is still in my name, even though it is up for sale on the Towbin Kia website.

So I am currently still making payments on a vehicle that Towbin Kia is actively trying to sell.

When I filled out the feedback survey, I was offered a free oil change for my trouble. What I really want is my Mazda back. I regret ever considering Towbin Kia for a new vehicle."
Negative	"Extraordinarily disappointed with the quality and value of the service we received from Effinity Solutions.

Ordered carpet and tile floor cleaning for our vacant 1,200 sqft Phoenix home. After they missed their first appointment, we had to rearrange our schedule to accommodate their next available appointment. When they finished, carpets were still dirty and stain we asked them to address was still there. And even though we were billed for cleaning all of the tile in the home, they completely missed the tile under the refrigerator and between the washer and dryer, which were easy to get to (you can roll the refrigerator out of the way with one hand). Their tile cleaning also left a sticky, white haze on the tile and grout. We ultimately had to go back and clean the carpet and tile ourselves. 

We basically feel like we wasted our money and got ripped off. Owner doesn't admit fault, and does not honor their ""30-day satisfaction guarantee"" printed on the back of their invoices. We weren't asking for our money back, just wanted the carpet and tile cleaned to an acceptable level.

We don't enjoy leaving negative feedback, but we are extremely disappointed and don't feel like Effinity Solutions cares. There is so much competition when it comes to carpet cleaning, we recommend that homeowners spend their money elsewhere."
Negative	"I called office to make follow up appointment from ER visit for kidney stone 

When I called the office at 3:30, their answering service answered and took message.

Their office returned my call at 4:30pm. The woman stated that dr Newman's next available appointment was on 6/11/18.  I asked, what about the advertisement on their website for same day or next day appointments (see picture).  She said that no appointments were available and to possibly call around to other physicians.

False advertising on website and poor customer service."
Negative	"I decided to take the cats here (instead of Northview Animal Hospital, where I'd been going for years) because Hart's Run is closer to where I live.  We'll be switching back to Northview.  The vet we saw (Dr. Hall) was ok, but the staff was scatter-brained and inattentive.  I've gotten appointment reminder calls from them for appointments that were cancelled.  My suggestion to install hooks in the exam room to hang up my purse or jacket was met with excuses, giggles, and the brush-off.  In the two exam rooms I've been in, there is only one chair in each (with a rounded back, so you cannot hang your purse there), and there are no tables or surfaces for your purse (I can't stand putting my purse on the floor).

Also, I think their prices are somewhat high - almost $200 per cat to confirm fleas in both and an ear problem in one."
Negative	"Save your money there are many other places in Mississauga better than the Open Cork.
I was there on Sunday (Oct 22nd, 2017) and had one of the worst experiences ever. If not for my friend who was celebrating her birthday there, I would have left without even trying the food. The service was TERRIBLE, maybe it was because we had a big group, but many of our orders were wrong, they had no clue who ordered what, and my wife waited 20 minutes to get a plate, cutlery and a glass of water.
We were hoping the food would make up for the initial experience, but oh boy how wrong we were... our table had 10 people and only 4 of them actually finished their meal. Undercooked pasta, raw veal and cold vegetables was just the beggining. 
After talking to everyone on our table, they all agreed that this is not a place worth ever coming back to.

I hope you read this review before coming to this place."
Negative	Super slow. 7 customers and all waiting in line for about 20 to 30 min. Do t know if it was the manager but the 2 lady's In the back talking the phone
Negative	I spent 4 weeks in Brazil and never had anything like the food served here. The waitress is really nice and the place is reasonable nice. We had dinner within the last week and I can say that the food provided was nothing remotely Brazilian, everything we had was deep fried and extremely salty. The tap beer is not recommended.We went to this place from the reviews on Yelp but these review are misguiding. Sorry about the bad review
Negative	Ahhh... the Dirty Duff... if you like screaming kids, parents in track suits and the usual rif raf that comes with a mall sporting a giant Wal Mart out front, then go here. The people watching is truily epic, if you sit down and take a time out from the crowds. Skids, deadbeats, turbos, grandpas going commando... it's all here!
Negative	This place has lost my business. What kind of place doesn't put potatoes in a breakfast burrito? Then you want to charge me for a side of fries as a substitute. I really liked this place. Sucks the owners are greedy bastards.
Negative	I dropped by today because it was the only place open on December 26th.  I have not been in a while since I consistently get bad Amercano's that are very blond (bad crema). Once again, another bad double shot was pulled. PLEASE train your staff to use the $15K+ Kees van der Westen espresso machine properly.  The Canary district location has it's shiza sorted out.
Negative	Descent pizza for the price. Absolute crap for service. I stopped using there delivery because it would take an hour and a half to get a pizza. Well picking up has got just as bad. They say 30 min and I show up in 20 and got attitude for asking about my pizza after sitting for another 20 min. 45 min to PICK UP a pepperoni pizza. Not worth it!
Negative	"They must be under new management/ownership...Because this company is awful now!!!

WOW.....I must say, I am quite impressed with the amount of negative reviews on this shippers site, but like most reviews with the good, must come the bad.....And I am here as an honest review that is an extremely happy customer.

I personally had an incredible experience with DAS. I phoned them up and made arrangements for my car to be delivered from California to Atlanta...Bernie my customer service agent was incredibly nice and very understanding.

I was given the exact quote, you pay the exact amount over the phone(when your car is dropped at the terminal)  and BOOM your car is there..It took 1 week and 6 days for me to receive my vehicle from the West Coast on the exacttttt date. I received emails of the cars location while in transition up until arrival. 

I wil admit, I was very VERY hesitant shipping my car due to the fact that the reviews were not great on Yelp, but I had the advice of 2 different friends who had used them(1 friend used them twice) and had zero issues. I mean, I may be a risk taker, but this was definitely a success and will use them going forward.

It may be the particular season, but my car was $900.00 and I own a luxury suv. Unheard of....It was definitely the cheapest of all the quotes I used."
Negative	"Ok, so here's the deal. This place is special... for Charlotte. I say that because the craft cocktail lounge has been perfected in other geos and this place still has farther to go. Good news is, their mistakes are common ones, bad news is those mistakes have more to do with the culture and mindset of management and, thus, may be hard to overcome.  

There seems to be a serious disconnect between the ideology of the place set forth by the owners and talent (I.e. bar manger, mixologists) and the group the customers interface with (hosts and servers). The drinks are fancy and interesting and crafted with an aesthetic that makes you think there are experts behind the the recipes. Yet, ask the server a simple question and they know very little about what they are delivering. Ours was confused about gin versus vodka and I'm fairly certain she's never had a decent drink in her life. She was also cavalier about the swapping out of tequilas in a particular mixed drink as if they are all the same. An experienced or well trained server, even one that doesn't know bev, could have at least faked it. 

Lastly, when the drinks/ food was delivered it was placed on top of my handbag which happened to be a vintage Ferragamo clutch. The bottom of the tartar plate left behind a pickled red onion which I didn't notice until it was time to go. By then, the oil and vinegar had seeped into the delicate magenta silk, leaving behind a stain. The server noticed it when I did and her reaction to it was one of, 'oh well, at least it wasn't something valuable'. 

Besides the bag being very expensive ($1000+), it has sentimental value (I bought it for my engagement dinner and used it very few times since then). Look, I know s@&t happens. Lovely things get messed up when you take them out. I didn't expect anyone to fix it but, again, this shows the staffs lack of understanding of, not only what they are serving, but who they are serving it to. Most people willing to pay seventeen dollars for a cocktail are willing to pay a high price for craftsmanship.  A characteristic which likely extends beyond their glass and, if they are a woman, to their handbag. 

A little training on what they are serving and who they are serving to, could go a long way here to ensure the Dot .. vision does not fall apart during execution."
Negative	"My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Diego and were looking for a good happy hour.  The two-for-ones brought us to this place.  The vibe seemed pretty good, the music was pretty good but the people watching was actually the best.  The bartender staff were pretty wild and seemed to be having a great time.  There was also a speed dating event going on - pretty ""40 year old virgin"" ish.  

This is an interesting crowd as there were a number of guys with shaved heads - is that an Arizona thing or is it symbolic of something else?   The crowd demographics are either young or old and not much in between.  

The appetizer food that looked good on line sucked!  Although cheap, you got what you paid for.  We had crab cakes, chicken wings, calamari rings and french fries.  French fries were way over cooked and too brown; calamari was chewy; and the chicken wings were fried too long.  

If you want cheap entertainment, go there but don't expect good drinks or food - just good, old fashioned people watching!"
Negative	"The last time I was at the Spice Market Buffet was about three years ago.  I am improving this place by just one star; however, overall I still likely would not return again in the future.

We came to Spice Market with two people on a Saturday evening at about 8:45PM.  This place suffers from utter disorganization. There is one hostess that was seating people, and there was no order like other buffets. At other buffets they usually have multiple people hosting and taking care of tables.  This place...not at all.  We actually walked around the restaurant three times with her, while she waited for a busser to clean off a table.  It was ridiculous. She had no idea where she was taking us.

The good news and the reason for my one star improvement is the food truly was better.  Almost everything I had was good to very good.  I was pleased with the food and the taste and quality seemed to be improved.

The one thing that made me more upset than anything else, was the fact that they have eliminated all service from this buffet.  I believe in tipping, and I believe in tipping at or above the normal rate.  I believe service people work very hard.  Even at a buffet, I tip.  Therefore, when I entered, because you pay upon arrival, I tipped $5.00 (which I feel is appropriate for limited service at a buffet).   However, to my surprise, after getting to the table -- I was shocked to find out that there is no longer service at this buffet. That is correct folks -- they have completely 100% eliminated all service.  Other buffets usually have drink service...not this one.  You get everything on your own.  Is that a problem?  No, it is not.  However, there should be absolutely no gratuity line on the receipt.  In fact, when you went up to get a drink, they wanted a tip. When you went to the crepe station, they wanted a tip.  There is no excuse for this and it reflects negatively on Planet Hollywood and this buffet."
Negative	"Went here for a few drinks and dinner last night, and was not in the least bit impressed with the food or the service. The bartender/waitress basically hated her job and it showed. Not personable, not nice. Ordered the 7.99 Mediterranean salad, and got the smallest dinner salad I've ever seen. I'm not complaining about the price, moreso the portion size. It was equivalent to a side salad. Thanks for putting me on a diet, friends. 

The only reason this place is worthy of two stars is the cheap happy hour drinks drinks. Go for drinks, pass on the food."
Negative	"Restaurant Review

Went here on a date last night. The food and the date were the same: DRY & UNAPPETIZING!

When we sat down they brought salty chips & salsa to the table. Gee thanks.
Waiter takes order and disappears for the rest of the night...lucky. I should've done the same.
Date ordered beer, (seemed pleased) I ordered water (I don't drink, but I should've bought an ""Adios Mother F*cker"" to ease the pain of this date!).
For appetizers, The Man Who Will Now Have A Relationship With My Voicemail ordered a bean/queso dip concoction...FAIL!! He also ordered us taquitos. SURVEY SAYS: EPIC FAIL!!

For the main dish, we *gags* both ordered chicken enchiladas. Dear Cooks, Chefs, and Owners of Yolos,

WHEN IT IS YOUR JOB TO MAKE MEXICAN FOOD, AND YOU FAIL TO MAKE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CHICKEN ENCHILADA, IT IS TIME TO ASK YOURSELF: WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!!

Will Yolos and The Guy That Doesn't Have My New Number ever see me again? Probably not, and by probably...I mean definitely."
Negative	"Don't go here. I've been here multiple times, and it consistently takes over an hour to get your food. The latest visit was especially offending. Let me relegate my story.

We got there at 6:45 on Taco Tuesday, and immediately ordered our beer and tacos. The beer came. The tacos didn't. So we ordered another beer, and they came. Again, no tacos. After an hour, we excitedly see our tacos come out, only to go straight to another table that came half an hour after us. We tried to cancel our food and leave, but nobody could even find our bill. Turns out our waitress left without telling us, or putting another server on our table! 

We left and went to home & away across the street and it was amazing!"
Negative	AWFUL!!!  Walked in and got seated by hostess, waited 30 minutes with no service..  Walked up to hostess stand requesting service..  Finally waitress comes, takes 20 minutes to deliver drinks and then takes orders..  35 minutes later 5 people in our party receive meals at our table and they lost the other 2 orders..  Absolutely, positively the worst restaurant experience I've ever had..  So bad I signed up for a Yelp account to warn others.  Thank God we live in Atlanta but warning to locals, this place is abhorrent!!!
Negative	"Honestly, I haven't had worst service ever! Waited for a table for 10 minutes and their were tables open and clean everywhere. Water came to the table with coffee grounds in it. Our server, Lisa, was no where to to be found after taking our order. A different person delieverd our food and we had to ask the ""retail leader"" for our check. He printed and delivered it and we were on our way out the door to never return. We normally go to Brookpark rd. and everything is usually fine. This one was not fine. Steer clear."
Negative	Ordered some apps at the bar. Too much going on with the food. Nothing made sense nor did it come close to wowing me. The bar smells terrible. The corner by the dishwasher definitely has something going on. Needs a deep cleaning of some sort. Smells like mold and sulfer had a baby. Thank God Mariah just killed it and I was in a good mood.
Negative	If I could give this place zero stars I would. 7/12 people in our party got food poisoning from eating at Pink Taco. Within two hours of leaving, people starting vomiting and having diarrhea. We were there to celebrate a joyous occasion and were there for only two nights. Unfortunately one of our nights was ruined by food poisoning from this terrible place. When attempts were made to report the multiple cases of food poisoning in our party, we were met with rudeness and zero sympathy. The manager did not seem to care or be worried about other customers getting sick. Instead, we were told that have to go to the hospital to prove that we had food poisoning, when multiple people in the group are physicians and know how to diagnosis food poisoning. DO NOT GO HERE. Avoid this place at all cost! Protect your health!
Negative	I will NEVER EVER send business EVER to One Guard. I gave them multiple chances to fix this problem and they choose to stand their ground. When you call my husband over and over and over in March 2014 hounding him to renew the policy during a time that he is taking care of a 6 week old baby and a Wife who just had Kidney Cancer surgery, a 5 year old, and he had just returned home 4 months prior from serving a tour in Afghanistan. I don't blame him for being overwhelmed and wanting your insistent phone calls to go away, and telling you he wants to cancel. I apologize that renewing a policy during a time of kidney cancer, CT Scans, a newborn baby and hospital visits was not his main priority. We have FINALLY been able to settle back into a routine and my health has been stabilized (Thank You God) We realized we did not renew when we had a minor item come up. We set up a BRAND NEW policy and called 4 days after signing up. You THEN want to tell me that you will not service this issue because we did not call on July 1st when the policy goes into effect, and this is now a pre-existing issue? I gave ALL of the details to our situation to you and you decided to NOT BUDGE AT ALL. That absolutely sickens me and shows me that you treat your clients like cattle not human beings with true issues. To ALL of the Agent's who I used to tell only use One Guard. I take it ALL back!!! If this would have happened to one of my Team's clients, I would physically be sick to my stomach. I am thinking of sending this to the news stations because I will make it my mission NOBODY is treated this way. Shame on you. Seriously SHAME ON YOU.
Negative	This apartment is horribly manage. They will let anyone live in this place (i.e. people with drug problems, alcohol problems, car thief's, people that may look like they are going to attack you, possible drug dealers...etc.) they don't care about the safety of the children that live there. There is still a room that is still under investigation and it's been there for almost a year. There would also be times when a whole section smells like drugs. This apartment also have some very ridiculous fees, and rules( for example. you would have to pay $300 per dog that is going to live with you.). I'm sorry but it looks more like the managers care more about money than the safety of the people. If the managers want to make better business then they will have to make more than a few changes. However I do not recommend families living here because there are people that are bad influence for children.
Negative	Delivery driver called to say he was here and didn't appear for another 5 minutes so waited outside in the cold   He then came without a pen for a credit card order which required a signature.  Order was incorrect and cold.  Called and was told that many of their drivers are new and do not speak English very well.  They were very nice on the phone and offered a free appetizer on a future order, but none of this helps now.  You have to get it right the first time, every time.
Negative	Horrible nail place!  Very dirty and unprofessional.  Tina the manager is not concerned with the appearance of your nails or with providing you a pleasant experience.  This was my FIRST and LAST time in this disgusting salon.  So disappointed*
Negative	"This was a horrible Christmas dinner! The olive oil for the bread was old and tasted like foil. 
Our waitress brought our salad out without croutons. She said, ""We ran out of croutons,  so you get a naked salad."" I ordered the momma trio. The Alfredo sauce tasted like somone dumped the entire salt container in it.  My lasagna was cold in the middle and the chicken parmesan was an oily mess. My husband ordered the classic Italian bake. The sauce was extra spicy.  We had to send both back. The wait between items were way too long. Especially since I could see every item we ordered waiting on the counter and being moved around. 


We watched servers pick up, hold for two min and place other people food back on the counter.  One server offered the same two salads to three different tables."
Negative	I want to service my car.  I want to buy my parts here directly from my dealer in my neighborhood.  But unfortunately the chat bot put me through a guy who has the day off today so I spent three phone calls calling directly to find someone else that can help me.  I was thrilled when I finally found Dan and assumed that this would be the end of my troubles.  And even though I called back twice, no one has gotten back to me to let me know if they have my parts or not and now I will go if you more days without my daughter having a working car.  I will update this review if and when they decide to help me
Negative	"WARNING!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT USE THIS WOMAN:Horrible service!!!!!!!!!!!- came to her to have the name changed on my house deed and to add my spouse- I should have known better because while we were sitting there she had misplaced the paperwork that I had just signed, within a few sconds and she became frantic- findly found the paperwork-my husband paid cash because he was uncomfortable with giving his debit card info to her- she stated that the deed will record the next business day which was a Monday- i checked the following Wednesday and it was recorded incorrectly. It still had my maiden name and my husband was indeed added- I reached out to Kay via email and she said that the Clark County Recorders Office filed the deed incorrectly-that she would have them to correct, in which she did and it was updated in 2 days- afterwards I called to see if I could come by and pick up the new deed and our original marriage certificate in which we provided to her at her request-We had previously asked that we come to pick up the paperwork because we did not want her to mail it- we were TRYING to avoid such paperwork being lost in the mail- She never answered the phone and so I emailed her- She emailed me back stating she did not know where our paperwork is located, that it is lost for now- didnt apologize- Today she sends me an email saying that all of our personal paperwork is lost-that she will order a new marriage certificate and deed to replace- I asked her for a refund- she emailed me back "" GET LOST-YOURE A JERK""- this dreadful woman still has not apologized- very very unprofessional and rude"
Negative	"My rating is because I cannot give Zero.

Never never use this company, they are everything you hear about Bad Moving Companies. My experience is this is the best example of bait and switch in moving. Should you choose them, get everything in writing prior to them starting work, Trust nothing they say, watch the workers, supervisor slowed down the crew all day and so much more."
Negative	I love this place I've been coming here for years, prices are great, service is great. My favourite place for sure. UPDATE: I hate this place, they will sit me down and have me wait hours just for a gel manicure, over charge me, and not even do a good job. Never going there again
Negative	We were here once before when my friend turned 50 and the gathering was great and the chips/salsa and guacamole were delicious.  So we decided to go back for a meal.  The service was decent but not great.  We sat in the bar on the Sunday during the Masters golf tournament so I asked the bartender to turn it from a movie to the Masters and it took a couple of reminders to have them change it.   Once we got our wine, chips and salsa were delivered and the mild was a lot hotter than we remember but it was still good.  My wife ordered the Stacked Enchiladas and requested Manchego cheese only since it is sheeps milk and she cannot have any cow dairy.  When the food was delivered, it had other cheese all over so they had to take it back and get her another one.  When the new plate came out, it was missing the egg on top.  Needless to say, the meal want sideways and we couldn't wait to get out of there fast enough.  Did they really expect me to start eating when my wife didn't have her food yet?  By the time it came, mine was cold.  I had the tacos and they were okay but I think I was already influenced by the lack of attention and the food not coming out the right way.  I hate to say it but we won't be going back.   Maybe we just caught them in a bad day.
Negative	"I bought the 23.99 car wash (with some hesitation) I was told that it was ""the most"" popular. I was assured that it would be done to my satisfaction. My first clue that this was't going well was when my car came out of the wash line with soap all over the back end. When I was called to get my car there was water spots all over it, water was dripping down in some areas, there were smudges that I had to have taken care of, I was very disappointed. My next stop was the gas station when I saw that the tie dressing that was applied was slung all over the bottom of my car! Very unhappy with this service."
Negative	I love Chipotle. My experience at this location is always different. Today was probably my last time at the location. The girl behind the counter barely sprinkled an cheese on my bowl. I know they do that with the meat but the cheese? Come on. She gave me a rude look when I asked her for more. To make matters worse, I found a short, straight hair in my food that I know was not mine (my hair is long and curly). I will never be going there again. Their customer service was not too great as well. I rather drive further to get better service with no hair in my food.
Negative	"i met with Dr. Gage recently for a complimentary 20 minute consultation and he seemed very knowledgeable.  He said the next step would be getting labs done and a follow up appointment would be $200.00.  During my follow up appointment Dr. Gage did a great job explaining the lab work and what that means for my health.  However, at the end of the appointment I am told my treatment plan will be $6,000 for 6-7 months of treatment.  This felt very ""bait and switch"" to me, as he could have given a range in treatment plan costs during the consultation and not after I pad him $200.00.   

I am sure he is a good doctor and has helped many but I am disappointed in the time and money I wasted, which could have been avoided if he was upfront about the cost of treatment during the consultation."
Negative	Lay off about my windshield having pitting.  We own a glass shop. Good car wash but ignore them about their con with your windshield repair.  Hate coming here because they harass you and then follow you into where you pay about it.  Closest car wash to our house  but this is stupidity at its best.
Negative	Grossly understaffed. Waited 2 hours. While waiting for a table, we saw a half drank Gatorade bottle in the ice container where they would get ice for the cocktails. At one point the bartender scooped the container up with the ice and just moved it to the side and proceeded to scoop more ice from the same spot to make someone's drink.  Food wasn't worth the money and it was cold by the time we got silverware and napkins.
Negative	So I called this place to find out if they have Christmas trees and they assured me that they did and even asked me what kind of Christmas tree, so I  drove 30 minutes out of the way to pick up the tree once I get there the only Pinetrees they had were the little outdoor trees and then told me the real Christmas trees wouldn't be arriving until next week. This is why I called and advance. Thanks for wasting my time!!!!
Negative	"I was pretty disappointed on my visit upon check in when I was hit with a ""resort fee""  This negative wasteful charge really set the tone of my stay.  Be up front and charge me the real price when I book a room."
Negative	"I would give our experience zero stars. Possible negative stars. It's Valentine's Day. An order was placed weeks in advance for a delivery. My boyfriend went to the shop to ask where the delivery was and the woman at the counter could not have cared less that he was perturbed. Weather conditions are not ideal for deliveries today but no attempt was made to communicate that the delivery would be delayed. Just a little ""hey, someone is sending you something special, we're doing the best we can"". Placate us! 

I received a call at 5:30 saying I needed to be home to receive the delivery! Where's the surprise in that? What if it's just a regular day and I'm getting surprise flowers, would I have to get them myself if I wasn't home? Well, my flowers are not being delivered today. My arrangement is sitting at the shop because I was chosen to be the loser of ""who gets their flowers on time"". 

The surprise of my arrangement was also ruined by the shop when they said what it was, how beautiful it was and I'd be very happy. Well, we're not happy at all about the service. At all. Don't know how this place is still in business with the awful customer service.


Edit: my flowers were delivered at 1:05 on 2/15 after I told the shop they needed to be delivered by 1:00. They were given a range of 9-1. I was offered a box of Whitman's chocolate as an apology. Really? How about a refund. The arrangement my boyfriend selected is gorgeous but the flowers are wilted and spotted already. I'm pretty sure they ruined any future chances of me getting surprise delivery flowers."
Negative	**UPDATE** after posting my online reviews I was contacted by the staff who let me know that after reading my review they were willing to offer me half a refund. I'm glad to see that they met me half way just sucks that it was only after I spoke my mind about the business. Thank you anyway.
Negative	"This daycare is one of the worst places you could send your child to or work as a teacher. 

First of all, the rooms are constantly over ratio, meaning that very often there are more children in the room than what the law states. There were days with 24 children in a room where 16 are supposed to be. No good education can happen in a room that is total chaos because of such high numbers.

Second, there is an extremely high turnover ratio, employees constantly quit because they can't take the horrible working conditions anymore. If employees are happy they stay, happy employees work better, unhappy employees quit.

Thirdly, your child will receive close to no education here. Even though the daycare says they have a curriculum, in essence this means, that the teachers have 30 minutes to let 14-18 kids complete a craft, resulting in about 1-2 minutes per child. Most often, there is not even a curriculum because the management once more did not make one.  

Fourth, the teachers do not get proper training, and basically everybody is hired, no matter their background or education, because people constantly quit and they constantly need workers. 

Fifth, the place is dirty all the time, because over-tired employees have to clean their rooms. Rooms that have not been updated in years, that have often non-working A/C units, and filthy toilets, and I mean really filthy, where toilets are not cleaned for weeks.

Sixth, if you ever had/have the pleasure to stay during lunch you will understand why your child is hungry when he/she comes home. The food is usually out of cans or packets, with no seasoning, no nutritional value, overcooked, and looks like it had been eaten already. That's because the cook spends more time gossiping about anything going on around the school, than taking care of the kitchen.

Seventh, the teachers are constantly forced to switch room, which means that your infant might see well over 5 teachers in one day, causing major attachment problems. 

Eighth, in the infant room, you baby might cry for over half an hour and not be picked up, because the employees are forced to look after so many children. Once again this can cause major attachment problems and insecurity issues later in life.

This is not a disgruntled employee writing this, this is someone who has had first hand experience in this unprofessional and poorly managed so called day care. center."
Negative	If I could give no stars I would. I will not be coming to this labcorp again. I had an 11:15am appointment. I walk in at 1040am to nobody at the front desk. I sign in and take a seat. A lady from the back finally comes up at 11:00am. There were 2 other men waiting for a drug test. She called one back, he left. Another 10 mins pass and the other guy waiting got fed up and sat right in front of the door because he thought they forgot about him. While the second guy is walking back, another Lady walked in and is waiting at the desk. He tells her and she responds with its okay, they can wait. She can't even  You've been waiting awhile... At 1140 the lady comes up and finally asks me what I'm waiting for. I tell her and give her my paperwork she then tells me they don't take my insurance that I need to go to quest. Why isn't there someone at the front? If there was somebody at the front checking people in I wouldn't of have to wait an hour to be told I had to go somewhere else. They obviously need more people on staff.
Negative	"I get a massage a week because I'm on my feet all day at work.  This place wasnt awful by any means... but ut was far from fantastic.  Below average really.  

I won't be back with so many other options."
Negative	Have ordered from Palermo's before and delivery has always been slow. Tonight delivery took 2 hours. Called after 1hr 15 minutes and was told all deliveries were out and should be there soon. So Pizza and wings rode around in a car for 45+ minutes. Everything was cold and disgusting. Called owner to complain and he wanted to give us $7 off a $45 delivery!! Will NEVER order from them again.
Negative	Went to try the infamous meatball cone. The flavor of food was very good. I will say it did not arrive very hot and was cold before I was done. The staff working the register was less than friendly - while the staff cleaning tables was very nice. Saw customers showing other customers how to use the wine machine while there was other staff not doing anything. Concept is cool - execution seems flawed.
Negative	The food and drinks were just ok. Drinks were weak and food was bland. The view and the ambiance of the place are amazing. It was super cool to see 360 views of Las Vegas. My low rating is due to their customer service. With the exception of our waitress, the hostess and even the manager of the restaurant made us feel like we needed to leave once we were done. My friends and I went to walk around the restaurant once we were done with dinner and the manager told us we were not allowed to just walk around and asked us to leave. Horrible customer service! After spending a considerable amount of money on dinner, they just want you out. Other than the views, I don't recommend this restaurant for its food and customer service. It's not worth the money with their customer service!
Negative	"They had a ladies night here a few weeks back. A male review. The facility is old and needs to be re done. 
Like the first reviewer it definitely has a smell. I'm not sure of balls and ashtray but its something alright. I'll pass on the next event they offer here."
Negative	"The americano was fine and the chai tea soy latte was below par.  The problem was that we ordered and tried to pay with a Timothy's gift card.  It didn't work and the girl said that they usually don't work.  It seems to me that if the cards don't usually work, you could try putting up a sign at the till that says, I don't know, something like ""Not accepting gift cards"" or something similar.  We only went in there to use up the gift card as we'd had it for a while.  We paid with debit (that worked fine in the same machine) and now we still have the darn gift card.  Looks like we'll have to try to use it up at another location."
Negative	They are one of the most unethical and unprofessional car-rental companies that I have ever dealt with. They are truly dishonest and crooks! NEVER fall for their cheap rates. When you come to return the car, they have already charged you for things you never agreed in the first place. They charge you for insurance even if you refuse it. This is a horrible company.
Negative	"A Groupon experience that we should have skipped. The positives were attentive waitstaff and a great bartender. Also, the bread and the dipping oil was quite good.
The negatives were in fact all of the food. My husband's osso bucco was edible, but seasoned oddly. My veal piccata was an oily salt lick. I sent it back and in only 15 to 20 minutes, I received an overcooked dry little pizza. Ucck! This experience was so disappointing! 
We will return only for their Wednesday Martini happy hours."
Negative	You'd think I'd stop trying to go here- My transmission started to go out, and I happened to be right across the street, so I coasted into the parking lot, only to be told they were too busy to help me. I went to Ted Weins, and will only take my business there from now on.
Negative	"Update: received a message from Amy, incredibly kind and understanding of why I was frustrated about the unintentional cut. Good to know they care so much about retaining a customer. Thanks Amy!

The one star is for the cut on my foot. I don't know the guy's name because he didn't tell me. However during the callus removal he was going way too fast and cut my foot. It took him a few minutes to acknowledge that he did this. It hurt like hell. Thankfully Li Yen was doing my boyfriends pedicure in the next chair and jumped in to take care of my foot. Li Yen deserves 10 stars if you go here do your self a favor and request her. I doubt after this experience I will want to risk it again. The most frustrating part was that what I am guessing is the manager came over to ask what happened. When I went to pay the same guy didn't say anything just charged me for 2 pedicures like my foot wasn't damaged, no apology. Super disappointed this place is very cute and the woman I spoke to when I scheduled my appointments and Li Yen were fantastic."
Negative	"Price tag shock - Earls is really expensive.  We came for lunch on a Sunday.  We ordered a Reuben Sandwich with Fries ($16) and a Fish and Chips with Slaw and Fries ($23).  The portion of both were generous, but at these prices, I would be seriously disappointed otherwise.  The Reuben strangely came with a chunk of smoked beef, not sliced smoked beef.  My BF said it tasted good.  The fish and chips was well fried.  The fish was fresh.  The tartar sauce was regrettably not tangy enough, so much so that I used a lot on each bite and not having enough tartar sauce near the end.

The services was slow as the restaurant was understaffed.  There was only 1 waiter for the whole section where we sat.  He was polite and friendly, though.

Just a note that no music was played during lunch time.

Food: 3 stars
Overall value: 2.5 stars.  This rating can be easily improved with faster services."
Negative	"I will give the coffee 5 stars but Service, order accuracy would get none if I could. 

Asked for hot coffee with caramel and was give two iced coffees. Asked for a biscuit sandwich with egg and sausage, arrived at window and was told they are out and would I take a croissant. I said yes. The sandwich was horrible, the croissant was hard and taste was something I could not describe.  At least the sausage was edible. Then pulled the hash rounds out of the bag.....I kid you not.....they were soaked like they were wet ......I didn't even try them. I will never go to this Dunkin Donuts again, and most likely never buy anything but Coffee."
Negative	"Getting in this place is a nightmare and I still don't understand why.
I was there with my boyfriend tonight and we just wanted a table for 2 on the patio. 
On our way in, we walked by 4 empty patio tables so we didn't understand why the wait was out the door. When we got in near the host stand, there were about 6 other tables in my view alone that were empty as well.

People kept coming over to the host stand asking why it was taking so long and the host staff were SO RUDE. The one girl was throwing attitude at everyone and people kept asking her why she was seating people who just came in before people who had been waiting for over 40 mins.

Her excuse was ""oh, we tried to find you""

This one man was livid and yelled back ""I've been standing 6 feet away from you for 40 minutes!"" She then miraculously found him a table. Go figure. 

When we finally got to the host stand, we asked for a table for 2 and she said it would be an HOUR! For a table for two. The place is massive!

We were so fed up that we left, walking by a bunch of empty tables on our way out.

It's so bizarre to me that that they have tons if empty tables but they just watch customers walk out instead of filling them?

The only reason this place even got a 2 was because it's stunning! Beautiful location and gorgeous design.  

I won't be back though.
There are a million places in Toronto where you CAN get a table."
Negative	"When I passed by this place there was a man who was offering free chicken samples. I decided to order from this place. I asked the man if there was a special and he told me that the special of the day was the chicken shawarma plate for 7.49 and that it came with chicken, rice, salad and potatoes. I told him I would get the special. The service was great until I got to the cash. I had to pay 11 dollars. I asked if it was the special and the lady turned to the manager and the manager told me no, it's not the special. I explained that I asked for the special and he demanded that I pay. The meat was dry, was not worth my money.
This location gets an extra star than what it deserves because of the decor. Everything is nicely laid out and visible so that when you order, it's easier for you to choose what you want. I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful."
Negative	"Kicked it here for a couple hours last Saturday. It was $10/hr for a regular table and $1/hr for the quarter operated smaller tables. We played by the hour. The two types of tables are mixed together throughout the place and are pretty beat up. The aren't enough cues or triangles for every table. The two cues that we were able to find were hella crooked. 

The bar had $8/domestic and $10/import pitchers. The waitress was nice and comes by to check on if you need more drinks quite often."
Negative	Great big place and I could see coming here if you have a big party and forgot to make reservations somewhere. The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't consider it authentic. Also, we had to send some of our plates back because some where really hot while the others were freezing cold. My advice: get liquored up while waiting for your food.
Negative	"Terrible service! NEVER COMING BACK!

My coworkers and I were having a busy day at work so we decided to call in ahead of time to place a pre-order to avoid the lunch rush wait. When we got there, the Manager was reluctant to provide us 3 separate bills because he said I didn't explicitly told the staff it was 3 separate orders which I DID. All our burrito orders were for small size but they charged one of us large cause the Manager said that was what the staff was told by me. Well, I'm pretty sure I didn't ask for a large burrito order but the Manager didn't even proceed to apologize or say there might be a miscommunication and still charged my coworker for a large burrito. He just kept mumbling ""there is so many errors in this order"". YES INDEED. Yet, he didn't do anything to rectify the situation! 

After we paid, we waited another 20 minutes before we got our food. Even the people that ordered on the spot after us in line got their food and left before we got our food.  

Overall, I am very disappointed as I enjoy their food but honestly, this location has the worst people working there. 

PLACED THE WRONG ORDER, LACK CUSTOMER SERVICE, LONG WAIT FOR A PRE-ORDERED MEAL."
Negative	I recently ordered some takeout. I was told on the phone that the food would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I showed up about 15-20 minutes after I ordered the food, and waited for ANOTHER 10-15 minutes before I got my food. The restaurant was almost empty. I tried the Super California sushi entree and got miso soup and Thai spring rolls with it. The Thai spring rolls were good. They were nice and crunchy and a decent size for the price. The miso soup had a LOT of seaweed in it... Like, way too much. I didn't know that miso soup was even supposed to have seaweed in it. The Super California sushi entree came with three variations of the California roll: normal, spicy, and crunchy. It honestly tasted like buffet sushi, but it wasn't inedible. The rice-to-sushi filling ratio was way off; the sushi rolls barely had any rice surrounding them. The crunchy California roll was easily the best of the three. It had the most flavor. Overall, not terrible, but I'll go somewhere else for sushi next time.
Negative	"First of all, when we went to enter the mall, the entrance was encrusted with bird poop everywhere. Even on the door & door handles. Yuck! Not a good impression when entering a shopping area. 

Anyway, I haven't been here in years. It hasn't really changed except it's not as clean as it used to be when it was new. We went on a weekday so parking wasn't too bad. But we only went to a few stores here, looking for semi-precious crystals."
Negative	"How the hell do you run out of donuts on National Donut Day? I'm from California and was so excited to finally get to try Dunkin' Donuts. We got there, we started to order and were told ""It's National Donut Day, Hun. So we are out of a lot of donuts."" Duh! Why do you think we came here today? It's only 10am. Next National Donut Day, I think this location should probably over order so you don't crush people's dreams."
Negative	"Not the best burgers, way too squishy and soft. Theres alot of vegetarian options but nothing super flavourful and good. I probably won't come back.

They have a couple of locations, in Niagara and Toronto. Prices are high too, almost 12$ for a combo."
Negative	The price is overly expensive for a fast food joint.  A burger, fries and drink will run you about $15. I found the fries to be bland and burned.  The burger was also bland even though I got a bacon double cheeseburger. It also takes a while to make it so if you're in a rush it's not the best place to go.
Negative	"I saw one of the many Drs at Urology Specialists and I was not impressed.  The waiting room was small and dirty looking. It looks like it hasn't been updated in 30 years! The doctor was curt and kept asking me the same question over and over. With no solution. Almost like he didn't believe me.
I was guided to checkout where the girl there gave me an appointment for a procedure that he didn't even discuss with me! I won't go back."
Negative	"Went in for a spray tan and I did not realize that I would be coming out with streaks everywhere. There was so much tanner applied to my body that I had to clean out my shower after just rinsing off! I have lines on my knuckles, and my hands look like I am an oompa loompa. Also, there was no clean mat for me to stand on, nor any lotion applied to my palms of bottoms of my feet in order to repel the tanner from those areas, so the bottoms of my feet had to be pumiced in order to not make them look like I stepped into a puddle of  mud...
I will not return here, and definitely think that going here for a spray tan his is a waste of money!"
Negative	"My wife and I went in to purchase a 2015 Jetta TDI.  The ""internet sales price"" was $11,999.  We offered $11k cash, plus tax, tags & license.  They came back with $2800 of ""dealer add-ons""; nitrogen tires (hey people, there's 78% nitrogen in the air we breath), window tint, and other hoopla to the tune of $16,977.  
My advice... just walk away.   There are so many other dealers who are willing to make HONEST offers and not try to swindle you. 
Essentially we should have walked out of that dealership $13,250 out the door."
Negative	"Tired this place out over the weekend.  Overall impression was the food was bland and flavorless.  You literally could mix one dish with the next and it all tasted the same.  I actually had to use salt to get any flavor, and that's never a good sign when you have to do that with Chinese food.  My biggest complaint would be with the Egg Foo Young.  I realize it's not a traditional Chinese dish, and only something indigenous to American-Chinese Cuisine; nevertheless, I grew up with Egg Foo Young and I'm tired of so many places doing it wrong!  If you're a fan of this tasty dish, then you'll know what I'm talking about.   This is one of those places that covers all the ingredients on the top of the egg patties, which is the lazy, wrong way to make it.  Good Egg Foo Young comes with the ingredients INSIDE the patty, then a light brown gravy over the top.  These guys obviously use a prepackaged egg patty - tasted like it had been frozen - then pour ingredients over the top with a dark, sweet gravy (wrong gravy type, too). 

Needless to say, I'm probably never going to visit this place again; unless it's the last place on earth and I'm literally starving."
Negative	"I haven't even begun to do business with this company, however they do not do business well on the phone. Trying to speak with the two people managing a property my husband and I were interested in here in Henderson was a nightmare. We made phone calls that we're either not returned or we were hung up on while waiting for them to ""find information"". They never told us when we could see the property, only kept giving us the credit speech ( what they look for, bad credit blah blah) and we have none of these issues, we just want to look at the house FIRST. I'm not buying pants before I do a credit check or look at them, same with the place I live. Also, he mentioned that the house is in Henderson (no kidding, we said we drove by it) and he's in the North West and it was a far drive. Obviously, you don't want to show this house, probably any house for that matter. Thanks so much for not helping."
Negative	"It's very upsetting that my first yelp review is a negative one. From the moment I stepped into this club, i felt unwelcome. I joined my friend in the bathroom where I was telling her that I planned on leaving because I had a long day the next day. With 2 minutes, an employee walked i and told us to take out conversation out of the bathroom. we just wanted a quiet place to discuss our situation, and we are kicked out. Then, I decided to stick it out and hang out with my friend and her boyfriend for one more hour before  bed since I rarely see them. I decided to sit at the bar while they danced. The bartender who told me I ""don't look 'fine'"" didn't care to know that I woke up at 4 am that morning, aka 24 hours prior to me sitting st the bar. I will never return to Tilden due to its terrible, unwelcoming staff. I'm allowed to enjoy time with my friends without participating in drinking or dancing without being questions about how sober I am. If you business cannot accept that some people want to be there and not drink because they've had a long day, there's a big problem."
Negative	"I was on hold for ten minutes, then they hung up on me. I was transferred 6 times and each time I was told ""hold on one sec"" then moved to the next person. No help whatsoever"
Negative	"Went here about a week ago.
I decided to get take out and ordered a chicken parm with a side salad and spaghetti.
When I called in the order they told me about 40 minutes minimum.
I went around and did some errands and then came back about 20-25 minutes after ordering.
I went in and the lady behind the counter was nice and was friendly.
The system for take out is not good at all.
I walked in and the lady behind the counter had to get another person then that person came out and took my credit card.
They took credit card and disappeared into back and then came out with food and receipt.
The process from the time I walked in to the time I walked out was at least 10 minutes.
The food was already ready when I came in so it sat there getting cold while they where getting the payment thru.
They told me at least 40 minutes it was less than 25 if I would of come at the 40 minute mark it would of sat for 15 minutes getting ice cold and then the 10 minute ride home as well.
Now for the food, I have too say the only good part of the meal was the salad.
The chicken part was not good and I did not like the taste of it also it was ice cold besides.
The spaghetti was cold and the sauce was not that good as well.
I do not think I would ever go there for take out again as the system for take out needs a lot to be desired as well as they do not know how to estimate food prep time.
I also noticed many negative reviews so I probably would not go back ever again.
I do not recommend Bravo for take out at all."
Negative	This is the WORST place ever. We called in an order and the girl taking our order was getting yelled at by the manager and was extremely rude to her and to us and told us we were taking too much of his time. Ummmm what happened to good customer service!!! Oh and it gets worse we go to pick up the food the manager is yelling at us from the back telling us we better not ever place a large order again. The girl working there walks out crying because the manager is yelling at her. If this is how you run your business get out of the industry. The worst service I have LITERALLY EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE. I Will NEVER EVER EVER come back here and if you're smart you'll stay away as well.
Negative	The reason I'm rating this low is cause it's pricey and they don't have a good selection in drinks I ate a Bbq pulled pork sandwich it was hella sweet and I think I should Of just got a Burger maybe. I was dissappointed. Probably won't come and eat here anymore it's too overated. Sorry not sorry.
Negative	"The two stars are just for service and ambiance, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the view of Las Vegas is beautiful, the food lacks in taste and quality though.  I had high hopes when we pulled in to meet another couple for dinner as the parking lot was full.  The food is on the mild side which cater to milder palettes.  My friend ordered the marinated pork chops, expecting 3 succulent chops only to find 3 thin slices of pork chops, which looked as if a pork chop was sliced into three.  Her fiance ordered the green chili burrito combo asking for just beans, cheese, rice, and sauce since he is a vegetarian, but they added pork into it.  My bf ordered a cobb salad and enchilada a la carte and did not enjoy his meal.  I ordered the Carnitas Fajitas and did not enjoy the taste.  It did not taste fresh and it lacked flavor...tasted like it was never marinated and came out of a slow cooker.  I actually took it back to the hotel room and doused it with the salsa I had leftover from the catering truck we purchased our breakfast from earlier, which was much cheaper and had more flavor.  Since some other reviewers raved about the ""delicious and different corn tortillas"", I ordered those with my meal to find stale corn tortillas that were most likely store bought, not homemade at all.  While I was packing my takeout container, they staff quickly took the tortillas...maybe to reuse since mine tasted old and stale?  As far as the salsa and beans served with chips prior to ordering the meal, the chips were cold, salsa was very bland, beans were nothing remarkable.  The fideo soup actually did have good flavor, but lacked substance.  The atmosphere was also very loud with music, so it is not a place to gather for people who are trying to catch up.  They were very busy so I am sure they will not miss our business.  I have had much better Mexican food in other restaurants and taco shops/stands."
Negative	I go to this place maybe once every two years?  It's because they have jjambong and jjajangmyun which not many places have in AZ...sadly I have to live with the mediocre food when I have the cravings for those two dishes which are Korean style Chinese food.  Their service is not too good either.  Waitresses are ok, but the owner lady is not too friendly.  She brings out the to-go food, puts it on the table, says a couple of words as to what it is, and doesn't even say thank you.  If the food's bad, at least they should be nice to you, but no.  Not at this place.  Sigh~
Negative	This was a Terrible experience. I went there today and there was no other customers there. I walked in and there was not one worker in sight. The two teen girls where gossiping in the back of something. After they finally realized we were there we order a few juices and they took 30 minutes to make 4 drinks. My daughter ordered a simple melon drink and they didn't even had the right ingredients to make it. They said the owner never brought in the order from two days ago!!! Then they gave me my smoothie and it was ridiculously thick, you would they they were blending straight up ice! There was oreos just laying on the ground everywhere. I brought it to the worker and just ignored me. I would never come here again.
Negative	Every time that I have attempted to order here I have been told that they are out of chicken breasts for the day! Are you kidding me? Close this place down!
Negative	Bullshit ass club, won't let a single female in, and wants to charge a local girl $50. Trippin. I like girls, I spend money on girls, I don't need a chaperone.
Negative	Shady business practices!  I changed addresses for my service. The customer service agent said he could give a standard tv package with STARZ for the same price I was already paying. I insisted I did not want to pay anything extra. He assured me I would not.  Troy from billing flat out LIED TO Me!!!!  When I got my bill it was $20.00 more a month. When I canceled the service Cox wanted me to return the box to them!
Negative	Great Wall has some decent food here. The egg rolls were very good. However the pepper beef was a little overboard on the black pepper but was still good I guess you could mix your steam rice in it to offset the excessive pepper. The second time we got an order to go they gave us shrimp low mein instead of chicken and the egg rolls were burnt to a crisp so I'm not sure if I want to punish myself trying it a third time.
Negative	"The place itself looks great; cool decor, ambient lighting, friendly service. No complaints there. 

I gave this place two stars because I wasn't impressed/attracted to anything on their menu. We finally ordered the squash fritti which was...flavourless and undercooked, and the grilled halloumi which was just so garlicky. Both were hugely overpriced. 

I could maybe come here again for a drink but there's better places around this area in my opinion."
Negative	Very disappointed with my last visit to this dispensary yesterday, I had ordered my medication online then proceeded down to the dispensary, I went through their check in and Verification that my medication was being filled and and ready for pick by me, then I  waited nearly 20 minutes in a very crowded waiting aera(standing room 0nly) to get to the medication pick up window, just to be told that they were out of my medication, this is the second time this is happened to me at this dispensary. I am very disappointed in this dispensary and doubt that I will ever return.
Negative	"My wife convinced me to give them another shot.. well i did nd i came in fr a maintenance cleaning..
They did not want to do it cause they wanted me to go-through their treatments first before a maintenance cleaning.. 
Not to mention the place was dirty which i think its not suitable fr a dentistry..
I suggest algodones i had a root canal done the same day and i had little to no pain.."
Negative	"Worst service I have had in a long time.  Here is the timeline of our eating experience.

Reservation 7:00
Restaurant pushed to 7:15 (no problem)
Seated 7:55
Drink orders 8:10
My beverage arrives 8:25 (pretty thirsty)
Food arrived for most of our party 9:00
One party members food 9:35 (apology but no compensation)
Bread and butter arrives 9:45 (new to me)

Again, service was terrible.  This is unfortunate because the food once it finally came was good my calzone was big enough for 2 and was pretty tasty.  If you can overlook terrible service, the food was good."
Negative	ive come here twice before & have been happy with the outcome of my nails. Today i went in & i believe the woman was new, she was older, short hair with bangs & glasses. I asked her 3 times to make my nails thinner as i noticed they were bulky, she would say ok & proceed to ignore my request. when it was time to wash my hands i asked if she was gonna make them thinner after she said i asked for squared nails... which i did but she clearly didn't understand. she proceeded to add polish & left it very sloppy i mentioned this & she said it looked like that cause of the color, which makes no sense. when i insisted to have my nails redone she got real hissy. Bad service, if you come here make sure you go with someone who knows what they're doing
Negative	Screw this place. Find out whoever are the owners were of the company and never do business with them. They shut down unexpectedly without telling anyone. My friend hasn't even received their down payment back. Bunch of heartless scumbags
Negative	"They do have a very good selection of eyeglasses at this shop and I have no issue with the shop or the folks who work there. However, if you see their optometrist, Doctor Helmick, he's independent.  Their ""office policy"" is that they will not fax prescriptions - to anyone - you or a place where you might order contact lenses.  Thus, you've got to travel to pick the prescription up or order through them, pay for shipping and then travel to pick them up, as they will not have them shipped to your home.  I was not given my prescriptions at the time of my visits because he wanted me to try some lenses before ""finalizing"" the prescription.  I simply want to order my contact lenses so I can see and it just shouldn't be this difficult after I've seen the doctor and paid for my appointment."
Negative	The bread from the bread and preserves was like day old supermarket ciabata and the cider (the server gushed over it when we ordered) was unpalatably sweet (the server said he actually didnt like it at the end)  the ploughmans dinner was nice, but again with a side of stale bread.  Ive been vegan fot 13 years, and while i really enjoyed some of the mushroomy fermented flavours, a non vegan would likely find them challenging.  The music was loud and confusing too.
Negative	"Ordered the #52 beef satay to find a hair wrapped around a slice of beef.

I told the waiter, he looked shocked and cursed. Took the bowl away without any apologies.

Came back with new beef in the bowl...I asked him if they also changed the soup. Waiter rudely told me ya and walked away. Heard him curse again as his back was turned.

Although we work hard to avoid it, I understand hair can get in food when cooking. Restaurant work is hard but showing courtesy and respect  is actually quite easy with reasonable customers. The issue is with the waiter's entitled attitude (buzzed sides, hair slicked back, short, stocky...unpleasant smile).

To other Yelpers I'd say Golden Bell is better in taste and service, up to you.

Update: Owner was understanding and waived my meal. The waiter was still smiling as I voiced my complaint, seems like he's a slow learner. 

Grateful the owner was professional in the end but we all go to restaurants to eat in comfort and avoid any grief. For the restaurant's sake and the career prospects of the genius waiter, please teach him some manners."
Negative	I checked it out looking for a washer and dryer. I was checking the price of best buy,home depot etc on my phone and there was the same price or cheaper. On top of that would have had to pay for the transport too...hmmm and the furniture wasn t as cheap either..idk why is called a clearance place!
Negative	Pretty sad. Showed up 20 min before closing and planned on getting the food to go. Good thing because they gave us 0 say in the matter. Nachos had movie theatre style cheese on them and a spoon full of retried beans. Terrible. All the carne was burnt (3 vampiros, 4 Street tacos), the burrito was cold and stuffed with sour cream and refried beans. When we could find a piece of carne it was burnt. Pretty bad experience and kind of upset I blew $22 here especially after seeing the 4.5 star total.
Negative	"Three strikes and you should be out. 

We visited a couple of years ago when it opened and service was horrible. They even forgot to serve our appetizers. 

Fast forward and a second visit was ok. 

Last week, well it was almost funny. At the outset the waiter told us  that there were no clams so dishes with clams didn't have any. My guest enquired about the croquettes - there were none left. I ordered the lobster bisque - there was none left. My friend had a pasta dish and it arrived with cheese on top. The restaurant was happy to take it away as my guest doesn't eat cheese but, they had run out of the pasta or the sauce or.... They offered no complimentary dessert, something to acknowledge that they really let us down.. They had no one coming around to see if dinner was ok. Real disappointment. Not sure why people return."
Negative	"My experience at Vue 412 was pretty hilarious actually. I went for dinner with my 5 girlfriends. We tried to order a bottle of wine, but every time we chose a wine the waiter would come back to our table and tell us they were out. Literally happened three times. Four of us ordered salads (which are 8 bucks each al la cart) and they didn't come until AFTER our entrees were served. I swear 4 employees kept apologizing about how late the salads were, which is nice, but damn just go get my salad!!! Finally the meals came and everyone really liked their food, but the portions were SO small. Not one of us had anything left over and some of us were still hungry! The staff kept apologizing over and over to the point where it became funny. On a positive note, they took the salads off the bill and even gave us some free deserts! It's a shame that I will never return, because all the food was really good!!
Vue 412, seriously... get it together!!!"
Negative	50 minutes is too long to wait for food. And then they brought out meals one at a time, about 3-5 minutes apart. What restaurant brings one meal at a time??? We were obviously not happy, but no visit from a manager. Instead they gave us $7 of our bill. They were happy when we got there, but it was one of my worst dining experiences. There are so many options in Arcadia, so skip this one. I was excited for the re-opening, but will go elsewhere.
Negative	"Food is ok, my complaint about this location is the kitchen is super slow.  Work really close by here, so if I want this type of food for lunch. This is the place.

Every time I order congee take-out, I end up waiting 10 to 15 minutes even if I call 15, 20 minutes ahead of time knowing that they are slow..

Don't have this problem when I go to the Midland and Finch location."
Negative	"Horrible store. 
smaller than the average Winners stores. Everything is a mess here. Almost always the shoes,bathing suites are misplaced. 

staff are SO RUDE!

the only thing I can possibly say good about this place is - around the cash line up area, they ALWAYS have cheap makeup wipes in stock for less than $4.00, an impressive collection of decadent chocolates and headphones for less than $10.00 - this is a steal in comparison to any other Winners. 

xoxo
M."
Negative	"FYI: Their pizza ""patio"" is NOT dog or even kid friendly. After we sat down outside and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back out to tell us that the dogs were only allowed to be tied up on the outside of the patio. She also added that kids weren't allowed on the patio either. There were no signs saying any of these rules posted inside or outside at the patio. If you're looking for a nice outdoor patio to bring your kids or furry friend and enjoy a nice drink or meal...this isn't the place."
Negative	"Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-

I and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the ""PANEER/cheese"". They can substitute it for ""MALAI KOFTA"". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / ""PANEER"" entree. On the other hand the ""MALAI KOFTA"" was just ""POTATO"" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. 

This is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER."
Negative	I've done my nails at multiple places but I hate to say that this place is the worse one I've gone to. The lady unevenly coated my nails. A few hours after I got them done, my nail chipped off because she filed that nail thin. 3 days later and I'm disappointed again because the gel chipped off another nail! I have never ever had these experiences from other nail salons. Im not one to wrote bad reviews, but I am just so disappointed
Negative	Unless you are just interested in AYCE and all U can drink Sapporo or Sake  ($6 extra bucks) keep driving down the road) This is it quality sushi. Rolls are skimpy and LOTS of rice. They give a disclaimer that Sushi means vinegar rice. Whatever...waaay too many places to choose from in LV to waste your money here.
Negative	"Completely unresponsive to tenants. I have messages then several times regarding property issues, they simply ignore them.

They are so internally disorganized that they don't even know who lives property! They have asked me for the same information 3 times. 

They only contact you when they want something.  They have allowed illegal parking in our complex since they took over the property a year and half ago. Even though, the rules state ""you cannot park in the driveways"". They have not kept the paint and garages uniform. They have pulled dead bushes and trees and Bebe replanted. Looks like a Rock garden in some areas of property. 

The do not pick up the property. I step over dog poop and the other day, a used condom in the only grass area. 

Time to contact the State for reprieve! Do not hire them to manage your property! Please"
Negative	"I'm sorry but this is terrible. I am famished so will eat about anything. I am breaking my fast from giving blood. 

Ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, white rye toast (extra). 
Coffee is watery slightly burnt. Eggs rubbery but edible with ketchup. Sausage is a link of lava over cooked with a slightly rancid aftertaste. Actually spit it out. Home fries are cooked in sausage fat so have residual disgusting aftertaste. 
Server is friendly. 
Good place to sit in front of the window and people watch."
Negative	Food was really bad... I can't see how people love this place.. I brought 11 people to come try,it was our first time.. The server Shawn was good but said cook sucks.. just like the food... never will go back..
Negative	"It's always a good sign when you see Mexicans eating at a Mexican restaurant. Or at least we thought. From the outside it doesn't look very promising, but it's rather roomy inside and very colorful and lively. The servers are nice, lacking some attention to detail, but you can't have it all.

The food was pretty basic, nothing spectacular or worthy of a second visit. The Horchata was watered down and they don't give you chips, which was very strange. 

The prices were fair but so was the food, I won't return."
Negative	"I just came back from my 5th Vegas trip...stayed at the Cal for the 2nd time. I work in the hospitality indsutry myself so I tend to watch employees' attitude. I was so surprised!

1) When I called before to confirm my room, both the operator and front desk were not very pleasant.

2) Bellman were watching a basketball game on TV at their desk while working!

3) Another time when I approached the bell desk to ask a question, he looked so bored, had his head on the desk while playing with his cell phone.

4) My friend was using a cell phone in a ""no cell phone area,"" NOT SEEING THE SIGN. A simple, ""Please refrain from using your phone"" would have ended it, but even after my friend apologized and hung up the phone, the security went on to turn the sign towards him, and told him something like, ""We all went to college, now, can't you read?"" How rude! What the heck was his problem? I couldn't believe the silly things that was coming out of his mouth. My friend made a complaint to the manager but I doubt anything will be done.

Being in Vegas, maybe these things are minor to most people, but to me, I think their slogan of, ""Aloha spoken here"" should not be used.

I will not stay here again.

Oh, the rooms are nice!"
Negative	"Pleck.. I should have known driving by with the midteen sign spinner dressed in a bacon costume that this was going to an event I would regret. 

The atmosphere is tolerable, nothing glamours. The servers are nice but not overly lustrous and the food is boring at best.. Yes, I did indeed regret some of my choices today. 

I ordered the omelette at the servers recommendations, hint #1 should have been his vague, eye rolling selection over the eggs Benedict. Next time I'll follow my gut. I was informed that all their items are ""large"", what our definitions are might be a bit different from each other. ""Large"" would be gross oversell, average would be a more accurate representation. Bacon, tomato and avocado omelette it is, the crossfit games were on, I felt powerful and motivated; hold the cheese please. What arrived was a sad disappointment and left me pondering my own pantry and my last minute Rachel Ray talents. A thin eggy shell of a bacon tomato mash was presented to me covered with an avocado slice, luckily no cheese.. Good news is that I cut my calories significantly by not consuming ALL of the bacon in my omelette, sad news is that I would have been better off to order scrambled eggs, a side of soggy bacon and a tomato garnish accompanied by carelessly cut warmed unseasoned potatoes instead. 

Where is the effort and attention to details my friends? My half hearted last minute attempt at imagining my breakfast was better than what I just ate. 

I'm so underwhelmed. 

Sadly I saw quite a few other menu items walk by (with my server who when time to leave was in no hurry to turn his table and accommodate the newly arriving patrons standing at the door) that did appear to be quite intriguing,  I was jus not fortunate enough to order then myself. 

I can't say I'll be back, the bacon costume tricked me once but I won't be had a second time now knowing better."
Negative	"The service at this establishment is terrible. My mom and I went here earlier today, and there were 3 greeters who just sat there chit-chatting. Keep in mind there was not a line nor was it busy. They didn't even bother to look at us and they weren't professional. I had to literally say loudly, WE NEED A BOOTH NOT A BAR TABLE. Our server was slow and awkward. When we asked for our ticket and dessert it took the server 20 minutes and we didn't even get our dessert for which we were charged for. We wanted to leave and so we went up to register and asked another employee to ring us out. She was the most rude person in that place. She told us: ""Well, your server has to take care of that"" and they left us dangling there for 10 minutes. The woman at the register would not help us but kept adding her 2 cents in. They did remove the charge for dessert we did not get, and the manager didn't even bother to see us. This is by far one of most terrible places I have been to and I will not come back.  So, my rate for this Red Robin is 2 out of 10."
Negative	"The food was amazing, don't get me wrong, but your employees need a lot of work. I ordered my sandwich and then went to go order my soup. A nice boy then asked me what soup I wanted and if I wanted any mix ins. Then suddenly this employee, K.D was on her nametag, barged in and yelled at the boy ""what are you doing here? You're not trained to do soups."" The poor kid just nervously told her that he was trying to help and K.D literally flicked her hand and shooed him away and said ""go away and stay at your little salad station."" WOW. Talk about rude! I work in a restaurant and it seems that your employees really need to work on teamwork. She could have easily helped him and guided him, but she instead chose to be so rude to the poor kid. He was just trying to help!"
Negative	"Let's be honest; slapping the word ""gourmet"" on something doesn't make it any better than it actually is. GBC offers over-priced run of the mill burgers with no frills simplistic branding (which I dig). I mean, the burgers are decent but I've had better. On the plus side, their fries and onion rings are money in the bank!

Also, seating is quiet limited so consider yourself lucky if you get a spot during lunch hour. Eating on a Cabbagetown curbside isn't usually that fun. 

In the end, it's a viable burger option if your in the neighbor but nothing to write home about. Seth Godin was right, marketers are liars because there's nothing gourmet about GBC."
Negative	God for bid you order the food online for pick up, you get there and all of a sudden you owe them something else. The food was OK the rice was really really dry. I mean if you're starving to death it's doable but if you're not then definitely order food somewhere else.
Negative	"Tried cancelling my flight, because I found a cheaper price for the same flight. Was put on hold for 30+ minutes, and up until now, I'm still on hold. The website and my confirmation email says that I can cancel my flight for free within 24 hours of booking, and their hotline is 24 hours. And yet, I'm still waiting for someone to pick up their phone.

Kayak, you should not even redirect your customer to this website AT ALL.

UPDATE: So someone picked up the call after 40+ mins, and then the person on the other line says that I can't cancel my booking (even though it's only been 1 hour), and she needs to check with her supervisor. So I was put on another wait of like 20+ mins? And still the answer was no, I can't cancel it. She said, ""Yes the cancellation is free, but we won't refund the ticket"", I was like, seriously??? Then what does that mean it is ""Free cancellation within 24 hours"" ??? I can just not show up for my flight and it'll still be free cancellation by her term.

In the end I'm going to dispute the charge through my credit card. This is borderline scam folks. Again, Kayak, do yourself a favor and remove this vendor from your site."
Negative	The sides are better than the meats. The service was 50/50. Our server was nice, he seemed overworked if anything. He was taking care of several tables and basically bar tending. The guys who come by to slice meat on your plate or a little rude and pay little attention. There really is no point asking for rare or even medium rare as this establishment seems to only believe in overcooked or burnt and dry. At least there wasn't a wait and we had 8 people with no reservations on a Saturday morning. DO NOT TRY THEIR SANGRIA. It's terrible unless you're into Robitussin on ice. We went with the mimosas, they ran out of Shocktop. With the mimosas it seemed like 90/10 ratio on orange juice/champagne. I can't get over how overyly dry everything was.... no flavor... just dry as hell. Even their salmon! The only thing my party really ate was their shrimp. Clams were practically dehydrated. I used a Groupon and still left soooo dissatisfied. We should have just went to Taco Bell Cantina, lol. Also... who charges for water? Sure, the water is held in a frosty bottle... but you aren't able to take the water bottle home. They  just fill up the water bottle and then charge people $2  per person whether you even want water or not. PASSSSSS.
Negative	I recommend to anyone considering Life Time Fitness to first take a look at their BBB rating as well as ripoffreport.com. I am profoundly disturbed and dissapointed by Life Time's business practices and customer service. Just as all the reviews state, when they are not using car salesman style pitches for overpriced services they are nickel and diming you on the membership dues. I put my account on hold in May 2016 due to financial hardship. They told me I needed to pay $10 a month for absolutely nothing other than having my membership paused. Then they reinstated my membership that September unbeknownst to me. Apparently there was a clause in the contract that allowed them to resume sucking up my money after the specified date. Apparently they don't send you notifications in the mail, just an email that will get lost in your spam folder. So I spent over $350 since then for absolutely no reason as I to this day have not stepped into a Lifetime Fitness since that May. I called the branch and they could not be less interested in what their customers have to say. They simply said I needed to be present in person to change or cancel my membership, and that I'd need to pay for yet ANOTHER MONTH before they could stop charging me. The corporate office was just as hard to deal with, absolutely no desire to help work through issues with their loyal customers. They will just remind you of whatever contract you signed and why they are legally allowed to do the things to you they do, and they will not be friendly about it. This company has absolutely no loyalty towards its customers. The funny thing is, I was looking to resume my membership around this time, I was even going to add my girlfriend to the plan who is working off some baby weight. I didn't even want my money back, I was happy with a prorating of the unused months toward future membership dues. No sympathy, no loyalty, only cash money talks at this place and they don't care how many customers they estrange, just look at the other reviews. One would expect exceptional customer service when paying twice as much as the usual premium, however Life Time utterly fails at this. It's really sad because it IS a nice gym, but be prepared for the bitter taste they will leave in your mouth when it comes to their backhanded business practices.
Negative	"I was given the wrong items.  When they finished making my smoothie and sandwich they didnt even say anything.  They just left it on the counter.  They didn't smile.  I had to go up there and ask if this was a Chipotle chicken wrap.  The girl had no clue.  I then asked another guy twice.  He said um.  Then he said yes.  

Well, it wasnt.

Employees don't smile.  My Muscle Builder smoothie was without protein.  

1 star."
Negative	"I had a 5-star rating for this place back in November, but unfortunately what I've experienced lately from them is just awful. I have called to place orders over the phone and on 2 different occasions they have been OUT of what I was asking for. Mind you, both of these orders were placed within minutes of opening. You don't have eggs at 8am for a breakfast wrap? Seems odd. Also, one time I placed an order over the phone for the peanut butter protein smoothie...when I went to pick it up, the very rude girl told me they were out of the protein they usually use so it was just the peanut butter, banana and almond milk. WAIT, I order this FOR THE PROTEIN and now it is no longer a protein smoothie and you are still going to charge me full price? I left pretty agitated and told her to keep the ""protein"" smoothie. I definitely give credit where credit is due, and I was ordering food from here multiple times a week at one point, but I'm definitely giving up. The food is good, BUT they are terribly inconsistent and unreliable. Sad to take this place out of my food rotations, but I have high expectations, especially when prices are high."
Negative	Aimee the server is extremely rude, and needs some training on her serving. My friend asked a simple question and she responded with attitude while rolling her eyes. Get a new job
Negative	"Bad Food Prep

This evening my friend purchased a chicken burrito to go. When she got home it fell apart and had to unwrap and rewrap it to eat it. So I took the liberty of calling the store to inform them of the situation. I explained that my friend had just purchased a burrito and it fell apart when she picked it up to take a bite. His response was ""okay,"" followed by silence. I told him she had to eat it with a fork (which defeats the whole purpose of ordering a burrito), to which he replied ""okay."" Then I asked if I can come back to get another one (on the house of course) and he said sure and asked when I'd like to come back. I responded ""next weekend."" He said ""okay, I'll be here."" Then I asked his name - he replied Alex. I asked if he was the manager - he replied yes. Huh? So the entire time I was speaking to the manager? Bottom line, the food was ill-prepared and the customer service provided by THE MANAGER was horrific. Thanks Alex, but my friend and I will not be returning. We're more than happy to spend our money at a competitor."
Negative	Long wait times. 30 min last 2 visits ..people coming in after my group received their food (some orders are same dish as mine). Turns out they forgot to plate mine. And not sure why. I was very polite, respectful. Waited in line and paid like everyone else. Then I saw the girls at the cashier point at me and laugh after I asked for my money back. Not professional. And definitely not impressed.
Negative	"We ventured into Margaritaville on a late Thursday afternoon on 4-24-14 during Happy Hour.  Decor was awesome! Not busy, should have been a sign for us.  My husband wanted to sit inside but near the outdoors.  We let the Hostess know but she seated clear on the other side in a corner!  This started my husband off on the wrong foot! 

We each ordered a drink.  I, the $5 House Margarita special which was not very good but considering the price.  I've tasted lots better. It came out in a regular standard glass!!  One would think eating at Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville it would be in a Margarita Glass for the theme and fun!!   I then gave my Margarita to my husband and I ordered the Fins to the Left. The color of it was pretty and the name was what I was paying for but the taste was just not there!  I wasted $7.50 on that drink!!

We ordered Lava Shrimp for our app. which was quit good, delicious in fact but it went down hill from there.  My husband said his Jimmy's Jammin' Jambalay
 was very  good BUT over priced for the amount he got, should have been around $14 or $15 instead of the $18 he was paying.  We had to wait to find someone to ask for Hot Sauce for his Gumbo as it got cold. Here comes paying for the name thing again!  I ordered the Blu Cheese Burger since the waitress said it was their most popular and ordered it MEDIUM.  Fries were good BUT my burger was DONE and DRY!!  Hardly any Blu Cheese on the burger!!   Worst hamburger I ever had and to think this is Jimmy Buffet Hamburger in Paradise?  I think NOT!!  I did not let the waitress know since it would be another 20-25 minute wait for another even though they were not busy.  I just went ahead and ate it.
 
We have been trying to get here for 3 years to eat since we live almost 1 hour from there and it was a major disappointment.  We should have gone back to Yardhouse where the drinks, food and service was so much better!  If we come back, it will be during Happy Hour and we will get several orders of the Lava Shrimp and only beer. Something basic.  Not wasting my money on a Margarita when they do not know how to make them in Margaritaville and served in a standard everyday glass. !!  Once again, we were only paying for the name!!"
Negative	"This is a long review but want to get it out. Do not use this company!!! I called my warranty company due to an issue I had with both my furnace and my AC. They referred me to this company on this past Tuesday. No one picked up immediately so I had to leave a VM. They called me back within 45 minutes. They were able to get a tech to my house the same afternoon which was nice. Three gentlemen showed up, 2 in uniform and 1 casually dressed in tshirt and jeans. I was quite surprised to see 3 come to my house to fix my issues but what ever it takes to fix the problem I really didn't care. I told them I needed both my furnace and my AC checked out. They tended to the furnace first since it was winter and that was my main issue. They told me it just needed a valve replaced and that was all. The one tech said they were all set and left. I realized after they left that they didn't mention the AC. So I called the company back and asked them about my AC and she said she will call the tech back. When he called back he said that he did an ""inspection"" and it looked fine and he said since it's winter I shouldn't have my AC on. Of course I knew that and felt his comment was irrelevant to the issue I had with it so pretty much he didn't really fix my AC issue. Anyways that same evening I went to my master bedroom and found my ceiling fan/light wasn't working. I called that evening and left a message figuring it was after hours already so I would get a callback the next day. No call all day Wednesday so I called on Thursday and spoke to a lady and gave her my complaint on my fan. She said she would have the tech call me. No call. I called back on Friday at 10am and spoke to another lady and said she would call the tech. She called me back and said the tech would stop by my house when he was in the area. She made it sound like he would be around that day. So by 3pm still no show so I called again and had to leave a VM. So it is now Saturday and they still have not called me back and so I called back and again, left a VM. This is poor customer service for one, they don't return calls and 2 they break something. I called my warranty company to give a complaint so we'll see if I get any luck with that. If you want something fixed and with good service look else where."
Negative	"I brought my dog here for an emergency visit after she nearly fainted at the Riverdale West park. She froze on the spot while playing with another dog, started panting frantically, and I could feel her heart rate lowering and her gums then went white (very bad sign for dogs). 

While they did see us in a somewhat timely manner, I'm not entirely satisfied with the visit. The vet was vague about what caused this to happen, which is understandable given no patient history or any testing, and suggested blood-work, though he didn't really think it was necessary. By this point they didn't seem to be entirely concerned as she started to regain colour and normal breathing. Since blood-work can be pricey, and he was not her regular vet, they suggested we take her home, give her honey since her heart rate was low, and let her rest and monitor her. We followed their instructions and she had an allergic reaction, which sent us right back to the clinic for shots. She was exhausted after all was said and done, and after a full meal, slept the rest of the day, and recovered normally over the next few days. 

I got her in to see her regular vet within a couple days, and he was completely shocked they had suggested honey as it is chock-full of pollen and allergens. He said under no circumstances would he ever suggest feeding a patient honey as it is too risky, and said he would only ever recommend something like syrup since it is high in sugar but has very few ingredients. He guessed that she had a hypoglycemic attack and prescribed a high calorie supplement that contains no allergens.

I'm on the fence about this one, I deliberated rating it 3 stars since they were time-efficient, asked a lot of questions, and weren't too pricey. However I cannot get past the fact that they recommended I give my dog something full of allergens. While it may seem like something minor, my dog is a 6.5lb. Chihuahua, an allergic reaction in a dog that size can escalate pretty quickly and had we lived any further from the clinic, it could have been much worse."
Negative	"My wife and I were looking for a breakfast spot before driving back to Columbus and the Urban Kitchen had a good website and diverse menu. It was shortly after 12pm and we were the only people in the restaurant, not a good sign for a new restaurant.  If we hadn't already paid for parking we would have left.

My wife really wanted French Toast and I was looking for lunch.  The menu said that the French Toast came with powdered sugar which my wife informed the waitress that she did not want.  I ordered the cheeseburger and fries.  It is worth noting that the waitress did not write anything down. About 20 minutes later our food came, my cheeseburger and a waffle. Yes, a waffle and not French Toast.  Since we were the only people in the restaurant when we ordered it's hard to believe that they got it wrong.  Also, the waffle that came out appeared to be of the frozen variety. We sent that back and waited another solid 15 minutes for the French Toast.  When the French Toast came out it was covered in an obscene amount of cinnamon, which the menu didn't list at all.  My wife did try to eat it but after a few bites she was done.

I went up to pay and told the waitress about the cinnamon and her response was that cinnamon was listed on the menu.  Since there was a menu right next to us she did pick it up to check and there was no mention of cinnamon.  There was no apology and no offer to take the French Toast off the bill.  

While I was paying the restaurant received a call about a takeout order that had issues.  Also, there was another couple that came in while we were there and I overheard a discussion where their order was also not right.  

To be fair, the fries that came with my cheeseburger were very good.  The cheeseburger did not seem seasoned at all.  In summary this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  Hopefully, they'll take this information and improve.  They've got a long way to go."
Negative	"This place is ALWAYS understaffed. This morning I called to make an appt, the girl told me 345 was available but they didn't save my card from last time and she couldn't hold the appointment without. Then she said ""hold on, let me check your account and see if it's there"" she comes back on the line and says ""ok, you're all set for 3:45"". I have a function tonight and time is tight. I showed up with wet hair to be told ""oh didn't you get my phone call?!""  Obviously not since I'm standing here with wet hair and no appt. i understand things happen like maybe she called, maybe not - I didn't get a message. She very rudely says "" well sorry, there's nothing we can do. Have a nice day!!!"" Are you kidding me??  Don't waste your time here."
Negative	So I told 3 of my friends about $10 tuesday..we usually go out to dinner together once a month. So we planned this about a month ago and the sisters I guess found a coupon for a free pizza (I have no idea what the coupon says). So we are seated and hand waitress coupon they order there cheese pizza I'm next and said $10 cheese and sausage you can't have that price with coupon ok I'll sit at another table cause your pizza isn't worth $20 waitress says you can't do that. Our other friend can't have red sauce of course they don't have white cheese pizza anyways it goes on  what my problem is , is that the waitress sees we are upset and doesn't say anything but negatively. A great waitress  (customer service) would of said oh this might work for you and this price would be better..nothing ..None of us will be back..
Negative	"Another burger place.  Don't get me wrong, I love hamburgers, but I don't need more temptation to eat another burger.  This is the third one within a mile, not including McDonlds and The Vine.

It was not easy getting into this place either if you're East bound on Elliot Rd.
I drove around that parking lot looking for a way on that doesn't currently exist.   :-p

I will tell you service was prompt and polite.  Menu appears to have some decent options.
My fail was to combine some toppings on the burger that just didn't blend well.  I don't understand.  Blue cheese, spinach, tomatoe, and onion is GREAT as a salad.  On top of a burger it was blech.  
Burger was well done, as in overcooked.  And greasy.
The egg bun is good.
French fries are alright.
Shake was tasty, but how often do you encounter a shake fail.  

Personally, I dont think we'll be back here very often."
Negative	"Ridiculous lines and ridiculous prices. Waiting 30+ minutes for coffee with 4 people on staff isn't what I expected. Management should add another barista so that one person doesn't do the drinks alone.

Should've gone to that chocolate store downstairs for coffee instead."
Negative	"Because this is kinda the ""place to be"" for Pitt students, I tried to remain pretty lenient with my expectations for the quality, but it is many kinds of awful. 
Food can be pretty good, can also be pretty bad. Same for the service. I'm not talking about busy Wednesday, Thursday, Friday nights - because I understand becoming impatient with the rowdy college crowd and being a human. I'm talking about like on a Tuesday at lunch time, the servers and bartenders will make sexual violence and anti-gay jokes in front of the customers so.... nope. 
Also the mixed drinks are watered down and taste terrible."
Negative	My orange juice came out warm,my eggs arrived cold and my server vanished after taking my order. Never was offered a refill on my coffee. I have been waiting 15 min for a check to arrive and my server has not stopped back. Someone else brought out my food, and no one has checked back! This is the worst service I have ever received here when the server was at the table she was rude and short with me. I do not recommend wasting your time or money, you'll get a cheaper meal and better quality food and service at Denny's.
Negative	We were in Scottsdale for a short vacation and.booked a reservation at this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. One hour before our scheduled reservation we received a phone call informing us that they were canceling our reservation due to the fact that it was raining and they could not accommodate people on their patio. I mentioned that we had never been asked if we wish to sit on the patio or not I was informed that they just arbitrarily assigned some of their patrons there. Is amazing to me they would choose to ruin half of their clients evening rather than figuring out how to make accommodations for inclement weather.
Negative	"Although I did state in my previous review that I would like to stay elsewhere on a future Vegas trip, I ended up booking the Luxor due to their affordable (cheap!) rates that I found on their website.  I wanted to make my trip as cost-friendly as possible, and so I reluctantly reserved a room for 3 nights during the week.

The GOOD:

1)  Check in process was for the most part efficient, as more check-in counters were opened up to accommodate the growing check-in line.  The female staff member who helped me was (though not overly friendly) polite and thorough for the most part. The entire check-in process lasted less than 5 minutes and she then gave me directions to the elevators for the West Tower.

NOTE:  The Luxor sent me an email shortly after I made my original reservation for possible room upgrades.  I had originally booked a room in the pyramid, but the email stated upgraded rooms may or may not be available and to check availability of said rooms upon check-in.  After reading the ""fine print"" carefully, I chose a potential upgrade to a Tower Deluxe room. There are other more pricier/larger rooms available as well, when you submit your upgrade request you can choose up to 3 upgrade room selections.   I'd like to say there is a ""catch"" but there is none as you keep your existing reservation at the original price if the upgrade room you chose is not vacant.  Our upgraded room was available in the West Tower, which was a much farther walk from the check-in desk than I had anticipated.

2)  Housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping the room tidy for the duration of our stay.  I appreciated their efforts in keeping our bathroom neat and clean especially.

3)  As with my past experiences at Luxor, the Valet staff remains friendly, quick, and efficient as they always have.  

4)  We ended up using the mobile function to check out.  Just text LCHECKOUT to 23300 and follow the prompts.  It was quick and easy!


The NOT SO GOOD:

1)  The shower drain drained quite SLOWLY for our entire stay.  This was slightly disturbing when we initially discovered it, and was very disappointing.

2)  The tv remotes should be replaced.  The buttons worked but not very well.

3)  The guest functions on the television need to be checked if they're working properly.  I attempted to check my balance and check out via the guest services on the tv but none of those functions worked....at all.   Another epic fail.

Bottom Line:  I'm not sure that even a cheap rate will convince me to book another reservation at Luxor in the future."
Negative	"I am at this casino right now and my boyfriend just picked up $50 on a blackjack table and the dealer had the nerve to say ""thanks for being generous"" when he didn't receive a tip. We were at the table for 5 mins TOPS. Such a classless comment. We cashed out immediately and took our money elsewhere!!!"
Negative	"Worst customer service ever. Wanted to try out a new spot around my area was definitely unimpressed. Went in with 3 other friends and ordered our food to go. When we got home and opened it up to eat it everything was wrong. One of ours was completely different from what he ordered and the other forgot his cobbler that he paid seperate for. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it didn't even have any chicken in it. We went back to get our orders fixed and came in to a waitress with an attitude who didnt feel the need to try to help out. After standing there for a second another customer in the store said his name was the same as my friends and come to find out the completely wrong order that went all the way back to our house and all of us ate because we were hungry in the first place they tried to give to him as if that was his fresh order. If we didn't say anything to him he would have taken it! After that we sat there for another 15 mins and when the food that she brought us out to replace sat behind her for a good five mins and she never brought it out. Not even any attempt to make up for their mistakes either with something for free our anything at all, just attitude. And apparently their manager ""doesn't work there."" All in all none of our food was good and if it was it wasn't by the time we got to it because we had to wait so long. Got a floppy waffle and some mediocre chicken AND missed the first quarter of the Packers game. Don't waste your time with this place."
Negative	"EVERY single time I come through here, they mess up my order. And I mean EVERY TIME... If it wasnt so close to where I live and convenient on nights where i dont feel like cooking or speding alot of money,  i'd drive to belle vernon instead of coming to this dump. 
My boyfriend always order a burger plain, with just cheese, and it never fails that they load it up with everything anyway, or even better, they realize they messed up, and then scrape all the condiments off, leaving a ketchup soaked bun that tastes like onions, rather than just tossing the bun lid and grabbing a new one. 
Tonight when we came here, my boyfriend returned his burger to the counter (as usual) and told the girl that he ordered plain. He politely showed her the ketchup soaked bun and she said ""ok no problem"" and went to the cook and showed him. The kid cooking grabbed the burger and screamed ""it is plain!"" Not realizing my boyfriend was standing at the counter and could hear every word. The cook started tearing the burger apart layer by layer, yelling that it was a plain sandwich, and he stuffed it back in the box and shoved it at the girl and said ""give it back to him"". The poor girl had no idea what to do, so she went and got the manager herself. In the meantime, my boyfriend tried to explain to the kid cooking that the bun was saturated and almost dripping with ketchup and the kid replied ""that's not my problem"". 
It took every ounce of patience and biting my tongue not to completely snap. Luckily the manager grabbed him right after she made my boyfriend a new burger and told him they had to have a talk. Hopefully for all future customers sake, he will be fired."
Negative	"Got the driving experience for my bf's bday. My boyfriend loved the Lamborghini driving experience! He said the trainer with him was awesome!  Service was great up until we wanted to purchase the ride along with the drifter. The latino sales lady in the cash register area said she doesn't want to add us yet cus it might be a wait and that she doesn't want to process refunds or something so she said to check back in 20 mins. (wtf? Ok?) then we were waiting at the couch area near the latino sales lady and I see people signin up for the drifting experience. Wtf? So I lined up cus I saw her put those walk ins before me and was obviously not happy. I don't understand what the fck we were waiting for in the first place?? She then told her colleague to put us in front of the walk in. Her colleague then transferred the message to this other chcik who seemed in charge of calling people up when it's their turn, the girl in charge said there's no way im putting them in front of the walk ins. The messenger, backing off, just said I don't know but she said just do it. Then the chick in charge said no and just ignored her. N we had to wait an extra 30 minutes and miss the shuttle back to the strip. Super awesome customer experience!  I blame the Latino chick at the cash register. Whythe f did she tell us not to sign up n wait 20 minutes to check back n sign other people up. What a bitch. If it weren't for this girl, I'd give this place a 5 star.

About transportation there, I cabbed there and it's about $55 (including tip) and u can catch the presidential shuttle back which is $20 / person!"
Negative	"I was wound up like a little girl all day waiting and waiting to go to our 8:20pm showing of Polar Express in 3D at the IMAX.  I had seen the movie when it came out and loved it.  I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Tom Hanks does.  I knew it was a great movie, but I was on pins and needles waiting to see it with my hubby.  It was his first time to see the magic of the movie or a one in 3D at an IMAX.

The magic was washed away as soon as I stepped into the holding area to the theatre.  It was a dreary, depressing, uncomfortable place to wait until the theatre doors were ready.  I saw that there was popcorn, MY FAVORITE PART OF A MOVIE, but it I wasn't hit with the scent of seduction when I walked in.  To me, that means old, cold popcorn.  Grrr.

After our tickets were taken, we made our way through the filthy hall to our seats.  Oh yeah- they are assigned.  What's up with that?  Luckily, there weren't many people so we sat where we wanted without a problem.  The seats were stained with God knows what, arm rests were broken, seats were broken.  It was disgusting.  I have been in multiple IMAX theaters in Florida and they have all been pristine!  Where, exactly, is my $15.00 going?

The sound is amazing, the screen is awesome and 3D is incredible.  That's the only thing they've got going for them.

After I left, I was thrilled with the movie but I felt like I needed to have a lice screening."
Negative	When a breakfast place is totally empty on a Sunday morning, it's not a good sign. Hubby and I were visiting Vegas last weekend and stopped by Panini Cafe for some breakfast. Menu looked promising. We ordered omelets, he the spinach and I the mushroom, and they were both horribly overcooked and lacking in general flavor. I'm not sure why, but they were served with a dish of sour cream. Strange. Looking for something to eat on the side, I saw baked potato on the menu, so I asked for one. They brought me a cut up boiled potato. Weird. I guess it was good I had the sour cream, for the potato... If you can't cook an egg and don't know what a baked potato is, don't run a restaurant.
Negative	"Never got lashes!

I'm sitting outside the salon now and she had to turn me away because she was double booked. 

This is the second time she's tried to reschedule with me. First time she had to leave town (a month ago). This time she said her boyfriend did her scheduling. Not sure what that means but ok. 

Nice girl but listen to the other reviews. She's not easy to schedule with. I wasted half of my day revolving around this appointment. 

Some people aren't the best with time management or honoring appointments and that is ok but please stop wasting people's time!"
Negative	"Brutopia has an interesting layout- that is, the way the tables are set out. it appears to be an older building so that might relate to the layout. There are 3 floors so there's a lot of space, however it was still difficult to find a table at first as it was busy.

There's a selection of house beers, some of which are seasonal. I opted for a raspberry house beer, which was just ok.

Service was really slow, it took a while for any service. Maybe it was just a really busy night, but this place is just ok, nothing exceptional."
Negative	"This review is not about the food, which was good.....our server on the other hand was mediocre at best,and should not be in the Restaurant business.
Wanting to take plates when we weren't finished, to then asking,
'Are you finished now!' two minutes later in a somewhat surly manner! 
When you are talking about how bad the service is during the meal it doesn't add up to having the best dining experience!"
Negative	The shop is nice and uniform with the way all the stations match. But my haircut wasnt great. The fade i asked for was okay. Not the best. I dont think the one that cut my hair knows how to line up properly because he messed my line up pretty bad. Like it wasnt even straight. Because he messed my line up, i will be looking for another barbershop to go to. It was the first or second barber on the left hand side if you were wondering. Goos luck to all future customers going here
Negative	NO STARS!!! honestly, worst establishment i have ever been too and they don't seem to even care. One person working with a long line... no tortillas, she said they haven't prepped the chicken salad yet (it's noon) -- i didn't even bother to order anything else with the fear that they wouldn't have it. After stating there wasn't any tortillas she proceeds to put one of the orders in a tortillas which was supposed to be a bowl. I let her know that it was supposed to be a bowl and not a tortilla considering you just told me you didn't have any tortillas. She rolls her eyes and chucks the wrap into the trash. Spare yourself.
Negative	I will never return to this chilis again!!! Valerie our waitress was by far the worst and I have never been so insulted in my life by anyone like her . I told her that she wasn't very attentive to our table and we needed the soup warmer the wings were under cooked and my chicken on my salad wasn't cooked good and her response was well your kids were screaming !!! Btw my daughter cried once because she dropped her crayon she's 1!! I guess chilis isn't family friendly !
Negative	This location is ALWAYS out of stock on items. It's disorganized, messy, and frankly...behind on the times. I love Target, but I'm really starting to get burnt out on this spot.
Negative	"I gave Pho Rancho Asian Cuisine a one star -- .5 star for service and .5 for taste. 

First, the service was terrible. The inside was fairly large and a big sign says, ""Please seat yourself"" as soon as you walk in. I went in and it took 5 minutes before anyone brought a menu to me. At that rate I expected water to be brought as well, but that took another 5 minutes. Keep in mind that there was only one more table with customers besides us. The server was not nice, didn't greet us when we arrived, and never checked on us. He took the order, gave us our food, and I had to go up to the counter to pay. Wow. 

Second, the food DID NOT make up for the terrible service even though the ratings were high on Yelp. I'm guessing the only reason the ratings were good was because Northside people HAS NEVER tried real vietnamese food from Chinatown or anywhere else in general. We order pho dac biet and there was NO FLAVOR. I feel like they just added beef powder with water and called it pho OR they watered down the real pho soup. Regardless, I was very disappointed. I couldn't even finish my meal. 

By the way, you cannot order smoothies, dessert drinks, or any drinks on the last page of the menu that includes milk. Because they ran out. 

Moral of the story. If you are craving vietnamese food, please go to Chinatown or somewhere else."
Negative	Ok I don't know how they have 5 out of 5 the service is very bad this is because the person taking the order forgot to put in 3 of the plates we ordered the person making the food is also the person who makes the drinks so he has to stop cooking come out and make a drink It took one hour and 15min to get our food and it came out 1 plate every 10min ( it was 7 of us ) so that was annoying the food was 3 out of 5
Negative	The sandwich had barely any filling, and the veggies/meat that were there were obviously old and wilting on a stale piece of bread. Quality and quantity weren't there. Definitely worst banh mi I've ever had.
Negative	"MEH! Not so yummy buffet. 

The wife and I ate there tonight and we were terribly disappointed with the quality of the food. Much of it was stale, lukewarm (the warming tables aren't NEARLY hot enough!) and I was totally put off by the dark and somewhat unfriendly atmosphere. 

I'll stay away from this place and spend my money elsewhere."
Negative	Do not use this property management company!!!  Renter's Warehouse is the worst to do business with...they do not respond to emails or calls.  They cancel meetings.  I even contacted the VP, and he never responded to me.  BEWARE!
Negative	"I feel this was disappointing. Nothing stood out to me in terms of food nor atmosphere. I actually found the live fish tank a bit creepy. I tried: dumplings, spring rolls, papaya beef salad, rare beef pho and caramelized fish (we were a group and shared). 

Dumplings were bland and only available fried with a peanut dip sauce (I prefer steamed dumplings with vinegar based sauce). The spring rolls were fresh but nothing special. Same for the salad. The pho was actually worst than what I usually get at average pho restaurants. I didn't like the broth much. Finally, the thing I was most excited and curious about : the fish. It wasn't bad, but it was sweet - and I wish it wasn't. I bet there are some hidden gems here but I haven't gotten any. Not bad, but really really standard/slightly sub par."
Negative	"Summary: Penn Ave Fish Co is a shit show as a business and at least some of their food can keep the people coming. Service is terribly slow and the servers are clueless. It looked like a madhouse. One of the owners (Harry or Henry??) kept flirting with me and it made me uncomfortable because he is definitely at least 45 and I'm 18 lol. It didn't help that I kept catching him looking at me while I was eating..


When I first went to Penn Ave Fish Co, I immediately thought, ""This place is a shit show."" There was a blatant disorganization between the kitchen and the front of the house. In fact, there was even miscommunication amongst the servers themselves. 

When I received some of my food (they forgot the sushi), my server had went to go retrieve one of the other servers because she ""didn't know which one it was."" It just seemed like the servers were relatively clueless and would only say what they thought you wanted to hear in this awful whiny baby voice. And does anyone think it's weird that all the servers are girls? I guess if making your servers show their  bare chests brings you business then so be it. The Hooters of Fish joints, let me tell you. 

The service was terribly slow but at least the food was kind of good. I got the Sanjaya Swordfish which was a little dry and bland but the sushi made up for it. I got a sexy señorita roll which I highly recommend. The yellowtail tasted fresh. I also had a side of pasta salad and it was too vinegary. Hardly finished the first bite. 

I had the chance to talk to one of the owners (Harry or Henry??) and he honestly made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. He came over to my table of three and it just felt like he was hovering over me too closely. At first, I thought it was just me and then my two brothers said it felt like he kept checking me out even after he left left the table. What a creep job! He even winked at me too when I left. 

Maybe I'll get take-out sometime but definitely not dining in ever again."
Negative	We purchased our countertops through Ikea, IN FEBRUARY, and unfortunately got stuck with Chivino. The man who came out to measure was so nice and really new what he was doing. However, they do not have the quartz we ordered in stock. We were told there would be a delivery truck on Thursday, but according to a different employee the truck wasn't scheduled to come until the following Monday. So either they lied or are not informed. They also said they can't guarantee that our stone will be in the next order. We paid for our counters in February!! They never answer their phone and they do not call you back when they say they will. NEVER use them. I am sitting here paying for a home I can't use and they don't seem to care at all.
Negative	DO NOT ever, EVER come to this particular location. Terrible service, staff doesn't seem to know what they're doing or how to do anything in a timely manner. Waited an extra 20 minutes after getting to the location at the exact time my order was supposed to be ready.
Negative	I've visited this location a few times and although I have had good customer service, the staff always seems very disorganized and the chicken is always overcooked and dry. 3 times and the same issues occur, which is enough for me not to visit this location again.
Negative	Worst cake I have ever ate , the owner said that all debit machines are broken ?! Seriously? This is just their techniqhe to pay less taxes !! She also said japanese have high standard so they have to throw a lot of craked cake ?! Thats why there is such a long line ? Thats not true . The cake i got is craked so are my friends! Taste is bad too . They just use hunger selling technique to fool average customers .
Negative	Awful Awful Awful .........unfortunately its only a mile from where I live and not another store closer. Never have shopping carts in the store whn u get there u mill around the parking lot to catch somebody rtn to there car and ask for the cart !! Went 5 times over 21/2 weeks for cabbage , morn , noon and night and it was never there . Alot of items are never there just an empty space . Or they carry am item and whn u go back there is another brand of the same kind of stuff but not the one u have been using .  Some items dont even give u a choice they only have one kind and that is that . Service is horrid , since April have only had one nice cashier . You cant get any help waited 30 min in fabrics and had to walk down to the photo lab 2 times to get them to page someone , and then the girl was mift she had to help me .
Negative	"Wow the aesthetic and design for this brand has really gone down hill.  That's nothing against this location's fault, they just stock what their pushed.

However, regardless of what I think of Express Clothing's direction is, the experience I had here was pretty much nonexistent.  No one spoke to me at all.  Even when I tried on 3 cami's and a sweater.  I picked up stuff and walked right into the dressing room with no one there.  I walked 2 laps around the store and no one said a word to me.  The store was dark and the racks were overstocked with clothes so it was difficult to see and shimmy out the right size."
Negative	"I refuse to go to TGI Friday's in Champaign anymore. I've been here around 4 times, and it's just not worth it. For the price, there are lots of other places to get a good meal in the area.
I'm very forgiving when it comes to service. I know that servers and waitstaff have a demanding job, and I tip well even for mediocre service. However, truly bad service is inexcusable. I came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita. When my drink was brought out, the server spilled the entire drink all over me. This isn't what bothers me. At another restaurant I'd be totally willing to forgive and forget. It happens. Her reaction was what soured the experience. She gave me a half-hearted, insincere apology and brought me out two extra napkins. Mind you, the full drink was all over my lap and running down my leg - not a two-napkin fix. I asked for more napkins, and it took a couple minutes, but she did come back. She offered to make a new drink, but I told her to forget it and bring me an iced tea. She did, and the meal was fine. The food is alright, but nothing spectacular. I had a cheeseburger and fries, and it was pretty good. I liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit. The real shock came at the end of the meal. We had separate checks, and not only was I never offered a discount or compensation for the server's mistake, but she tried to charge me for the margarita! I've had waiters slip up elsewhere, and while I don't think it's necessary to offer a discount, it sure is appreciated, especially when I've spent nearly an hour eating my meal and covered in sticky, cold margarita, through no fault of my own. A manager eventually came over to speak with me about the bill, and he ended up comping our appetizer and my iced tea. Still, the server's poor attitude ruined what could have been a pleasant evening out. I won't be back."
Negative	"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE  is the only way I can describe the wedding reception.  The owner stayed throughout the whole evening ""babysitting"" how much alcohol was consumed. From the owners own words"" We do have a bottle of alcohol that when we feel a guest has had too much to drink, we then give the guest the alcohol from the special bottle.""  Several of the guests complained of the owners attitude towards them, making them feel unwelcome.   Whole experience was a nightmare!  The owner argued with brides mother throughout whole process from beginning of planning reception until the very end of the night of reception.   Customer service is not high on their list!  Trust me when I tell you all this, I have never been treated this way dealing with any kind of venue.  Positives-nice room with attentive wait staff.  DONT DO IT!"
Negative	Okay, so this was mine and my boyfriends first place together. When we first moved in service and help was great with the staff. But then a few months later idk what happened, change of staff or something. I moved out in December and I've been trying to reach them for mail that i should have gotten for my son that was just born and they have yet to call back or even answer the phone! When we lived there, people were hardly even in the office at their business hours, lunches would be extended or started early, or they would even be hours late to open. Apartments in general were nice, the staff though, could use some work on. It takes alot for me to actually go out of my way to write reviews but maybe I'll get some kind of reply or hear from someone from the office now with this.
Negative	"The Pad Thai tasted like chicken noodle soup. Sushi was falling apart. The crab tasted like canned tuna. Every single type of sushi had the same sauce on top, Sriracha  mayo. 

Highlights 
-cocktails
-edamame 

Contours 
-service (slow and numerous mistakes)
-sushi (tiger and Hollywood) 
-Pad Thai 
-Expensive


Save your money. If you want sushi, go to Whole Foods."
Negative	Rooms are good but service outside of front desk or tower suites welcoming you is AWFUL. Doesn't matter if you are platinum mlife, they just like your money. I get it. It's a casino. The girl at the rewards desk just told me so. The guy at the pool earlier the same. I won a jackpot last night, took about 15 minutes to get anyone there to even pay out. They really only care to get you in here, not to make you stay. So sad because our first impression was amazing and we thought we would never go anywhere else when we come back to Vegas. Give it a full day and you will change your mind.
Negative	This place is way overpriced for what you're getting. With a great pizza restaurant down the street ( Streets Of New York) they gotta give me a reason to come back
Negative	Reservations is preferred .  The decor is a bit old fashion and kinda classy.  We dressed casual and didn't get good service.  We went with another couple and they agreed too.  My fillet mignon was okay and this place is very overpriced for the quality.  We had better service and experience even at an expensive taste.
Negative	"The burgers are delicious!  The beer selection is admirable! The service is garbage. My husband and I took a seat in the ""lounge"" to wait for friends.  We ordered 12 Oz beers because we were planning on staying a while to drink with friends and wanted to taste different types. We were served the 20 Oz beers. Not wanting to waste we drank them. We decided we wanted a snack. They have an extensive appetizer menu but we wanted to try the burgers. Not being too hungry,  we split a burger ""el machet"". (Rememeber we were planning on filling up on tasty beer and hiting the strip. Doggie bags are not good luck on the game floor) It was tasty but not very spicy. Just tasted like an average good burger.  We were hoping for something with more heat. Our waitress must have decided we were cheap since we split a burger and never came back for refills or to check on us. In fact we couldn't get anyone to refill our beer. I guess it was good the burger wasn't spicy! Finally the waitress unceremoniously dropped our check off without saying anything. We paid, left, and took our money else where. Joke was on her. Alcohol always spikes the bill = bigger tip. The next wait staff enjoyed our money. If we wanted a full meal we would have sat in the dining room. If you want good service and multiple beers go somewhere else. If you want to be judged on your order by the world's most mediocre waitress,  this is your place! I'll withhold her name for class ;)"
Negative	"This place should have stayed closed.  They re-opened after what seemed like forever, they had a building permit, but I never saw anything going in or out in the way of building supplies.

Viv and I went here from breakfast, and wow it was BAD!  I ordered over medium eggs and got something that might have still clucked at me when I poked it.  Viv got the french toast and it was very dry and tasteless.

The staff was friendly and the place is cute, but the food sucks and that's what you're really going there for.  They are only open for Breakfast and lunch, so I'm not sure how they are making any money as it seems the village comes alive at night.

Avoid it if you can.  I would take the Golden Griddle on Carlton over this place...and we all know how ick the GG is."
Negative	Wth. Pay for parking ?  Blocking off an entire section. Not even for valet. Prior Valet hoards all the parking spots during holiday season. Now this?  Trying to run the mall into the ground like metro? Well done
Negative	"Giving 2 stars because while the baked Brie was absolutely delicious we had a terrible server. She was gone long periods of time (which could be excused except it wasn't busy), she gave us a lot of attitude, didn't bring part of our order, and when we tried to order more she legitimately walked away for 10 minutes and came back with the check. 

To make matters worse the other 3 people I came with all got sick after eating there. They split the fried pickles and crab cakes. I'm unsure which one of those plates made them sick but it was either of the two."
Negative	"Valets put a HUGE DENT in our brand new truck. The hotel said they would pay the damages but when we sent the bill they REFUSED TO PAY FOR IT. 

$1000 to fix the damage.

Do Not Stay Here. Bunch of crooks. Ruined our trip to Montreal."
Negative	I ordered a BBQ beef sandwich meal which also came with one side and a drink. I had the potato salad side dish which was served in a small styrofoam container. The potato salad ok but not spatacular. The sandwich was awful. The BBQ was cut in small pieces akin to pulled meat instead of slices. Then the doused the whole sandwich with BBQ sauce which made the bread became so soggy that one cannot even picked it up. I ate the sandwich with a fork instead. The BBQ was ok. It is not close to Texas or Kansas City BBQ.
Negative	I have heard good things about this latest trendy breakfast restaurant so I decided to try it.  Unfortunately the entire experience was very disappointing.  I ordered the short stack of blueberry pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, and a glass of orange juice.  The total price was $14.95 before leaving any tip (which seemed very pricey even if the food wood have been incredibly good).  Unfortunately the food was very mediocre at best.  The place was not crowded and I was the only person in line to order food.  There were plenty of empty tables as well.  It took well over 20 minutes for my food to show up and it was not warm (not sure why it would have taken so long- no real reason) The pancakes were also  very dry (not fluffy, but flat and hard) and had only  5 blueberries scattered across all three tiny pancakes (when I ordered I was lead to believe the short stack pancakes would be very large, in reality they were each smaller than my first in circumference.  They did mention they were low on blueberries when they delivered my food and decided to substitute non-ripe/hard greenish strawberries instead and asked me of I hoped that was okay.  It would have been nice to have been told that before I ordered.  I didn't really have a choice since I didn't have time to wait for them to make me something else.  The bacon was actually good and the fresh squeezed juice was okay as well (I've had way better though - this was clearly a little watered down).  The meal didn't come with enough syrup either and nobody ever came around to offer more syrup or ask how everything was.  I personally love breakfast and am willing to pay for quality and good service.  Unfortunately my experience had neither of those.
Negative	"Stayed at this hotel in July 2013, and we booked a couple of rooms. The property itself is nice and we didn't find any problems with the room or the facilities outside of the absolutely revolting coffee in the morning that is included with the free breakfast. This property is mainly a family hotel and there were lots of families with lots of kids. It was really loud while we were there even in the late evening hours so if you are looking for a quiet place to stay you should look elsewhere. It appears to have been remodeled within the last couple of years so the rooms are nice and the hotel smelled wonderful. The problem is when you encounter the staff....I suggest that you STAY AWAY FROM THE STAFF ENTIRELY! The staff was rude to the point of being childish and obnoxious, and it was unsettling that they would behave this way. Our first run in with the staff was when we asked if they had some toothpaste since we forgot ours. There is a sign in the bathroom that says they have these types of items available at the front desk should you forget yours but they don't. The woman at the front desk gave me a 5 minute sob story as to why they didn't have them and my guess is they just dont provide them. If you need an extra blanket/pillow, shampoo or anything else they will make you walk to the front desk to get it as opposed too having housekeeping bring it to you. They do offer free breakfast but its pretty limited compared to other hotels. They offer waffles which you make using a waffle iron yourself, and our first morning there my son was making a waffle and ""Geneva"" at the front desk began yelling at him from across the lobby because she felt he was using the machine wrong. We stay at hotels all the time so we know how to use this machine and my son doesn't like his waffle to get too brown so he always takes it out early. When I heard her yelling at him I went over to him to help him get the waffle out and she then says to me ""He didn't wait for the buzzer so now he screwed it all up"". I was so shocked  that I didn't even know how to react and my son was upset. We made 3 waffles and went back to our room to eat breakfast and we never went back to the breakfast area during our entire stay because of the issue. I later asked for information to get in contact with the management and ""Geneva"" asked me why I wanted it. When I told her it was to discuss the awful behavior of the staff including herself she went crazy! She began yelling at me and then said she was angry with me because I made a whole bunch of waffles and just threw them away. I was so flabbergasted because this woman is not only lying and accusing me of something I didn't do but also because we didn't even make more then three waffles (one for each of us), we never threw any away, and we never even ate in the breakfast area or even went back to the breakfast area after this insane woman verbally accosted my son.  She told me that she runs the place because there ""isn't really anyone who manages them"" and said she is a manager but she is nothing more then a front desk clerk. It was one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had in my life, and I sincerely hope that the owners or operators of this hotel give their employees some hospitality training because what is going on there is completely unacceptable."
Negative	"As a long time patron of Richardson's I am always taking new people in and encouraging others to come downtown and try it!  This occasion, February 28, 2014, one of my good friends and I stopped in for a much anticipated lunch together.  This is the first time I have ever considered never returning.

The restaurant was not busy  There was only 12 people in the inside dining area between 11 am and 12:30. We arrived at 11am and chose to sit at the bar inside. The young woman at the bar greeted me and served me a glass of wine and then proceeded to continue her ""set up the bar"" duties.

 When my friend arrived we waited several minutes and then I had to call to the server to ask someone to take my friend's drink order. 5 + minutes later our server/bartender still had not brought the requested beer although the server/bartender was right there on the other side of the bar in full view. 3 feet away from us. Remember the restaurant was not busy.

We ordeedr the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer to share and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was amazing, as usual.  Unfortunately we could not seem to get ANY service for a glass of water or a second glass of wine.  Again I had to ask the server to please ask the bartender, or whomever was supposed to be working behind the bar, to please see if someone was available to serve us. At this point we still had not been able to order lunch.

The Bartender/ young woman who initially served us come up to take the drink order and I asked if the three salads on the chalk board were good.  She assured me they were excellent.  I am used to the house salad, which is excellent, and we assumed we could count on something of that quality. 

We ordered the beef tenderloin salad split and another glass of wine and a beer. 12-15 minutes later we still did not have our drinks. There was NO ONE new inside the dining room and one party out on the patio and several servers so as far as we could see there was no reason for the total lack of service.

Another 10-15 minutes and the salad showed up on one plate. 

This salad was a very un-inspired 'Cesar"" with limp flavourless beef flopped on top of a mound of rusty romaine lettuce and some basic croutons with some shaved Parmesan Crude and messy presentation and it was certainly not what we envisioned.

The server went to ""find"" some small plates and the salad was then deposited on the bar for us to split. No serving pieces were provided for us to accomplish this. She also did not offer to assist or to take the salad back to the kitchen to be re-plated. 

Maybe I am being picky here but I can get a terrible salad at any Denny's or Village Inn. Richardson's is known for service and quality. The service was non-existent. The salad was terrible, overpriced and tasted flavourless. The only thing that was good was the wine (which we had to practically beg for) and the shrimp appetizer which is all on the kitchen's skill.

So feeling very un-welcome and very disappointed in the salad, lack of service, and our expectations for a great lunch - we gave up and decided to forgo anything additional. 60 dollars later we were happy to just leave. 

I am terribly disappointed. Richardson's is my go-to restaurant for special occasions, lunch with friends, happy hour - you name it. I can go to Postino's (closer to my house) or Windsor, Zinburger - any number of other options for a great meal. I fully expect Richardson's uniquely prepared high-end food when I come here and for 60 dollars for lunch I would hope to be at least not frustrated and hungry when I leave."
Negative	Didn't even make it to a table, this restaurant was so filthy. The ventilation system was draped with dust collection (wonder how much of that ends up in the food), the floor was filthy, there was no enforcement of their posted dress code. We had a reservation for 630, arrived on time and hadn't been seated in 15 minutes. So instead of spending our money here we moved on, can't speak for the food or the cooks since we didn't experience it.
Negative	"Really crappy that when I come in it's not even a hi it starts with ""we can make whatever sandwich but only have the bagels that are in the case."" That should have been the sign to leave but I continued to look and place an order with one of their ""gourmet"" bagels. I go to charged out and noticed it was more and made a remark that I feel it's a little messed up that you only have ""gourmet"" bagels and you turn around and charge me more for my sandwich. It was like talking to the wall. The cashier said nothing just handed me the receipt and walked away."
Negative	"Very disappointed with 2 of 3 items we ordered! The third was good.
The carne asada taco was dry and very little flavor in meat.
The al pastor burrito had flavorless white beans and oddly flavored meat.
The only decent item was the buche taco. Good flavor on the meat.
The service was minimal until the cashier-- she was pleasant.
Doubt I will return."
Negative	I had the cookie sundae, just a sundae nothing special. Kids had spaghetti which was cold and a footling hotdog. Nothing special just a big tourist trap. Hostess said I couldn't stand near the heater outside and she was a rude B. Slow service, never refilled my coffee which was cold. I hated the decor....yuck!
Negative	What a dump!!!!  The Good Morning Vietnam was flatter than a board.  Wooden Robot should never sell them another anything if they are going to represent their product this poorly.  $1.50 for a glass of water, out of a pitcher!  Notice I didn't comment on the service.....there wasn't any!!  This is a place for snobs from Pineville to go to instead of NODA, Plaza Midwood, SouthEnd or any place else...doesn't really matter, I won't make the mistake of visiting this place again...the good thing is this place will be a cupcake place in 6 months.
Negative	"If you've been to Olive Garden, you've been here and you probably paid less for the same food and better service. 

The only reason I can see people hyping this place up is because they're drunk off the all you can drink red/white wine. I personally am not big on wine so I ate sober... 

Salad: It had a rectangular shaped peice of cheese on it and I think a cold cut slice of meat, which i was surprised by as I was asking about vegetarian items just 2 minutes before the salad came out... my mistake, I thought the salad was safe!

Bread: nothing special. Wasn't gross but it wasn't super offensive. 

Eggplant Parmigiana: I just have had better. The red sauce was bland and the eggplant was covered in cheese which was overwhelming. There was soooooooo much cheese.

Side of pasta: literally,  a side dish of penne pasta with more bland red sauce on it. 

Cappuccino: you know that machine at, like, all gas stations? Then you already know what this tastes like.

Service: not terrible,  but not super friendly or welcoming. Would it hurt to show some personality or ask some nom-invasive questions? Is this your first time here? Would you like to hear some customer favorites? Etc... no one explained the menu or asked us if we wanted anything other than the wine. We had to ask for a drink menu. 

Ambiance: really dark version of Buca did Beppo. Really. Dark. Inside. 

Overall, the word to describe this place is: meh."
Negative	"Crap restaurant, I was  just in there and overheard the manager saying ""stop taking orders"" I assumed he said that because he thought it was too much to handle. It really wasn't busy. The restaurant needs all new employees and management  #sorrynotsorry"
Negative	I would go to another Popeyes if I were you! After 30 years or more of eating Popeyes, a Louisiana native and a great cook I might add. I think this is the worst chicken I've had at a Popeyes, very dry and old. Also my order was wrong, but it seems they do that a lot! Steer clear, go up the road a few miles or just cook your own but DO NOT go here thinking it's authentic, it's the same recipe with poor execution!!
Negative	We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get.
Negative	"Their service was bad, though this is a nice chapel.
Nobody served us when my wife and I stepped into the chapel. They kept us waiting for a long time. The photos are not satisfiable as well. It was really hard for us to pick out six photos from scores of photos he took.
The only thing that I would recommend was the minister and the driver. I really love the minister's words and the driver was so kind that he took several pictures for us out of the chapel."
Negative	Going to switch all my direct deposits back to my california bank again, this credit union is inconsistent sometimes my direct deposit shows up Thu sometimes it shows up Fri, i dont like that just pick a day and be consistent.
Negative	"GIANT EAGLE PHARMACY ONLY. 
This us the worst pharmacy ever. 75% of the time they don't have my ex ready and that's with plenty of advance notice. Go anywhere else but here"
Negative	Waited 1 hour 20 min for dinner. Salad was very bitter.   Terrible experience.  Hard to watch other tables around us get sat, order, eat , then leave all while waiting for our pizza. $57 bill for a lot of frustration.
Negative	"Called on a Tuesday to verify when our next appointment was scheduled because the grass was getting a bit long and it had already been two weeks since our last service. I was told it was on the schedule for the following Monday. No big deal, we didn't want to receive an HOA warning letter so we went ahead and cut the front yard ourselves. Thursday someone shows up unannounced to service our yard and no one was home or available to unlock our side gate. I called the company to figure out what was going on and the unpleasant man on the phone informed me that my appointment had been changed for my convenience. Pretty hard for me to find any uncommunicated changes 'convenient' especially after he said he thought we were moving and that's why we needed the appointment changed. Sounds like they got their own wires crossed and possibly screwed up another customer's appointment for today, too. He told me they would stop the work and come back on Monday but I'm certainly not going to hold my breath. 

The work they did over two weeks ago seemed like a good job but I don't think they put any seed down in areas that needed it. Of course, they were very defensive when I asked about that in my initial phone call/inquiry. Two thumbs down for poor customer interaction skills."
Negative	This place was busy and looked like it had possibilities.  They really tout their Bacardi Rum lineage too.  My spouse and ordered different Rum Bowls. I had the sofrito pork bowl and she had the jerk chicken.  I also added the optional fried egg on top of mine.  Both came with beans and rice.  The portions are certainly generous.  That's where the good news ends though.  Both dishes had a sauce base of a thick, bland flavorless tomato sauce.  It was like something straight out of a can.  I added tons of hot sauce to no avail.   No heat, spice or flavor to be found in both.  To add insult to injury, the egg was fried hard and burnt.  The server was also MIA.  Take my advice, fly on by....
Negative	Food is kinda bland. I had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I could have gotten better chicken at KFC at a cheaper price. Service was slow but at least the servers were nice. Not the best of the grand cafes of stations casinos.
Negative	Hard to find a good electronics store.  I went here to buy an all in one printer, scanner, etc. and a new more upgraded modem/router.  Totally expecting to drop between $500 and $600.   I had many questions.  That's why i went to the store instead of online.  I picked out a modem/router but the didn't have the brand i was looking for.  then i went over to the printers.  Lots of sales people but not one of them asked if I needed any assistance.  I put the modem/router back and left.  i remember the guys from FyxIt telling me to go to Office Depot.  So that's where I went to purchase the modem/router.  haven't decided on a printer.  lots of choices there.
Negative	"My Wife made reservations for us at Palazzo for my Birthday. We had read that Lavo was great for the Sunday Brunch so we decided to start the day with the Brunch. Lavo opened at 10:00AM and we arrived a few minutes before opening. When we arrived there were already people in the waiting area therefore we figured that it would be best to check in with the hostess in case they get busy. 
Upon greeting the hostess we were given a strange look like what are you doing here and then she said can I help you. We told her we were there for the Brunch at which time she said they were not open and we could wait. Remember, we were three minutes early. We walked around until we noticed a couch near the dining area and we decided to wait here. After 20 minutes of waiting and watching an unorganized staff the hostess came to us and asked if we were waiting for a table. We told her once again that we were waiting for a table and she then proceeded to a table in the dining room for us to have a seat. We asked if the terrace was available as we had read that the terrace was nice. She did not know and had to ask a server who told her yes. The hostess then directed us to the terrace where we were seated and provided menus. 
After another 15 minutes of not being helped or even acknowledged we got up and walked out. As we left all of the wait staff was in the area and not one of the staff asked us if we needed anything. as we walked past the hostess station there was another employee there that appeared to have some level of authority as they were in business attire. As we were leaving I said to her that we were leaving after 30 minutes of waiting and there was not response. We left and went to Mario Batli's Enoteco Otto where we had a wonderful experience."
Negative	"Oh man. Somehow things got WORSE.

Firstly, I've seen firsthand a phlebotomist stick 3 people without changing gloves...

Second, they didn't pay me. Weird right? No cash out, i asked what happened. They said the bank system was down all day. I find it odd that they weren't telling people that from the beginning. Especially since it had been happening ALL DAY.

Third, i tried to call and ask for a manager to figure out what was going on and voice my concerns and was put on hold for 20 minutes all to still never speak to
a manager....

This may be it for me. I heard Talecris was better and had better new donor fees as well."
Negative	I can truly say this is the worst Hooters ever Customer service was terrible and the chef should really be fired they brought out chicken wings with no sauce fill with a whole bunch of grease it was so nasty that it made us sick and we had to send the drinks back because they were disgusting also you will definitely be waiting a long time to get your food like 45 mins to an hour on a Monday when there is no one In there BEWARE DON'T GO TO THIS HOOTERS you will be very disappointed !!!!
Negative	Stopped at this location because of the great experience we had at the location in Charlotte. Terribly disappointed with the meal! My husband and I ordered the smoked wing lunch basket and it tasted nothing like the other location. The wings were cold and looked as if the grill marks had been colored on. There was nothing smoked about them! I ordered Mac and Cheese as my side and an overwhelming smell of bleach like cleaning chemicals permeated from them that was extremely off putting. Ended up leaving without consuming the meal and feeling robbed of the money paid for it! The staff were friendly and they have cold ice and plenty of napkins to try end on a positive note.
Negative	"Very Disappointed!!  I've been too polished about 4 times and have never had this happen to me. 

I called for an appoinent and was unable to book because they require  You to pre-pay for your service when You book! I always see a good nail tech that does good designs (wynnie & Kim have been from the past) and I never had to prepay for my service nor have I ever missed an appointment!! Smh such a disappointment. Oh well, guess I'll skip the designs and head back to Creative Nails!"
Negative	"Wish I could give 0 stars.  Do not take your car here for service!!!!  My wife decided to take our 2013 odyssey here for an oil change.  She was finally called 2 hours later with a list of problems on our certified pre owned vehicle with only 30,000 miles that we bought less than a year ago.  She told the service tech, Kelly, that she didn't have time to have everything done because she needed to pick our daughter up at school.  He agreed that there was not enough time for everything and that just the maintenance stuff would be done.  My wife was never told any prices other than the quote of $150 when she dropped the car off.  She went to the dealership at the agreed upon time to pick up the car and had to wait 20-30 minutes for help even though she checked in with someone immediately when she arrived!  That made her late to pick up our daughter and so she was stressed.  Then upon check out they gave her a $600 bill!!!!!  She was so upset but had to pay so she could get the car and get our daughter.  She wasn't even told what was done and had cost so much.  Finally upon getting home she called me while I was at work to discuss the matter.  I was furious to see that new brake pads and rotors were placed on our car without her permission to do so and with no costs being discussed.  Being a business owner and knowing that I'd much rather have my customers discuss complaints with me before posting anything online, I decided to call and talk to the service manager and give him an opportunity to rectify the matter.  He did call me back to discuss the matter but all he did was justify the incident and say that his notes say that costs were discussed over the phone and permission given to do the fixes.  I guess the notes are obviously correct because then he made the comment, ""not to call anyone a liar, but that's what my notes say, so things must have been discussed and ok'd"".  He ended the call with apologizing that this had happened and that was it!  I will never take my car there again nor recommend them to any of our many honda owning friends!  Guess it was worth losing customers over!"
Negative	"This Place has a great Patio.... and umm did I mention the nice patio?

My first trip was in for a lunch. At some points we were the only customer. Yet our appetizer order was still omitted for some reason.

Our first selection of beer was also a bust, as the well worn paper beer list was not up to date.

My fish tacos were lacking to say the least. The fish was small and tasted like fried frozen fish sticks on old tortillas.

On another trip I got to try a few apps for happy hr. The Queso is nothing special with some franks red hot sauce on top. The coli-flour wings are just fried (not breaded) coli-flour with sauce and the nachos were quite weak with a sprinkling of cheese and some queso sauce and a dollop sour cream. A far cry from the nachos of my dreams from other local breweries. 

This location has been a revolving door over the years each business lasts 2-4 years, I wonder how long spokes will last."
Negative	"I will start by saying the food is always wonderful.  However, in the past year I have been there 4 times. My stomach comes out happy , but not me. 

Once I was there on a Sunday at 5pm, my husband ordered the special & I ordered a sirloin.  After we were eating our salads the waitress comes back to say they are out of the special.  Its 5PM!  When our food did arrive I received Prime Rib instead of my steak.  Still had to pay that price.
Another time I was there on a Thursday night,  My girlfriends & I had our drinks & the GM came over & asked us to move, he forgot to reserve that table.  So they put us back to table # 25.  It is horrible.  It is at the end of the bar, away from all other tables & the flow of the wait staff.  You would think after the inconvenience of the move they would comp an appetizer.
Just recently there again on a Saturday at 5pm.  Its busy I get it, not unusual.  When we finally seated, it was the damn table #25.  I di not say anything due to the rush of the evening.  However, because they were so busy,  all of the bar patrons & waiting customers were hovering over our table. It really puts a different spin on your dining  experience as people watch you eat!  We could not hear each other & the waitress could not hear us.  Again on a Saturday night they were out of the special before 6pm!
My thing is be prepared, they know they are a popular spot, have what you offer.  Also, I think they are trying to pack people in, that's why they will not give up the table # 25.  It needs to be turned into a waiting area, so people are not standing in the aisle ways."
Negative	"I had an appointment, had me sitting there for 20 extra minutes past the time while about 7 employees sat and chatted... 
Finally get to me and they tell me it's gonna be 2+ hours to get my screen fixed? I can go to the little Asian man and get it done for half the price and half the hassle. It doesn't take 3 hours to change out a screen. Get it together."
Negative	"I have been going to Jeniza nails in Tempe since they opened. I have been a very loyal customer. For every occasion I needed my nails done, I went to Jeniza. Unfortunately the quality of the service I've received has declined. I feel like the manicurists are not given enough time for each customer. They rush through the appointments just to get to the next customer (mind you, I most certainly show up on time to my appointments). Since they are not given enough time, the quality of the manicure is not very good either. The last time that I went, I picked a color, the girl put on the basecoat and one coat of the color. Apparently the ""brush"" was giving her problems but it turned out that the polish was dry! She came back and told me that they did NOT have the same polish. I was forced to pick a color I did not want. When I show up to a business, pay for a service and go looking for something in specific, I would think they would have it available. I was very disappointed. My mom and sister also go to Jeniza and lately, have experienced the same discontent with the quality of the service. We have all decided to not return because of this. Jeniza nails is not the same business it used to be. They are no longer concerned with the happiness of the customer, but with the amount of customers they can get through in one day."
Negative	"The first night we ate there we were impressed by the crab rangoon.  It was a nice blend of spicy, scallions and crab.  Some of the best eaten ever.  We also had the Island Red Curry and The Spicy Shrimp Rice.  Was average but the cost was ridiculously high.  $22 per plate and I do not mind paying that in Vegas so the overall experience was good.  The tables are old and chipped, very outdated to justify ambience, food and price but it was down to earth

Because the crab rangoon was so special, we decided to eat there a second night.  And of course started out with the crab rangoon.  The first bite, I thought, this is doughy, like it had been sitting out.  But then I though maybe my taste buds were off since I was so tired.  So I took a second bite and got a ball of ice.  So that means what I thought was so special was either a buy in or made and then frozen or they were going bad so they froze them.  No kidding, you just don't play with seafood like that.  The plate was sent back with forgiveness and the second order came.  Again, frozen.  When you give someone a second chance, there was obviously no pride taken in the cooking that night and we probably just hit it on a day when there was a high note but this seemed standard.  We showed the owner/manager the plate and had him touch the inside.  His face went sour and was so sorry.  I told him I was too but I am not playing when it comes to possible health issues, we were paying for nothing and leaving.  He did not try to make any good will gestures.  It left such a sick feeling in my stomach, we made several attempts to eat in Bally's and just got sicker by the minute.  It ended as a bad eating night and a belly full of hunger.  It was a good thing we had a fresh cupcake in the room.

Would I go there again?  NO!  The risk outweighs the first experience there and could lead me to getting sick."
Negative	Sat on patio for 20 minutes after being seated by hostess. Watched 3+ other tables order drinks, apps, and food. No waiter ever came over to us, despite going back to hostess after 15 minutes and asking about it. Not even a crowded night. Very disappointed. We left after 30 minutes with no service. Not even water. Ridiculous.
Negative	"So inconsistant, it's not worth the money.

I've eatten delivery three times now. Two times they screwed up my order, and one time they screwed up the other person's order. Infact the very last time, she ordered something straight from the menu, and they didn't put cheese on it, like the menu said. 

One time we ordered off their dessert menu, and they gave us something with beef in it. We called them to let them know and they actually argued with us. They tried telling us we were confused at what we were ordering. We ordered chocolate and we got beef, we wern't confused. They told us we wouldn't be getting our dessert unless we still had the beef things and we said that was fine...But come on, what are they going to do with the food after they delivered it? Plus, no one ever apologized or compensated us for a vegitarian biting down into a beef something when it should have been dessert!

The only reason why we tried it three times is because when they actually got the order right, the food was pretty good, and it's a great plus that they deliver practically always."
Negative	This is the 3rd time that we have eaten at this location and the service has been 0 stars every time. They take your drink order but fail to bring it for 10 to 15 minutes. This last Time we went there was Saturday, Veterans day and they  had 2 servers , were still setting up for the day, there were fewer than 10 people in the restaurant and it still took over 45 minutes to get our meal, waiting on refills, condiments etc, horrible service, last time for me at this location.
Negative	Told a 10 minute wait for table. Then when we were about to be seated told it would be a 45 min wait for food.  Seriously? The place was not even full. Also, the hostess was extremely rude.
Negative	The Casino itself is Meh, so so- nothing special. They have some interesting shops here, but the walkway to the Monorail is so long! They could have done a better job at placing it!
Negative	Long time to wait to seat and long time to wait for eat! Servicer was slow! Every thing need to remind service twice. And last thing the price is very high, yelp should update for $$$. Don't waist time and money on this restaurant!
Negative	"I walked in around 9pm hoping to get some goodies for the kid's, bakery was empty, one employee was cleaning the tables, I waited in the cashier area for about 5 mins, no one came to serve me, looked around, no one came to help, walked around again checked menu for 2nd time, still no one was present at service area, waited little longer, again no one to be seen in the horizon, the cleaning employee continue to do her job, I was buzzed and confused, why? finally gave up and started walking towards the exit hoping someone would attempt to stop me from behind with ""can I help you?"" question, nope didn't happen (only in my head), I continued to walk out of the store. I can't comment on food bcs I never got to taste it!.......I did get better luck at nearby wholefood...don't believe me? check your cameras!"
Negative	"I came here after work with a coworker. As we walked in, there was approximately 10-15 people waiting for tables, however there was no one in the restaurant and there were several tables available. As I stood there waiting, the hostess saw me as I walked in and she continued her conversation with her other co workers. She then took my name down and informed there was a 20 minute wait, however I was still in awe because the restaurant was empty. As we were waiting, another couple came in and they were seated prior to us. I believe the hostess name was Nauca (unknown on correct spelling), however she was rude and unprofessional. Even upon sitting us, she did not say a word, threw the menus on the table and walked off. 

Thankfully our server, Emily, was amazing. She was kind, prompt, and respectful. Her knowledge of the menu was excellent and she did not disappoint. We ordered the broil for two, and was not disappointed. The food was tasty. A lot of effort for little meat, however I enjoyed the experience and the flavors. 

The location is ideal and opened windows allow you to get a nice breeze. The ambience was good and appreciated the open layout. As mentioned earlier, I was just upset with our hostess and her attitude. I am not sure if I will come again just based on that."
Negative	"Went to Windsor Rose last night for wings and beer as my girlfriend likes the atmosphere. Have been here several times over the years and it appears that the staff have changed again! All new waitresses and manager. Seems like this place changes staff every 4 months. We ordered wings and beer, hot and salt and pepper and we waited. And waited. Wings came to our table 25 minutes after ordering. The hot wings were smothered in sauce and over cooked to a crunchy crisp. The salt and pepper wings were cooked better but had no salt or pepper on them. When I told the the waitress  this she shrugged and pushed the salt and pepper shakers at me! I said maybe the cook could do something about it, she gave me a ""don't be stupid"" look and asked if there was anything else she could help me with. I sent her on her way. 
We tried one more flavour to give them a chance at redemption and ordered some maple bacon. Now I pictured a sweat bacon sauce that would be wet and sticky, what came to our table was a bone dry wing with a coating of dust that had a faint taste of bacon, very artificial. 
It's too bad that there are so many restaurants that are Inconsistent with their service and food. I will be crossing this place off my wing night rotation for awhile. Beer was cold though."
Negative	After waiting for 20 minutes, I received my half full peanut butter bowl with about 4 pieces of banana and strawberry. Every other location I've been to fill the bowl to the very top. Next time I'll drive a little extra to get better experience somewhere else.
Negative	Service here is horrible. I would expect more from a new Bar in the area. I put $350.00 in the machines, and the Bartender was still worried about her tips instead of our business here. Comps are crap compared to any PT's in the local area. If I was you stay away. Thanks for a shoty (crapy) night out with my friends 08/01/2017 10:35pm... 49ers girl sucks
Negative	This place is the worst, small portions, overpriced, hit and miss service and vegetarians beware. Found pork in my curry and they gave me a hard time when I insisted on a refund. I used to go here all the time but it has gone downhill since they lost their manager to Gaati. Save yourself the trouble and drive a few extra blocks to Gaati instead.
Negative	"Oh Ulta, just when I thought you couldn't get any snootier you go and do something like this...

Always consistently rude when a problem is presented. This is the third time I have bought a product from this location only to open it and discover someone has swatched it, touched it or otherwise harassed what I was expecting to be a brand new item. I called and the person on the phone was rude, unapologetic and said in a snippy tone ""well as long as you have the receipt we can do an exchange."" Uh, thanks? I didn't dig my fingers into the primer- some weirdo customer did. I have been an Ulta beauty member for a long time now though I am unsure why I continue to go back. So predictable!"
Negative	Terrible experience. My dentist retired recently and I was looking for a new doctor. Not only the doctor was not available for a basic check up on my first appointment, the cleaning was half assed and purely superficial. Waste of time and money. Will not go back again.
Negative	"Unfortunately like a lot of the other reviewers my experience with Ashlee has been horrible and sadly it's still not over yet. Purchased a kitchen table set and a bedroom set for my daughter. Upon delivery we noticed the bed was the wrong size. We ordered a full size and was sent a twin. The manager called back after we sent the wrong items back and assured me that he would arrange to have the correct pieces delivered on that Friday, but couldn't confirm until the following morning (Thursday). I called the store Thursday morning to follow up since I didn't want any more delays and talked to the store manager again. He again assured me that the order would be placed. Called the store again later that day just to make sure and found out the order was never placed and that it was too late to schedule for Friday delivery. Soonest I can get the bed now is Tuesday of the following week. 

Completely dropped the ball on rectifying a bad situation. Offered in store coupons to compensate for my time and the fact that my daughter has had no bed for over a week. Like I want to subject myself to more agony, I don't think so. 

We'll see on Tuesday if this nightmare continues. 

Won't be doing business with Ashlee again that's for sure."
Negative	"If I could give less than one star I would. 
Nobody informed me that I was signing a contract for a 2 years and now I'm stuck paying every month for a membership I do not want and am not able to cancel it unless I pay $585. This is ridiculous! I will NEVER recommend this gym to ANYONE and if anyone were to ask I would definitely share my experience with them and warn them to not go there."
Negative	Showed up on a Thursday night, no reservation, got a table for two with no problem. It appears to be a street taco stand, but it's actually a hipsterish bar with an over the top unnecessary DJ. We were not thrilled with the drinks.. We returned both the Neville island tea and the blood orange frozen concoction. Way too strong, as it should be for $10, but we weren't trying to get drunk without appeasing our taste buds at the same time. The food was pricey... You can get the same quality at a Mexican taco stand for $2.00... And it's much more authentic. You'll like this place if you like throwing away money for an interesting twist on classic Mexican cuisine. $16 for two shrimp tacos, or $75 for a board of 12. They are definitely making a killing here, but not from my wallet, I won't be returning.
Negative	"This place was a complete circus show! Went in on the 4th after ordering online to go walked in waited In line for 10 mins to find out our order had not even been put in yet, after being told 10- 30 mins to pick up, waited 40 to give them time . I was rudly told "" well I'm way to busy to even care about to go orders today and it's not my fault your shouldn't have ordered online "" so I waited for another 35 mins before my order was even put in. As I waited I watched atleast 20 plus other food orders be returned due to error and not one customer was given an apology or actually given a proper order.  The manger stood there like a deer in headlight letting these cashier's take the heat for his errors , mind u he was the Cook making the errors. So after 1 hour and 15 mins from my order time I was rudely thrown my bag of food and reminded how much my $50 order of McDonald's grade burgers was a giant inconvience for them, or final order was completely a hot mess of its own. My husband's burger was covered in a topping we specifically told them not to put on it due to an  extreme allergy . I than requested a new sandwich , not willing to risk an allergic reactions , Instead I watched the manager scrap of the unwanted stuff off try to put his sandwich back together . Every ones food was cold hard and half put together . After waiting that long and the mishap I expected better and atleast some common decency or apology . Nope just a bad attitude and a staff that reminded us constantly that is was OUR fault not theirs for ordering to go a service they advertise all over they do . Well they had no problem charging me for the to go  order with in 5 mins of receiving it  but had a major problem actually making it. American burger you should see what this branch is doing to represent your chain . To top this my family than missed our plan for the evening thanks to a 2 hour ordeal just to get some road kill quialty food ."
Negative	"Everything good in this airport is RUINED by the obnoxious level of loud music playing by terminal D7 at ""The Local Rustic Market"". I was unable to talk on the phone or hear any announcements about my flight status over the music. I asked if they could turn it down and the manager suggested I walk down the hall, away from my gate in order to be able to hear any announcements from the gate. Stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion."
Negative	"The pizza was okay... It reminded me of like a slightly better little Caesars. Hey it was cheap why am I really complaining.  Well.... I dined at noon on a weekday in the summer. The building was empty- no biggie- except I was stared at almost the entire time I was eating. The most awkward note to eat ever. Service here is terrible, paired with the ""EHH"" food I do not recommend! 

Sign on the front said grand opening so maybe new owners because the previous results were so great!"
Negative	"Although the atmosphere was pleasant at first, I quickly realized this is a breakfast place for alcoholics. The wait was outrageous. Service was okay but not great. Food was just okay and didn't match the price. Quite expensive for a breakfast joint. Turns into a loud ""club-like"" atmosphere after 9AM. I live around here and highly recommend Butterfields instead."
Negative	For me the pizza is too expensive and and the flavors too exotic. For example, I tried the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza. It isn't bad, but I'm in no hurry to go back and order another. If you're in the area, I'd recommend going to Claim Jumpers instead.
Negative	"Normally, I have sworn by this location for good bagels but lately, their service and their FUNKY ATTITUDES have made me not only pissed off but giving them a straight up 1!  I asked for a toasted bagel w/nova lox and asked if my onions could be thin cut. Their manager has given me thin cut onions any time I've ever come in up until recently.  There is no manager within earshot and these hateful counter people that they have currently haven't a clue on what customer service is!

They get a 1 for shitty counter service!"
Negative	moving to a different doctor.The place was recommended  by a friend. Unfortunately they are not compassionate or patient orientated, they are BUDGET orientated and don't  care about you just the money the make from you. After being on hold for 20 mins twice, leving voicemails twice and talked to 4 different people trying to get a refill for my birth control...amazing ha? They needed me to go all the way down there to just give me a refill of my medication, just because guess what? They need it to charge me for something. They didn't care that I was running out of my medication or else. What do you need a doctor that you can't count on? Or trusts when you are in need?? Go somewhere else, you'll thank me later. VWFW Shame on you for not taking care of your patients.
Negative	The renovations are now impacting the quality of my YMCA membership. There is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm? What a joke!!!!!!!!! I'm about to cancel my membership. This is garbage
Negative	"My review is for the Golf Course as I've never stayed at the hotel.

This course was one of the first courses in Arizona to have grass on it and has hosted a number of U.S. Presidents in it's time. It is a staple of the City of Chandler, and it is surrounded by beautiful large custom homes. The course has gone through it's share of ups and downs during it's almost century long existence, and unfortunately it seems to be at it's worst right now. I played on this course this last Sunday and was so disappointed. There was hardly any grass left on the course, the sand traps were like concrete, and the greens were in terrible shape. One of the pro's said that the course is in receivership and they are hoping someone will buy it and bring it back to it's once great self. As of right now they are placing band-aids on it and it shows. I would call ahead and ask the shape of the course before playing, and until they at least start watering it again, I'd avoid it. Very sad."
Negative	"This is not ""authentic Italian food"". We should have known it was going to be bad when no one else was in the front dining room. Are French Fries authentic Italian food? Just asking... Our meal started with bread service and olive oil for dipping. This was the highlight of the meal. The salad was drenched in mustard vinegar. Next up was our 24 dollar steak. Now when I order a 24 dollar main course I kinda expect the waiter to explain that it only comes with fries. No vegetables, no nice starch side, no authentic Italian anything. The steak itself was garbage quality, full of fat and bones. Lastly the waiter was in denial that this food sucked. I asked him what was a signature Italian dish? He just said pasta, it was obvious that we had a bad dining experience when we left over half the meat and the Authentic Italian French Fries on are plate. I'm not sure how desserts are here because we just left. In short DO NOT go here."
Negative	"It is free but it sucks. Went on Memorial Day weekend with my girlfriend and I was hopeful to see the pirate show like when I was a little kid. What I saw was literally Girls Vs. Guys in gendered boats. I thought I was going to see a pirate battle but what I saw was poor acting, lip synching, cheesy porno, wardrobe malfunctions and less fireworks. 

I wonder what wise executive had the idea to change the original pirate battle??? This show sucks. With further research I realized that the pirate show was removed and replaced with this garbage. Bring the pirates battles back!!"
Negative	"Zero stars for them
Do not trust these guys , they are false , they overcharge and have an exceptionally bad customer service . We moved from Brampton to Boston and the sales person Mr Bonder gave us a delivery date (in writing ) based on which we decided to go with this company . I was in my last trimester of pregnancy and we had to move in winter , we wanted the move to be as quick and hassle free as possible . 
In spite of me repeatedly confirming the delivery date ( which was approx 5-6 days from them picking up our stuff ) we did not get our stuff untill three weeks from the pick up date . we were sleeping on bare floor untill then. 
We had to call everyday to ask for the status and were not given the right information anytime. The owner of the company Mr Ibrahim would rarely talk to you and if you want to talk to any supervisor , they would just hand the phone to another employee, which were very rude. Mr Bonder never picks up his phone or returns your call . 
And to top it all they didn't even assemble our furniture when our stuff finally came , the guy unloading said that it is not their job to assemble . But they did disassemble our furniture and conveniently lost the screws for it . 
We were not given any discount or compensation for all the trouble that we went through because of them. When we said we are not going to pay the full amount the lady supervisor radios in the driver to shut the door and leave with our stuff."
Negative	"This restaurant takes the classic TGI Fridays concept of nailing random shXt to the wall and hanging more from the ceiling to a whole new level. The randomness is truly awesome, including a massive cow wearing pink cowboy boots hanging above the bar. I don't know what it means. I don't think anyone knows what it means. But, it's there's and those that notice it, get to wonder why!?

As for the food, it is unseasoned, uninspired, and boring, boring, boring. Two for one frozen margaritas from a machine, on the other hand, where pretty darn tasty. 

So, I'd come in during happy hour, skip the other three people who will be there even though the place easily seats over one hundred, and stare in wonderment at the random paraphernalia. It's worth a star in my as yet undefined Yelp review scale from dreadful to awesome."
Negative	"Rude. Rude. Rude. Too bad, because its a nice place. But I can't get over how rude they were. Especially the loud mouth girl with the long hair..Lisa I think? 

My mother in law and I walked in to get a pedi and mani. They said right away that they could only see one of us. I let my mother in law go since she was here on vacation. They set her up for her pedi. At the same time another girl walked in and request services. An older lady in the front told the girl who was just about to work on my mother in law, to help ""the blonde girl"" first.

 Meanwhile the lady in the front also kept telling the other girls not to take me because they only had room for one. It was already established that I would not be getting anything done! 

Once they took the other girl before my mother in law (she was already in the water!) , I grabbed her and we walked out! 

Never will I go back there!"
Negative	"Ate here and we won't be back. First off what a dumb way they have the line arranged, the line should come in from the left and ""move"" along the counter. If this place was busy (which it was dead when we went) it would be a nightmare to navigate that line and checkout mess.  They should get money back from who ever designed that store. The burritos were tiny, gave us a small scoop of beans small scoop of rice that she scraped from the bottom of the container, topped it with some meat and pico/lettuce but it just was nothing to come back for. My 9 year old told me he was going to need two burritos because they were tiny. Would rather go to cafe rio or chipotle or the other numerous Mexican joints around town where you actually get a decent portion for your money.  I will be Shocked if this place lasts another year!"
Negative	no more, due to the governor got one of the employees fired because he felt that he did not agree with the political ethnics...So the governor got mad and requested that the owner of reids or manager to fire this cook...What lame ass ass of the governor to do this..
Negative	"No wonder Lebron left Cleveland, he probably had drinks at this place. Beer is beer but the service here is atrocious. We were here along with a wedding party, complete in tuxes and fancy dresses. Still the manager started by refusing to serve 2 of them because he says a woman who had just walked 1/4 mile in high heels was stumbling. You try it sometime buddy. Then we asked them to call us a cab. A half hour later, no cab, but they kicked all of us out. A half our after that, still no cab, a dozen or so of us hanging out in the parking lot waiting. The manager walks by to his car, ignoring us. ""You're just going to leave us here?"" I asked. He shrugged and said, ""They said they're sending cabs"". Then he got in his car and drove home. After maybe 30 more minutes we walked several miles home instead of waiting for cabs that were never coming.

I'm not saying they didn't call us cabs, I know they can be slow in Cleveland. But as the manager of the establishment, shrugging your shoulders isn't good enough. I guess next time he prefers we drink and then drive home because he clearly doesn't care."
Negative	Below-average pizza with rude hosts and plus, you can only pay cash! Over-hyped at best! Before you dismiss this as a customer having a bad day: We ordered a napolitana that was salty to the point of inedible (my poor mom stayed polite though). We also ordered a gnocchi a la bolognasa, which turned out to be the most horrific pasta I have ever tasted. Gnocchis boiled in saltless water (tasteless then) and with salt sprinkled on them. The gnocchis shattered as I approached them with the fork. The bolognase smelled like pork while the hosts insisted it was pure beef. Don't waste your time here. There are plenty of good Italians in that neighbourhood.
Negative	Why would you be open when you don't serve food? Lock your doors if you're not serving food. Stopped in for a late lunch and was told I could drink but not eat.
Negative	Poor service, and food, have been there several times in the past, great food and customer service previously. This time, lunch and happy hour were horrible! You'd think that after spending almost $200.00 in one day, that I could expect great results, but no luck- lunch was scallops served cold, supposed to be hot. Happy hr included prime beef skewers that were tough and had to be spit out. The worst part was, no one cared. No waitstaff or manager EVER came by to check or ask how anything was! Beware if you try this place!
Negative	"This pizza joint probably has some of the worst service. Pizza delivery takes forever. On top of that the orders I've placed in the past were very frequently screwed up. I often ordered their taco pizza, which I used to love. I would always order it without onions, and the pizza would almost always come with onions on it. Recently when this occurred, we called back and complained and they granted us a ""free"" pizza the next time we ordered. Today we tried ordering our free pizza and they told us they had no records of us being titled to a free pizza. Not only that but our pizza once came with a hair in it. Called to complain and they hung up on us. A few times we called to order pizza and no one answered the phone. And finally on one other separate occasion, my boyfriend accidentally gave them an extra $20 tip in top of the 10$ tip we originally planned on giving the delivery driver. Called to try and see if they could understand the mistake and they confirmed that one of their drivers did in fact receive a very nice tip, and of course the money was gone and that there was no possibility of refunding the money back to us. 

Their plain cheese pizza isn't that good, and their jalapeño poppers are terribly soggy. The cheese fries always come prepared differently. Sometimes we get a cold cheese sauce on the side, or melted on top? Either way I will no longer be ordering from this establishment again, after time and time again of bad service and rude staff, I've had enough. I definitely do not recommend."
Negative	Service was beyond slow.Had rsvps for 7:45 - was sat at 8:00.But did not leave until after 10 due to the SLOW arrival of our food.Actually had to go ask for hot sauce for oysters after waiting over 15 minutes. Half of the mussels weren't opened&very little broth, but several rocks! Halibut was VERY dry and over cooked. The dessert was stale. At this point after dealing with it all, we asked for the cake to be taken off the bill. The waiter said manager said no. We asked for the manager to come over. He was THE biggest ahole I've ever met. Very condescending & said cake was fine. Asked us what we wanted him to do. How about learning how to treat your customers for starters.Only independent restaurants from now on. And restrooms had no tp
Negative	Very slow service. Food not impressive. Also very crowded. Waitress visited our table to get drinks, take order, drop off food and then check. Took forever in between each. Won't come here again.
Negative	More like Sushi Booooo! We dined but the quality of the fish was awful! I really question the freshness of their products! You do get what you pay for! We'd rather go to Tachi or Kaizen.
Negative	"Cold beans cold rice and cold burrito.  It still took 15 min and I was the only one in line!   All was paddled out of a pre made bowl.  The meat want even but on a grill to warm up!   And I had to ask for my drink. 
Pass"
Negative	The absolute worst piece of garbage in Las Vegas, and that includes the trash on the sidewalks.  Anybody who wastes their money on this gets what they deserve.  Saw the original Cirque-and-dancers version when it opened, then walked out of the revamped version two years later.  From awful to no-excuse-for-continuing-to-exist, this is the most pathetic thing I will ever see.
Negative	DO NOT USE THEM. They are a rip-off and deceptive. The lines at the rental counter are over an hour wait. And when you get to the counter, they dont have any cars available and don't have a time of when cars will be available. I asked why do they accept reservations in the first place, but they don't have an answer for that. I booked for a full-size car. I said was willing to wait for mid-size also. But after waiting for a bit longer, I realized I was going to be late for my original plans. So I accept a compact. But they said i had to pay the full-size rate that i reserved for. I was in rush, but I later realized from the paperwork the rate was even higher than my original reservations. So in the end, I was stuck with a downgrade and paid more.
Negative	"First of all, there was a hair in my burger... I had to cut that piece of my burger out to finish. 
Ruined my appetite.  The air conditioning wasn't working properly so it wasn't much of a relief from the summer heat inside. And they had signs up promoting their ""BBQ summer burger,"" but when I ordered it, the employee told me ""I'm sorry but we haven't started serving that yet.""  Then take your signs down that are all over your restaurant advertising it!  And don't call it a summer burger if it's the middle of summer and you haven't even started serving it. 

This was my first time eating here and it will most definitely be my last.  Next time I'll be sure to go to Five Guys directly across the street!"
Negative	"I live in the area and have been eyeing this place to try it out. I ordered 3 hard shell tacos with sides of black beans, rice and a beer (served in a massive goblet). The tacos were mostly filled with lettuce and very little protein filling, but they were each under $3 so I can't complain too much but it did make me want to go home and make my own. The rice and beans were really salty, which is why you need all that beer! The peas in the Mexican rice were not fresh; shriveled like raisins. 

Also the self service policy is not really clear, when your buzzer goes off you go up to the kitchen window and pick up your order. I wasn't sure since I saw the cashier go up there herself a few times. Felt kind of odd to do. Each taco was in a separate basket, that seemed like a waste. I wish there were hot sauce options that were mild, they're all way too hot.

Overall I'd probably try another place for tacos in the future. They have a lot of improvement to do."
Negative	This place is a joke I waited in line for 15 minutes to order my food  I placed my order and I asked how long and he said it would be 25 minutes because he only has one cook this is a obviously a franchise owned store obviously the owner doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.  I will never ever step foot in the place again.
Negative	"So, I've visited both the Tivoli Village & Town Square locations and both of them receive the 2 star review. 
Maybe I'm spoiled after living in SF for 10 years and having some great sushi. Or maybe this place just doesn't get it. One of the more important components of a roll is the rice. It has to be perfectly sticky & be consistent in the ""hold the roll"" department. Both locations failed miserably at the rice. It's the basic component if this meal! The rice was either brittle, dry & fell apart or it was cold, rubbery & BLEH! 
Once the rice thing fell apart, it was pretty much downhill from there with flavoring & consistency. However, service at both locations was good and pleasant, our Town Square experience with Ana was great!"
Negative	We went to Scottsdale specifically for wine tasting at Carlson Creek Vineyard because of the reviews. Checked their schedule and days opened, arrived at 12:40  on a Wednesday, the door was locked and no one there. It was disappointing since we wanted to try their wines. We ended up wine tasting at another winery in Scottsdale. I even called and left a message questioning why it was closed and received no response.
Negative	Got food poisoning here. I ate here for breakfast yesterday morning. I had a bacon, egg, cheese biscuit, a sausage McMuffin with no egg, and a hash brown. Couple hours later I got violently ill. Started running a fever of 102.7. I know it was this place because I didn't eat dinner the night before and I didn't eat anything after I had the McDonald's. Here it is the next day and I'm still miserable. I will never eat here again.
Negative	"Nice ambiance and decor with an upscale veneer but no real effort on food preparation. Waitstaff was exemplary and gratefully recommended the Quinoa Salad which was the saving grace that evening. Since they were out of the only grass fed beef (veal) we decided to pass on the rest of their beef offerings. (You'd understand if you've seen CJD!)
Halibut À la Plancha Paella Style was overcooked dry and flaky. The paella had good flavor but was obviously not freshly made. Pulled Porc Poutine was not fresh as well. Fries must have been refried several times they were dry darkened and shrunken. 
Cocktails were ok, nothing special."
Negative	"I rented a bounce house for my child's 3rd birthday party. The morning of the party, we were given a text discouraging us with going forward with the rental because at the time, it was raining. The text concluded ""probably would not be a good experience for them and I would hate for you guys to get something you cannot use"".
After the encouragement of not going forward with it, we made other plans. Nowhere in the discouragement of the text or phone call that was made, was it mentioned that we would not get our $150 deposit back, but in 12 month credit. I have no use for $150 bounce house credit in the next 12 months. 
After a phone call and a snarky ""have a blessed day"" I'm pretty certain they are the one with the blessed day as they kept the $150 of my money that they discouraged me from moving forward with my original plan, and failing to mention to me I wouldn't get my deposit back. What makes it even worse, is the rain had stopped in time for his party, so it would have been just fine. 
Definitely feel cheated and will certainly not recommend them to anyone. Hope it was worth it to them for their $150."
Negative	"Not impressed the food was over seasoned and even the patio was loud.Should cactus salad have cactus? Mine didn't.

I have to lean towards Bill M's response. I think the name and location makes this a so called ""hip""place to go. I just prefer to taste my food not have it covered up with ""a hint of lime""which must have been a whole lime. Not real anxious to go back but who knows."
Negative	This place is absolute shit. Came in with a positive mindset and happy to get some pizza and looks like this location hired a bunch of people with bad attitudes. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, in fact I'll probably never go to Domino's again. Worst experience ever.
Negative	Tried their cinnamon square/bun and a chocolate s'mores square with the vegan frosting at this year's Veg Fest on Queens Quay. First time trying, and I am no stranger to vegan baked goods. Had my husband and two other friends with us. We all ordered the same thing, all all ended up NOT finishing them. We threw them out. They were horrible. Very dense and hard, so overly sweet, quite honestly both were gross and very overpriced. I sure as heck won't be going back there and do not recommend this place if you're looking for tasty pastries or cakes. Yuck!
Negative	"DO NOT believe what the store rep tells you about current promotions, check the website yourself.      I was reassured by the store rep that Samsung had extended its promo for a free smartwatch or VR goggles with games when in store 3/19/16.  Also that Verizon was still offering a special trade-in on any smartphone minimum of $100.  The store manager Brandon had a ""too bad, so sad"" attitude, saying it was a Samsung promo, and he refused to honor what his sales person promised.  On top of that, after not receiving my trade-in promo code for 10 days, I am again told, too bad, that promo ended 2 days before I purchased, even though I was told it was still in effect.  So minus a $600 value for two smartwatches and $200 in trade-in value, I was given two VR goggles, but of course not that game bundle."
Negative	Very disappointed about the customer care I received as a female. I've spent close $1000 dollars at this place of business on the recommendation of a family member. I purchased brakes within the last 2 months and had to go back and pay for a so called upgrade. The manager haggled back and forth with me about the brakes and also charged me for the brakes not the difference between what i already paid. Lol he didn't charge me labor though. Today I trusted them to put 1 tire rod on and a wheel alignment while the rushed me out for the pizza they had being delivered. (Because they spent a half hour on my vehicle) Plus they messed with my window i told them about last week when they took advantage of me with the alleged new  brake job. I get home pull into the driveway all is fine. I back out only to hear this terrible high pitch sound and smell of hot rubber coming from my car. I will be reaching out to everybody that's willingly to hear my story. Because I feel that I was taken advantage of because of my lack of knowledge about cars and because I'm a woman. I see why women  take a man along  because of the sheisty dealings we get. Now I have to be inconvenienced  to go back out to get my car fixed again. I truly believe the service tech did something to my car to make me have to come back. Ntb WILL NOT GET ANOTHER QUARTER FROM ME. THEY ARE MONEY HUNGRY!!!!!
Negative	"DO NOT USE. This review also pertains to Go! Airlines in Hawaii. See their reviews. I only post here because this company sometimes books as ""Mesa"" and tries to trick you into not seeing their horrible reviews under their actual operating name, Go!. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY. The most horrible travel experience I have ever had."
Negative	"This was my first time in here.  I don't know if it was an off day and I'm completely up for editing this review if that's the case.  However, when we got there we were seated and didn't see a waiter for about ten minutes.  No drinks, no water, nothing.  The bartender came over and apologized and took our order.  Then, another twenty minutes.  Still no drinks.  They brought out our food.  Still not even a water.   About halfway through the sandwich they finally brought some water and our shakes.  Seemed like we weren't the only ones either-there was a family of six that was standing by the front waiting on what looked like a to-go order of shakes that were there for most of the time we were.  I know places get into the weeds sometimes, so I hope it's better next time.  

Also, I thought Nashville Hot Chicken sandwiches were dipped in sauce.  This one just had a bit of powder.  Still pretty good, but without the sauce it seems more like a glorified McChicken.  Shake and fries were good though."
Negative	"The only thing I hate more than frat boys is the smell of patchouli! This bar is full of hippies smoking cloves and hipsters who think this place is the place to be. 

There were plenty of hot chicks and a few cute dudes. One of the door guys was sexy. 

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because hipsters are only a little bit better than bros"
Negative	I tried it twice. Once it never bothered to show up after an hour of waiting so I took another taxi. The second time I needed to be at Pearson at an unreasonable hour. I planned to use Uber because of a discount code. The app wouldn't let me hail a car. Utter waste of time. I'll just keep Beck on my speed dial.
Negative	My husband and I have eaten here often and it is ok.  I always order the same thing - Wildfire Chicken  salad which I just love and I have no complaints about the food.  However, the service is terrible.  We were there about 11:30 on a Monday morning.  Took about 5 minutes before anyone showed up to find a table for us - we had our 12 year old granddaughter with us.  After about 10 minutes the server showed up and took our drink orders.  After about another 10 minutes she came back and took our food orders.  The food was fine and we enjoyed the meal.  However, that was the last time we saw our server.  She disappeared.  We had finished eating and my granddaughter wanted to use the facilities and my husband went to wait outside the door for us while I waited for our check.  No one showed up - then I asked another server where the server was and was told she didn't know.  I asked her for our bill.  After about 10 minutes my husband was concerned and came back to see what had happened to us.  The server still didn't show up.  Finally, another server came by and placed the chick on the table and left.  No explanation, no apology  - nothing.  The service here is always slow but this was beyond slow.  I couldn't find the manager so sent an email to corporate when I came home.  That was a week ago and I've never even received an acknowledgement of them receiving my email.  I strongly suggest going elsewhere - Cracker Barrel and Eat 'n Park are both directly across the street.  Go to one of them.
Negative	"well I was very polite with the associate that was helping me...and he was doing way too much with an extreme attitude!! nose to the ceiling and he was extremely rude!!
Im not saying they are all accountable for Brandons attitude, but he sure needs to check it at the door!!"
Negative	"My colleagues and I went to Parkway Tavern for happy hour. We are all educators and come to this location often. Recently, the service has been slowly deteriorating. In this particular instance one member of our group was about to leave early so she asked for her bill. When she received it, she noticed she didn't receive the happy hour prices so she notified the waitress. The waitress didn't seem very experienced...to put it nicely. The waitress told us that because she took our order at 3:57 that we did not receive the happy hour prices. We told her we knew what time it was but assumed that she knew we were ordering off the happy hour menu and expected the prices to correlate. Common sense would be to wait to put the order in until 4 o'clock or alternatively, say something like ""hey by the way, happy hour starts in a couple minutes, would you like me to wait to enter your order until then?"" Anyways, we asked to speak to her manager. He came out and said he wouldn't honor the happy hour prices so we used our teacher discount. They give teachers a 25% discount if we show our CCSD IDs. It definitely wasn't as cheap as it should have been. He should have honored the happy hour prices. Not doing so for 3 mins is not very tasteful. Now we are going to take our business elsewhere. Which sucks for them because us teachers love to have a drink after a long week of ya know... just educating our youth. No big deal. 

Oh BTW, I also got overcharged for pizza toppings. It said $.75 per additional topping but they charged me two dollars for sausage and it didn't specify whether meat was more expensive than veggies. We took photos of all our receipts and are contacting corporate."
Negative	ordered a rum cake after buying a groupon.  was really, really disappointed.  the outside looked like a cheap wedding cake, and the inside didnt taste any better.  we ordered it for the holidays, and everyone agreed it was the worst dessert served.  next to the rock springs pies, it was a compete disaster.  most of the cake ended up in the trash.  definitely wouldn't order another one again.
Negative	This place is brand new in Ahwatukee and I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered the Korean Pork BBQ wrap, which came with a small side salad with a vinaigrette. The wrap was not very tasty (bland) and was kind of small, considering it was $9. There was only 1 very small piece of BBQ pork in the wrap, which was very disappointing. The salad and vinaigrette were just ok. I was expecting a lot more. Too bad.
Negative	"Terrible service, terrible quality disc of images. 
We bought a photo shoot from DMs photography through groupon. The deal seemed pretty good, and although we weren't expecting anything spectacular, we're left with completely un-usable images. I asked Harry a few times for his pricing list to get some prints, he kept putting it off and only gave us the pricing list after we had chosen the proofs that we wanted (which were difficult to choose since the watermark took up the entire photo). The prices were ridiculous! We reluctantly paid for some more images and waiting for our package to arrive. In the groupon deal, a disc was provided... which is the main reason we went ahead with this photographer. When I printed off some extra pictures from the disc, you couldn't even make out our faces, they were terrible! I printed a whole bunch to put in Christmas cards and they were completely unrecognizable. When I confronted him he sent me a very long winded email (that I'm sure he had send out many times before) about how the images on the disc are not meant for printing. Working with Harry was a disappointment and utter waste of time."
Negative	Highly disappointed in the outcome of my nails! I went for a manicure and powder nails and explained that I would like for my nails to look the way they do now. The first technician told me she couldn't do powder and then the second technician that helped me said she wasn't going to do the manicure because it would interfere with the glue used for the powder. That should've been a red flag seeing as how I normally get manicures and then powder nails done at my usual nail salon. Fast forward an hour and a half later, she's finally done with my nails and they're buff and look terrible. Nothing about my nails look natural which is what I had when I got there. This looks like I was playing dollhouse with my niece and told her she could paint my nails. My husband couldn't even pretend to like these nails. I won't be back to this salon. There were a lot of older ladies that were a bit out of touch. Lesson learned; next time just wait until I can make it to my regular nail salon. At least they won't overcharge me for half ass nails and no manicure.
Negative	"Tried the double fromage cheesecake here ($18.75!!!), I've never heard of this before so gave it a try, it's basically a two layer Japanese cheesecake. The top layer is a frozen, and the bottom layer is baked cheesecake. 

I thought it was a bit too icy, it was better once it got defrosted at home. The baked part was alright. Nothing special, but the price is a bit steep for a 4"" cake. Perhaps they use mascarpone which is really expensive."
Negative	If you like piss food and piss slots come here you'll love it!!! I'd rather eat mcdonalds than the slime than serve here. Worst slots I've seen and I've been in Vegas a long time. I'd burn hundred dollar bills before I spend one of them here.
Negative	Everyone who works at this post office has no god damn clue what there doing. Especially Lola who works at the pick up only window she has to be the most disrespectful, incompetent person I've met. I guess forwarding packages doesn't mean anything as they sent my package back to the seller after they told me it be forwarded. If I could give 0 stars I would.
Negative	Worst airport I've ever been to hands down. I travel the world and have been to 100+ to compare.  Only place that sucked nearly as bad was Atlanta but only because of the long walks.
Negative	"We were so excited to move into our place. The unit itself is very pretty, spacious & for the most part nicely upgraded compared to what else is out there. 

The people who run the office are extremely nice. This is nothing against them however when we first moved in everything was perfect, until they started letting trashy, ghetto people move in all in & around our building. The upsetting part is the walls are very thin, I can hear everything going on from both sides. Including partying, loud music, couples fighting, conversations & even one day I was trying to ""wake up"" went into my bathroom and stood there quietly for a moment. I was shocked that I could hear the man next door peeing in his toilet. Kinda laughable. 

My biggest issue now is, we didn't live here last summer, we moved in closer to the end of the summer when it was getting cooler outside. Not knowing we were gonna have a huge annoying problem with mosquitoes in our home. I've done everything possible, it seems like after it rains they are living in the walls some where due to stagnate water & they get in our unit. I've been bite 4 times now, every day I find at least one, if not more. 

The office basically told me that since they fly they can't do anything about it. They gave us a light to plug in that the mosquito has to fly into to die. Lol. Now what do you think the percentage of it flying into the light? Slim to none. 

We won't be resigning out lease here. For $1200 a month, we can live some where else that's more peaceful & bug free."
Negative	They are so dumb the steak and eggs breakfast that made them stand out is now $7.77. It went up $3 to $4. And it's not even all that to begin with but at the price that its definately not worth $8. Not a smart move and they must be struggling now because they went from a $0 Resort fee to an $11 Resort fee for hotels. Arizona Charlie's sucks now! Not that they were ever that good to start with
Negative	"Pretty bad place , went there and there was almost no ice cream available or fresh fruit waters 
I bought a rice pudding cup and it was awful, very hard and tasteless
Better going off the the Michoacána way better sweet treats and only 2 min away from here"
Negative	I'm from NYC so maybe it's a Vegas thing but... If you're on a line to get in and it's 4am. You don't stop said line and extort people for money to get in. That's what they do here. You have been warned. They charge more for stamp to get in faster after that
Negative	Called twice for a quote then the third time they answered and tried scheduling an appointment but they said they would return my call , they never called so I had to call them back the next day . Finally made an appointment after the fourth try, waited around for them NO CALL, NO SHOW. Lost two customers, very unprofessional.
Negative	The clothes can sell themselves, but besides that..meh. Sigh...how can I say this? The store just needs all new staff. The service is horrendous. Who is in charge of organizing the rooms because every time I walk into a room I get more and more confused? That's okay, that isn't the point. The employees are either gone with the wind or gossiping or chatting with one of their friends that come into the store. Out of every forever21 I've been to, this is BY FAR the worst. Get it together
Negative	I was desperately hungry and was in here for a corporate event so decided to sit in the bistro. The service was mostly okay but $40 for a bowl of pineapple chicken loaded with salt and close to inedible was really poor. The real killer though was $16 fgor a bottle of chilled tap water. I had two bottlers because I was so thirsty after the salty chicken. $32. I complained and it was taken off my bill after the manager argued with me about the fact that it was filtered. Terriblle
Negative	"While I was in town visiting family after my uncle just lost his battle with lung cancer my aunt and I decided to get tattoos to commemorate him. We went to Illuminati Tattoo because they had wonderful reviews on Yelp. Before I get into my tattoo I want to start off and say that Tommy was wonderful very present and did a great job on my aunts tattoo. I got mine piece done by ""Milkshake."" When he sat me down to do my tattoo he said ""don't worry this will be fast and easy."" It was fast, maybe too fast. I don't know if it's a lack of interest or just a mistake but I'm now stuck with a poorly done tattoo with jagged edges. Instead of looking down at my wrist and having something good to remember my uncle all I see is a mistake."
Negative	"Lame customer service experience.

When checking out from a mandatory work conference, I asked for a copy of my receipt at checkout (needed for expense report).

I was informed that it wasn't possible to print at the time of checkout but I was assured that it would be emailed to me that day. It wasn't.

I called the next week and was navigated into a voicemail box for accounting. I clearly gave my phone and email info in the voicemail and awaited a mandatory form that this property requires (they can't just provide a receipt? ok...)

No response back via phone or email.... I've not wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get a receipt that should have been provided at checkout. 

I left a second voicemail one week later with the same result. Nothing.

Finally, I called again and pressed ""1"" to book a room (I figured this would actually get me to a live person. It did.) I explained the situation and was finally able to get a copy of the bill. 

Overall, it's a pretty nice place, but too spread out over an enormous estate for my taste. Anytime I need a map to get from the front desk to the building where my room is.... it's a bit much. 

With the hassle of trying to get a copy of a receipt where an authorization form is required (probably handy if you're up to something shady, but annoying since I was not), I'll recommend to our events team that we checkout a Marriott property on the next national meeting."
Negative	"I used to go to this place when it was California Sushi and get the salmon teriyaki bento box for take out. I went there today and noticed that they had changed the name, and presumably the owners, but it looked the same and the menu was basically the same so I ordered. They said they didn't have salmon, so I ordered the chicken instead and it was $10 flat, while the salmon I used to get was a little over $11, so it made sense. When I went back in 15 minutes later, they had it ready for me but I noticed that it wasn't packaged up in a plastic bag with the small styrofoam cups with miso soup, rice, salad and the little plastic container with soy sauce, like they used to do. I asked her about the miso soup, rice and salad and she said that was an extra charge if I wanted it. It has always been included in the price, and especially because I used to get all that and salmon instead of chicken for only about a dollar's difference, I didn't think that was right but I took the food and left, thinking I'd just give it a chance. I was very disappointed with the food. The chicken was awful, I had to spit out half the chicken that I put in my mouth and the other half you could tell just by looking at it that it was inedible. They put the rice underneath the chicken, which I don't mind but they put only about a quarter of a cup's worth, it was such a sad amount. The gyoza was pretty good, very standard ""all you can eat"" sushi place kind of gyoza. The california rolls were okay, but they were mostly just rice and very little anything else, not to mention they didn't have any take-out packets or even little cups of soy sauce. In conclusion, I will never be back to this place. I'm very sorry to say this because I went there when it was California Sushi many, many times and it was my favourite sushi place for take-out. I can't believe they even charge $10 for the garbage I got. So disappointed with them, it makes me sad that I'll never have my favourite bento box meal ever again."
Negative	"My initial experience with Royal Furniture Gallery or the other name Furniture Mattress in Brampton was good. That's where it ended. 
3 weeks before my spouse and I purchased we went to the store just to check it out as the location on Rutherford opened 1 month before. We liked a couch and decided to take measurements and discuss how the sofa would look in the space before purchasing. 

We went back to the location 3 weeks later and picked our fabric and purchased the sofa without any alterations to the design. We were not told a delivery date but we were told our sectional will arrive in about 3 weeks as it is made to order. 

3 weeks later I received a call the sofa would be delivered. I arranged a time for delivery. My spouse arrived home before me. He told me the delivery men arrived with the wrong couch. I arrived home to see they delivered a modern couch the wrong size with metal legs lol! At least the colour was right. 

We went back to the store and spoke with the same man we purchased the couch from. He apologized and stated it was their error and it would take another 2-3 weeks to deliver our new couch. 
He advised us to keep the couch until the new couch was delivered. 

We were disappointed but we had already paid for the sofa. The following week the store called my spouse and offered him $600.00 to keep the wrong couch and go away. We declined as we wanted a more traditional look in our home. 
Our sales agent then called and explained we had to return the incorrect sofa. We made arrangements for pick up. Multiple dates and delivery men not showing up to pick up the sofa later. It was finally removed from our home.

3 weeks later I called the store for an update on the sofa. A woman answered. I requested to speak with the sales person. She stated 'he's busy'. I explained to her I was told I would receive a call and I haven't heard back. Without asking for my name or number she stated very rudely 'I'll tell him to call you' and hung up on me. I was shocked. I called back immediately and she answered. I requested she tell me who she was planning to say called. She was unable to answer. I politely gave her my name and number. I told my spouse of the incident and we decided to go to the store to obtain the status of our sofa. The woman was conveniently absent. 
We were told it was not ready and we would be notified possibly the following week. Our sales agent gave us his direct number which he rarely answered.

The following week we were finally told our delivery date and time. I was then told by my sales agent 'this has gone on too long for him'. I guess us waiting 6 weeks for our couch was very time consuming for him.
Time was to be between 5-7pm. The delivery men showed up at 9:00pm.  They had great difficulty getting the couch in the house. They did not remove the legs on the couch to make it easier to bring the sofa in the house despite my protests. I guess they were upset I was watching the delivery; one man turned to me and stated 'get me water'. I was shocked he had given me an order as opposed to asking for a glass of water. 
I gave the delivery men both glasses of water and once the couches were in they left. 
Once they left I noticed the damage to the walls and they broke the screen door. We repaired the wall and are now working on repairing/replacing the screen door."
Negative	"If I could give it less than one star I would. What used to be a pretty decent place to grab lunch has since turned to complete garbage. I got food poisoning from this dump last night. The service is complete shit and the attitude of one specific waiter is even worse (Guy with glasses you know who you are) being in the service industry myself makes the fact that this place is so horrible even more of a joke. Honestly I don't care if it never opens its doors again. Idk what happened to this once awesome places but I sure as fuck won't be coming back. 

Warning: unless you want to be sick all night and day don't go here."
Negative	"TL;DR Decent, well-priced bar food, absolutely terrible service. 

I've been here twice now, and both times the service I've received has been nothing short of terrible. The first time, my table of two was ignored for 10+ minutes after sitting down, the waitress gruffly greeted us and presented us with menus, and when we asked what was on tap, she all but rolled her eyes as she recited the list. 10+ minute wait to bring us two beers. 30+ minute wait for appetizers. And this was about 5pm on a weeknight, when the bar was maybe 1/3 full. 

I was talked into giving LOTB another shot this past weekend, since it was warm enough to sit on the patio. We walked through the restaurant, and asked if we could sit outside and the waitress didn't even turn around to address us when she pointed at the door to the patio. And then it was deja vu - 10+ minute wait for menus, 10+ minute wait for two beers - we didn't stick around for food this time, not wanting to give our patronage to a pub with such terrible service. 

The thing is, I would go back, and probably make this one my local spots. It's got a great location, great patio, solid bar food menu, decent beer selection, reasonable prices - but the serving staff is what I can only describe as apathetic, both about their customers' satisfaction and their job performance."
Negative	"I'm kind of conflicted, as there many different factors affecting this, but overall I've experienced better.

I called and made a last minute appointment for a blow out at a time close to what I was looking for (I wasn't going to complain, I was surprised to get in at all). Hours later I arrive, to a locked door, and a girl finally lets me in from the rain and asks if I'm here for a tan. When I tell her no she looks extremely confused and then can't find me in the computer, but she says we'll get started right away. 

She asks what I'm looking for and I mention the ""dilworth"" (one of the styles mentioned on the site), no glimmer of recognition in her face, so then I just say ""some volume and some curls"". As she's speeding through my hair with a fifteen second shampoo and a twenty second conditioning, I honestly start to think I'm in the wrong place. Am I going to get a call in ten minutes from another salon asking why I'm not there? The girl keeps asking me about my phone call that morning, do I know who I talked to, do I remember when I called. It's become very obvious she was ready to go home early, and I'd ruined it. But I see the wine glasses and remember the mention of wine on the site, and they carry bumble and bumble like the site I looked at... I have to be in the right place.

She uses assorted sizes of round brushes in my hair as ""curlers"" as she's drying it, and as I get up to look at it finally offers to use a curling iron... Yeah, that'd be great. So she divides my hair into five section, curls each of those, and then curls my bangs. However, she hasn't even taken the time to dry my bangs correctly, so a portion of them just don't want to cooperate, and I'm not sure she cared. She knows I'm going out that night and knows the weather, so I'm happy to hear what sounds like tons of hair spray going on my hair, cause it's gonna need it. 

As I'm checking out we discover one of the women still there took my call and accidentally put me in as a tan. Mystery solved. I pay the $35 and tip and head home, head covered. As I start preparing for the evening about 30 minutes later, I realize my hair has gone almost completely flat. I have a slight wave and my Farrah Fawcett bangs left, so I run to my own bottle of hair spray and save what I can. So much for the site's claim that the styles should last several days! 

I was happy for my curled bangs and the temporary volume, not going to lie, but for what I paid I almost wish she would have turned me away at the door."
Negative	Went to this restaurant for the lunch buffet. The place itself is big and the decor is decent. But the food is disgusting. I cannot believe ppl actually think that is what food should taste like. West Indian food is horrible and cannot even compare to East Indian food. It's a very poor, tasteless imitation.  I knew West Indian food was nasty but after going to this place it just solidified it. The buffet had very minimal options and no flavour. Would not recommend this place as you will be disappointed.
Negative	"I come here 1-2 times a week. Needless to say I AM A REGULAR! 

It never fails- yet again, another order screwed up. If it weren't for their quality of sushi I would call it quits on this place. 

A simple order: 
Avocado roll, add jalapeño 
Tuna roll
2 piece Yellow tail 
And cucumber roll

Somehow we get a cucumber and eel roll, avocado roll with roasted jalapeños, spicy tuna roll and yellowtail sashimi but 5 pieces. 

And when I come in to get it it's always a hassle to fix my order. The manager is very stoic and has zero personality. 

I'm done.

Mind you I wrote this review standing here waiting for them to make my correct order......it's now been 45 minutes and I'm still waiting."
Negative	"This is a ""mom and pop"" operation which might be fine for a restaurant, tax service, or landscaping outfit, but when your health is concerned I think you need to be more cautious.    The ""doctor's"" wife is also a part of the staff, but she is either untrained or unaware of how to behave in a professional way.  During my functional training sessions she would often encourage me to discuss my health conditions which I felt uncomfortable with because it was often in the presence of other patients which is a total violation of HIPPA  laws!  But beyond that, she also wanted to talk about my personal life and religion which also made me feel very uncomfortable.  I saw her reprimand employees in a very loud voice in the presence of many clients which I also felt was unprofessional.  

Fortunately for me, I didn't have any major injuries to overcome and didn't experience any adverse reactions to my treatments.  But the atmosphere in the office wasn't pleasant and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who values their privacy or who doesn't care to witness office politics played out in front of them.

BTW, judge for yourself whether or not Yelp is honest in its rating system. With all the negative (one star) reviews of this company, how can this business possibly have their current rating? Yelp obviously skews the results for the company. Pay special attention to the 5 star review of the person who never received any treatment, but gave five stars on a consultation. So beware!"
Negative	"It pains me greatly to provide such a low rating for a Beach(es) institution, as the location cannot be beat, the two, ya TWO sidewalk patios are amazing and the food is decent.  BUT and there is a definite BUT, the owner is a tyrant.  I have personally witnessed him berate staff in plain view of his customer base on several occasions, and have had to suffer uncomfortably as this same staff attempted to make futile attempts on his behalf for this truly abhorrent behaviour.

The staff seem nervous and unsure of themselves, constantly looking over their shoulders to ensure that they aren't committing some perceived slight.  I cannot say that I blame them, as the majority of staff here are friendly, professional and courteous, it's obviously not an issue with the staff, but with the owner himself.

This in turn translates into sporadic service and at times a toxic environment.  Not what one expects in such pub."
Negative	"SCAM!! We saw a few pictures of the minced beef with rice on Yelp and it wasn't on the menu so we asked the waiter if it were possible to make this for us. They ended charging us $20 for the dish and the average price of all their rice and noodles dishes is $15 so we thought that was very suspicious. I didn't think to look at the menu prices on Yelp at the time but I just looked and the minced beef rice was $12.50. Menu prices have probably changed a little by then...but not $20. RIDICULOUS!!!!! 

Moving along.. We got our check and paid. They never gave us our change. It was so hard to get their attention because they kept avoiding our table and looking away. Finally we flagged someone down and asked for our change. They assumed the change was tip. Ok a restaurant should never assume the change is tip. You can't just keep a customer's change without asking. And we didn't even leave enough for it to be considered tip.... Anyway we were very upset because the service was just really bad. We got our change and left a tip that we felt reflected the service. As we were walking out, the waiter ran to us and told us that they don't need our change and handed us back the tip. I think this speaks for itself....."
Negative	"The worst haircut I've ever gotten. When I asked to get it corrected I got an appointment with an apprentice instead with a stylist. Additionally I need to pay for it. They have a corrections policy to help you schedule a complimentary appointment with your original stylist or another stylist at the same experience level at no charge. I suppose they are too busy with other clients, so they care as long as you paying. 

Disappointed"
Negative	"WORST HOT AND SOUR SOUP EVER.  
I complained and they said they would make me more soup.
Just like yesterday, they made a big batch, heated some for me and put in vegetables and meats.
They raised the price to $4.00, the quality decreased to horrible.  I won't go back there.
When I told them I wanted a fresh batch, they said we just made this.ars.
I will not go back to this hole in the wall dump.
See my other one-star review about this dive."
Negative	"Have rented the SAME EXACT costume from them for my son's school presentations two years in a row.  Last year, it was $30 for the rental and this year (almost same costume except I received boots) was $70.  It is hard to determine why the price difference.  They are good about letting you have some time with the costumes.  When you need a costume (not during Halloween), this is the place where you can get it, but you will pay for it.

I am sure I can come up with the receipts showing the different prices and I won't be bullied into taking this review down."
Negative	My neighbor blasted his tv  all night long, so I'm already in a bad mood.  I decided to stop fighting it and get up to bathe.   There is no plug for the the drain.  I went to the front desk and she said she had no way of getting one she's alone.  I asked if I could get one from an empty room.  Then I was told they don't have any.  Who doesn't have a drain plug really!    Everything in the room was fine, besides the lack of a plug and the two pubic hairs I found on the toilet seat.
Negative	"The food was good. The service was absolutely horrible. My brother, fiancé and myself decided to try this branch because the other ones we had ate at previously were great all the way around. 
When we first walked in, there was 3 young girls (hostesses) huddled together at their booth. They didn't welcome us or offer seating. We had to ask if we could sit at the bar. Once we sat at the bar we waited about 5 minutes, the bartenders never even acknowledged us. At this point, my brother walked up to the hostess booth, and asked if we could be seated outside, once seated we sat for another 10 minutes. Again we weren't acknowledged, our waitress walked passed us about 5 times, and finally we decided to start timing how long it would take to be noticed. 10 minutes.. so, that's 20 minutes outside, waiting. My fiancé finally got back up and walked to the hostess booth again and asked if we could be served, at that point we were promptly attended too. But, I am assuming that is only because a manager was standing there as well. I had even asked a couple sitting next to us how long they had waited to be acknowledged, and they said that they also had to get up and ask to be served. It's safe to say that we will never come back to this location again. And clearly, this location needs to focus on hiring more capable staff, or maybe even focus on more efficient training."
Negative	"Fancy place with great decor and unprofessional staff. I'm sorry when taking a group picture for customers don't tell them to ""show some love"". No. Came here for dessert with some other elites- the menu was minimal, I ordered an apple crumble pie with vanilla ice cream to share ended up being oatmeal and apples. Really not worth the 8$! However, given it was last call and late night -tiredness hits everyone-im open to  giving this place another try during operating hours."
Negative	"Great location, good selection of inventory - but as for honesty, transparency and doing the right thing this place is terrible. 

My wife and I stopped in to browse this past Saturday and Douglas came out to greet us. I told him what we were looking for a class C in the range of $40-65k something that will hold value so that we could trade it in in a couple years on a used diesel pusher. 

He tells us that they just got in a 2008 Diesel Pusher that still needed detailed it was pretty dirty and needs some repairs - but that they had priced it at $47,999. 

We went and took a look and it was exactly what we were looking for! Sold. Ah not so fast. 

We go in do all the credit stuff, work out all the deal points. So we are hanging out waiting on paperwork and the manager comes in, sits us down and tells us that they made a mistake. 

Derrick the manager claims that they transfixed the numbers on the unit - it isn't $47,999 but $74,999 and that the unit being it had been in inventory for 192 days was suppose to be reduced to $72,999. He apologized and asked us if we would like to proceed with the purchase at the list price - $72,999!!!

As you can imagine we were pissed. Seriously I just wasted 2 hours of my time, did all the paperwork and they wait till the last minute to tell us they screwed up. 

I get it people are human they make mistakes - but I wanted that coach. So you offer it to me at retail. You screwed up, it was a mistake I get it. I wouldn't expect them to lose $25k but they could have made a reasonable counter. ""Sorry guys we screwed the pooch. Here is what the book on the coach is - we were going to price it at $72k but if you still want it we will do it at $65k plus give you a warranty and free oil changes for a year"". Anything. But nope take it or leave it.

As we were leaving I realized something. The coach was dirty, needed a bit of body work and some minor repairs - heck it just came on the lot and they hadn't had a chance to detail it or repair it yet ......... but remember Derrick the manager told me that the unit was in inventory for 192 days. I went back into the dealership and confronted him. His story is that it did just come in but was in wholesale for the past 7 months in Davis. YEAH right. 

Buyer beware!"
Negative	Macayos used to be a go to favorite but with ask the menu changes it tastes they are raising the prices and lowering the quality of food, the service has never been great,  probably will choose a different mexican restaurant from now on:/
Negative	Awful service. Workers could barely speak English and I had to repeat my order at least 5 times until they understood me and it took two people to take my order. It cost me $18 for two small sandwich combos. I will not be going back.
Negative	Below average Chipotle. Chips were stale, portions where small, staff was nice though. Ordered a burrito and the girl used a ripped tortilla. When she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one. Slightly disappointed. I'm not expecting fine dining, but would at least like it to be comparable to other visits.
Negative	Might be a good place. Who knows. It was closed during hours posted that is would be open. Had been planning on going for days during a trip to Montreal. Finally made our way over in the cold. Go to a more reliable place so as not to waste your vacation time.
Negative	"Any savings realized at the counter were quickly flushed down the toilet when the ink cartridges began to ""expire"" with ink still in them.  Some of the ink cartridges I bought here are still almost full, one was completely full.  This is just as much a gripe about HP and their ink supply scam as much as it is the stores who reload and resell these soon to expire cartridges.  I will not buy ink here or from any place that refills cartridges again."
Negative	"Customers beware that the Turtle Creek location is not worth your time and energy. The people who own this location are rude to nice people. I completely understand now why they were trying to promote this location on Restaurant.com because they have to be losing business due to their horrible manners. My boyfriend and I drove there from Monroeville because we had a $10 gift certificate especially for this location. We walked in, tried to order and redeem this gift certificate. The man coldly responded ""I am not taking that, go get your money back"". It is a shame that we welcome people from other countries to come here for the american dream to open small businesses and some are so extremely rude, ungrateful, and contemptuous towards their American customers. I really cannot think of any other reason that they would have been so rude. My boyfriend and myself are friendly and polite. We feel for people in the service industry and treat them with respect. As paying customers, I expect the same in return."
Negative	"We were there for dinner on a Friday night.  It doesn't seem too busy.  We had waited at least 15 minutes before being seated.  The staffs were friendly especially if you're Korean, which we're not. .  The side dishes were small.   The foods took too long to be served. They had never asked if we wanted water.  Tea was served, but no refills.  

Price: High
Food: Average, but had better Korean food
Service: Average"
Negative	I was really looking forward to eating here.  I was sorely disappointed by the quality, flavour, and quantity of meat they put in the burritos.  Just another knock-off Tex Mex place.
Negative	"Chipotle is the most over hyped crap I have ever eaten.  First of all it is terrible for you, most people have no idea how many calories they are actually consuming.

This location when I visited had the filthiest dining room.  Would it kill you to get one of your peeps to sweep the floor and clean off tables?  Do I really have to sit in a chair covered in guacamole knee deep in broken corn chips?

The food is meh.  There is nothing special about it.  Stop about 200 feet before Chipotle and get yourself Chik-fil-a to eat."
Negative	"We are very DISAPPOINTED w/our experience! First off, we were so excited purchasing VIP seats (Row GA to be exact) to take our 4 year old son only to be sat in the middle back row and explained by the RUDE seating lady that every seat is considered ""VIP"" and we're lucky she's not seating us all the way in the back. We couldn't believe she was talking to us like this?!?! Also, that the front rows are only for people 6 years and older.  We let that go because our son was visibly disappointed and getting upset. Secondly, it is definitely much more an adult show than we thought from reading the reviews. We thought this was going to be a family friendly show for children but there were sexual content w/jokes about ""penetration"" and Mac King was pulling hidden objects from his crotch and then trying to make audience members eat them (like his constant fig newtons that kept showing up during the show). Lots of sexual innuendos that my husband and I found inappropriate and disappointing as our son was hearing and watching all this. We couldn't even see the goldfish during the goldfish trick from our seats. Lastly, Mac King asked 2 kids where they are from and how old and they were 4 & 5 years old! So basically the RUDE seating lady was not only RUDE but she LIED to us saying that the front section that we purchased was only 6 year old and over! We have never been so insulted and disappointed in a show. We go to shows every other month, and thIs was the absolute WORST! We would highly advise not seeing this show unless you want to get ripped off and have your children listening to jokes w/sexual content and sexual innuendos!!!! FAIL!!!"
Negative	"If I could give less then a star, i would. Let me start out by saying I downloaded this app specifically to write this review. That should be pretty descriptive of my experience at gentle dental( formerly southwest) which I'm also sure they had to change their name, because of the large amount of complaints they receive. They will take your money, and say you need things you don't, and tell you they're doing a courtesy for you. A courtesy? Yes it was very sweet of them to take advantage of a situation. I had a crown done by them, it fell out two months later, and when you call to complain from what another dentist is telling you that's ""their opinion"". IT IS NOT AN OPINION WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD IT FROM TWO OTHER DENTIST. The staff is rude, and vastly unprofessional, the front desk girl in the general dentistry always seems like she has just taken a full bottle of prescription medicine. Her eyes are low and she's incompetent, loosing my paperwork, and having me sit in the waiting room for hours. The location itself is trash, and their patients tend to be people who don't have the money to pay for things they need at a good dentistry so they come here, and get taken advantage of. The main problem is the general dentistry. The orthodontist should really be somewhere else. They are the shinning star of that gross establishment. I was also yelled at by an employee over the phone, and told that I could come in for more work??? Why would I want to get butchered some more? You can see all the other reviews and know that I'm not exaggerating when I say they are the worst dentist in Arizona. They need to be shut down. I hope that the next person who considers going here reads this review, and saves themselves months of headaches."
Negative	"I am a huge burger fan and, frankly, Lush Burger was a enormous dissappointment.  

My friend and I ordered the classic burger with the 50/50 combo of sweet potato and regular fries.  

As for the burger... To start, the bun was hard, cold, and dry.  The meat was also dry, flavorless, overcooked, and significantly under-seasoned.   I had to salt my burger at the table and coat it with ketchup to make up for the dryness and lack of flavor.  Also, the meat was extremely dense and tough, as if it had been over-worked when shaped into a patty.   

As for the fries, they were cold, soggy, and also underseasoned.  I am not sure they were salted at all before showing up at our table.  

Overall, the only thing this place has going for it is a trendy decore.  If you want a great, beefy burger, try The Grind in Phoenix, or you can also try the ""ground to order"" sirloin burger at La Grande Orange.  Heck... just go to your local In and Out.  Any of these options are far superior to the bland mediocre fare at Lush."
Negative	The club is TINY. The music on Sunday 3/27/16 was terrible. I'm glad we didn't pay to get in. We were in and out in less than 1 hour. I won't be going back.
Negative	I wanted so much to love this place but alas we did not. We went for lunch and the food was so so, a bit pricey even for the strip, and the outside deck wasnt even open. Not bad but not great. 2.5 stars.
Negative	First time going and very disappointed. Got in quickly. Waitress was quick with placing the order and very friendly but we waited for our food for about 45 min. Looked good but didn't taste good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were so hard and not eatable. Gravy was ok. Ordered a chocolate latte and charged $1.50 for the chocolate on top of the latte price $3.29. Walked out very disappointed. Never going back.
Negative	Made the mistake of ordering a set of wheels for my 1973 Winnebago from here. The price seemed high at $1100 for a set of used rims, but they were hard to find five lug wheels and I didn't have time to drive around to junkyards in my area. My initial order was on May 23. They charged my credit card on May 25th and said the wheels would be shipped in a couple of days. I contacted them a few times over the next month and the wheels still hadn't shipped. The mechanic that had my RV couldn't wait any longer and said he'd have to start charging me storage if I didn't get it out of there ASAP, so I had to cut my losses and give the RV away. I contacted them to cancel the order on June 22nd and they said that UPS had them, but they hadn't shipped. They asked if I still wanted to cancel and I told them once again to cancel the order and refund my credit card. After that they stopped responding and didn't refund my credit card, so I had to file a dispute with Visa.
Negative	There's too many bad things to name in just one review. The place is a sh*t show. From coitus in their pools to constant dirt and leaves being blown directly onto your brand new car from the careless landscaping people, this was a very unfortunate choice for my boyfriend and I and his 3 year old daughter. I would not recommend this complex to anyone unless you are willing to deal with constant disappointment and unhelpful lobby staff. I don't expect much from apartment receptionists, but I do expect them to be respectful to us renters who are paying way more than this dump is worth. Good luck to any of you who still decide to go with Genoa Lakes. Maybe they'll get their act together some day.
Negative	Just a terrible place. Nice on the surface, but the staff are liars and the place is really just ghetto. I'd drive on by, there is so much better out there.
Negative	"I'm a health-conscious and open-minded omnivore with a vegetarian partner, so I've tried a lot of different vegetarian and vegan versions of things and been able to compare them with ""the real thing"". Sometimes they closely imitate the real thing. Sometimes they don't compare, but are still tasty. And sometimes they're a failure on the scale of Aux Vivre's veggie butter, which I think they must have really worked on to make sure it resembled actual butter in no way whatsoever. If you've ever wondered what corn bread would taste like with Asian salad dressing, Aux Vivres is for you!

Aux Vivres makes to-go food that can be found in local groceries and markets. I recently picked up the BBQ Tempeh wrap, because I'd never had BBQ tempeh I didn't love, at least until that day. Would recommend this wrap for anyone who finds tofu just too flavourful. If I had to rate this tempeh's flavour on a scale of 1-5 where 5 is a plain hard-boiled egg and 1 is the tap water at my mom's house, I might give it a 0.75.

Aux Vivres makes what my partner calls ""California hippy vegan"" food, the hallmarks of which are a fetishization of certain ""superfoods"", the vege bait-and-switch (it's just like regular butter, in the sense that both are yellow!), and a focus on the foods' health benefits at the expense of rich, full-bodied flavour. Definitely come here if you are looking for an interesting salad to Instagram, not so much if you're after comfort food.

The redeeming quality that gave this review the extra star is Aux Vivre's Dragon Bowl, specifically Dragon Sauce, of which you can get a bottle to take home. Whatever Dragon Sauce is, it is delicious, and tastes vastly more like butter than whatever's in their veggie butter."
Negative	This place WAS really good... fresh ingredients, very tasty, perfectly cooked.  The last time though, I was disappointed.  I'm not completely sure, however it seemed like the pizzas were smaller, my crust was burnt and the toppings were much more scarce.  If it was a fluke, better controls need to be in place for quality.  I've seen other popular places go downhill & get lazy with the quality.  Not sure I'll be back again.
Negative	"Have not been here in years AND WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!, After reading the other reviews it seems as though nothing has changed.  I still remember the visit here vividly as it was the worst experience i have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life!
I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry.
We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice.
About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting ""why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait"" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!! He said the host who takes the checks wouldn't budge and said how does he know its not our fault and we keeping the food anyways even though we said we didn't want it he said ok we still made food if u keep or throw away u still have to pay! Unbelievable!!! If you want to experience a nightmare go here! Not saying your experience will be as horrendous as mine , but just thought I'd share my dining out nightmare here as I can see I'm not alone In this. 
Yelp should have a ""worst restaurant poll"" guarantee this will come up! Shut harbor palace down!!!"
Negative	By far the worst customer service ever!! I came in and this one guy was just rude and very unhelpful, I asked if he can install a windshield wiper for me and he said no take it to your mechanic, I didn't argue about it so I just said okay and left... But I will never be back there ever again!! It's not about him not helping me it's just the way it was handled, it could've been a little more nicer.
Negative	Sitting in waiting room right now ... soo sick didn't take time to read reviews before I did online check in... did online checkin and still been sitting  here about to pass out for over an hour and a 1/2 there were only 3 people ahead of me and 2 people that came in after me left already due to long wait ... the fast part is a joke ... and Blanca at the front desk just makes excuses and tells you ... we are really fast but .... blah blah blah excuses why it's been so long ... compassion for their patients is non existent
Negative	Don't order the Salmon. Our dream anniversary was destroyed by food poisoning from a salmon crepe. I was sick for four days. Called the manger but she never returned our call. They didn't seem to care at all. Run away. We noticed they handle the fish and then put hands directly into topping bowls without changing gloves. Ugh
Negative	If you're a gay couple wishing to spend a good night at an open minded place on Valentine's day in Montreal, don't go to Toqué. The front desk staff gave us a really annoying look when my wife and I entered the restaurant. It totally spoiled my experience. We didn't expect a $400 meal experience to start with a judgy look like this. The waiter was very friendly though. I don't recommend this place.
Negative	Over-rated !   Very disappointed with the service at Strip. For the amount of money spent, our experience was horrible. Slow wait staff, no attention to detail, had to ask for bread twice, took 20 mins to receive our cocktails, warm bottle of beer, manager bought second drink, comped a dessert to go, had to put a different server on our table... they knew they screwed up.... the list goes on and on and on. Never again and will make sure to let everyone know......Taking our business to RED !
Negative	"I go to a lot of sushi places, so this place was really expensive for the quality, and the pressed/torched sushi was so disappointing - barely any flavour and cold. It wasn't well pressed either, the rice kept breaking in half once I dabbed it into the soy sauce.  

The spicy salmon roll was good for the price - I believe $8. 

The Tuna (6 pcs in 3 types, 2 ways, I believe) that was $32 was really good - only thing that was notable from my experience there.

I wouldn't go back there. Overrated place, in my opinion."
Negative	"The food is pretty good, but do not order from here unless you want your food to be totally wrong when it's delievered. This has happened to me 5 out of the 8 times I have order from here within the year.

Probably won't order from here again."
Negative	"Pretty much everything about this place is awful. I stay on the strip a lot and this is my first time here. Let's star with how crappy this place is:

1) Cable is constantly pixelated and watching TV isn't possible unless you want to watch a constantly stuttering show.

2) The worst internet ever, practically non-existent. The few times I could contact in the room page loads were so slow it took minutes to load a simple web page. I called several times and they couldn't fix, speed test was .08 Mbps. Finally they moved me to a so called ""Internet Room"" which supposedly had a router in it. It worked in the new room but was still very slow, speed test was about .4 Mbps. Barely passable to do basic web browsing. Apparently they are aware that there internet sucks here and have special rooms set aside for people that complain about it. Cable TV was even more pixelated in this room.

3) 5-10 min wait times whenever I call the Front Desk.

4) 5 min wait time when I called Room Service. Then they tell me they can't give me what I wanted because there supposed 24 hour kitchen isn't all working. Then they tell me I can't put it on my room because there systems are down. Then they call back 15 min later and say what I ordered also isn't available. I Finally told them to cancel the whole damn order.

There's probably more bad stuff that I can't recall at the moment.

What was good about it:

1) Checking out and getting the hell out of there and never coming back."
Negative	"Total Real Estate stole $80 from me. When it came time to return all the keys and garage door openers that were given to us, they were less than accommodating. I returned all keys and garage clickers on time. When I received my security deposit back, they tried charging me for $120 of items that I had originally listed in the conditions report. They said they would refund me on $40. The other $80 was for a garage door clicker they say didn't work. I know that to be untrue. I tested all keys and garage clickers the day I returned them. They also charged me $140 for cleaning even though I had a maid come and clean the whole house, taking four hours. Total RE was less than helpful and refused to reimburse me. Steve the property manager gave me no explanation, just "" not sure what else can be done."" The company has handled this very poorly and I would never recommend them. Stay away if you are looking for an honest company."
Negative	"This is really a 2.5 Rating (If I could issue one)

Yes the food is good here. When I've been here in the past though, the service has been spotty. Long wait times and mistaken orders has eroded what the food does so well to balance out the experience.

Is the food revolutionary? Not really but it is done well here. I just don't find myself sitting when I'm hungry and Hanna's rising to the top of my list to eat. It's good, not great and it'll do in a pinch."
Negative	"The website allows you to book a reservation yet it does not allow you to confirm the price upon checkout.  Omni, it is not best practice to ask for your clients credit card information without informing them of the quote/price they are agreeing to upon the ""Confirm"" page.  Please change.  Also, when I tried to call in to make a reservation I was greeting with a ""PLEASE HOLD"" in what sounded like one of Marge Simpson's sister's voice.  My call was then picked up, transferred and finally dropped.  This is why you did not get my business today.  I sincerely hope this feedback helps you improve your business."
Negative	Really wish I could break my lease.. Paying over $1000 for a one bedroom apartment isn't going to cut it.. If the grounds were nicer like when Camden owned the property sure. I was paying $1000 for a one bedroom while Camden owned the property and didn't mind.. NOW I DO. This really isn't worth it anymore.. If I had the funds, I'd be out tomorrow..
Negative	"Soju is a new and upcoming Korean restaurant in Bloomfield that is highly overrated. Me and my group of friends were craving authentic and well-made Korean food and we saw this place open up and decided to go.

The first impressions of this store were promising - the decor was contemporary and waitresses friendly. However, we were given A4 paper menus with a limited selection of choices. I ordered the bibimbap for 18 dollars (it was 14 dollars + 4 dollars for beef which I thought was absurd and reflects a poor pricing strategy). The food itself was pretty good, I would argue a little too sweet but given the target audience it makes sense, but absolutely not worth the price of nearly 20 dollars. The bibimbap also comes with no side dishes, a necessary practice in Korean cuisine.

TLDR: service and ambience is good, food is decent, but definitely not worth the price. Would not come again."
Negative	Fight night and they are seating family style which is fine, but when we get 2 different rounds of people and the 3 girls in the booth next to us that the manager keeps flirting with get none it's super annoying.
Negative	I contracted Movers of the Valley to move a 2 bedroom house about 2 miles- which took them 5 hours. They advertise that they only hire professional movers- which is why I picked them. I have very nice furniture and wanted them to be moved carefully. However- they ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL movers. One on the men that showed up was an electrician that was recently laid off and looking for work. My couches were DESTROYED in the move. They were leather sofas that were less than 2 years old and in mint condition. They also busted a corner off of an armoire. As soon as they unwrapped the couches and I saw the damage I insisted we call their office. Of course no one was available. I made sure to write on the receipt that there was damage so that if they decided to play games- as they are- I would have written proof. I called their office that Monday and was told to email pictures- which I did. No one called. Later that week I called again- I was told the lady who was handling it was out. I left a message. No return call. The following week I called again- not available and no return call. Obviously they are not wanting to address the issues of the damage they caused.
Negative	"We were so excited to possibly work with Robco after seeing all the great reviews here on Yelp and on Google. We just purchased this home, are not in a rush to get panels, and have already received other quotes. Long story short, we are not going with this company due to poor customer service despite hearing great things about them from other customers and solar companies. The first lady we worked with failed to show up to the appointment anywhere near on time, and the second person we worked with apologized that she dropped the ball but proceeded to drop the ball once again. It should not be this difficult to receive a quote, and I don't even want to imagine how much more difficult it could be to deal with them if we went ahead with solar panels and ever had issues.

So we requested a quote from Robco through Yelp, got a call from Krystal to schedule the appointment, and then set the appointment for the upcoming week at the only time that we had available on our busy schedules. We didn't receive an appointment confirmation. Appointment day came, we didn't get any calls to confirm our appointment, we showed up at the house 30 minutes before the appointment time in case they came early, and 15 minutes after the appointment was supposed to have begun, we got a call from her saying she was 40 minutes away and if that was okay. It wasn't and this was what we were hoping to avoid when we scheduled an appointment. So we had to cancel and she said she'd email us the quote instead which made us wonder why she didn't say she could do that before because that would have saved us all time. An hour or so later, we got an email from her that said the solar proposal is attached, but there was nothing attached to the email. Disappointing.

Giving her the benefit of the doubt, and maybe her schedule was crazy although that is not our responsibility and she could have easily given us a call or text or email before 6 to let us know she would be late, I decided to try contacting them the next morning. I called, spoke with a man on the phone and let him know the situation and he let me know that there was no record of us in the system at all. STRANGE... so he asked for our information again, I gave it to him, and he said someone would call me or email me and get in touch with me. I am writing this review 2 days later and have received no correspondences whatsoever and we have decided to move forward with other companies. 

We shouldn't have to try this hard to get a quote from a company, and have not had to try so hard with any other company. It's unfortunate but due to this experience, we will not be doing business with them or recommending them - despite having heard great things from people and other solar companies about them."
Negative	Got quoted $70 for a vehicle lockout, haggled him down to $55 so they obviously overcharge and can drop it down. He said 20-25 minutes and then almost an hour later the driver calls and says he's 15 minutes away from a completely different address and he would need more time to get to me. Wasted an hour with these guys then had Eagle Locksmith here in 15 min for $45.
Negative	"You know what? I really like the pizza here. I do. I decided I would like to take 2 of my kids here for dinner tonight because they haven't been here. The like the pizza also by the way.  I don't like ordering a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and never have my server visit again. Well, sort of. The first time after we all ran out of drinks, after she walked by 5 times and wouldn't make eye contact, I asked another server if my kids could get refills and another beer for me. She of course did promptly and our server dropped my beer off with hardly a comment. After I wanted the pizza boxed up and my kids wanted a dessert the manager actually noticed us trying to get her attention to no avail and helped us. I know the servers work hard and I don't like to give bad tips or complain but damn, a simple "" Sorry I have to cover the patio too"" would have went a LOONG way. I know she did because I watched her walk by us out there i dunno... 20 times maybe? I've probably been there 15-20 times but I'll be hard pressed to go again I guess. Ehh... I'm sure I'll go again but damn!"
Negative	OMG. garbage B.S. trash, Or maybe Im just getting old.  Horrible accoustics as the other shows music going on next door and upstairs drowns out the whole dialouge of the show.. Got the tickets free and hated it at that price. 2 of my guests fell promptly asleep. Some of the young kids sitting next to me were cracking up laughing though.   Pls. close down asap.
Negative	"I swear I must have died sometime last weekend because when I came here to eat this weekend I was treated like a ghost despite standing right next to the two hostesses. Your food has good reviews but unfortunately I fear that I would have to jump through hoops and eat fire just to get serviced. HOW CAN YOU FEED THE PEOPLE WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN SERVE THE FOOD. 

Locals FAIL!"
Negative	"I have had such great hopes for the Green Beanery. 

They always manage to disappoint. 

I live down the street from the Bloor and Bathurst store, and have gone there quite a bit for espresso coffee drinks, snacks and roasted coffee beans. I started ordering my coffee from the Green Beanery too.

They have many of the elements of my ideal coffee place: good selection of fair trade beans, the option of getting your selected roasts, and coffee equipment that is hard to find at other places. 

However, the most generous description of their service I can think of is ""random"". It is confusing in layout, inconsistent and indifferent. 

When I make a custom roast order, the consistency is horrible. I always order medium roast (what they call ""city roast"") and it ends up being anywhere from light to very dark.

In short, they need a manager that cares about service and coffee. After two years of going there on a regular basis, I am pretty sure that nobody is in charge, or the person who is doesn't care about service."
Negative	"Just a little disclaimer for everyone wanting to go here for some chocolate ice cream or any other flavor...... they don't have any.... they have Vanilla ice cream with a tiny swirl of chocolate, raspberry, or any flavor you choose and don't tell you this, they sell it as ""chocolate ice cream"" and then you get vanilla:(........ however the crépes are good, a little too much chocolate but they're good!"
Negative	"what to say?...  So we arrive and after waiting for an hour to check in we are told that we are going to be charged an additional $450 for incidentals for our stay, then we were told that it was just a hold, then we were told that since we prepaid over the amount for the rooms at booking there were to be no charges.  He did need my credit card for verification, which he immediately charged the $450 to which I didn't know until checking my account.
Then upon arrival to our room we noticed housekeeping pulled a splash and dash, and nothing was really clean.  Our terrace had the remnants of a broken glass and some kind of juice stain all over it.  We called 4 times to have housekeeping come out, and they never did.  Even on the daily housekeeping routines they never checked the terrace and never ran a vacuum.  Throughout our stay we also noticed things like chip crumbles in the hallway for 2 days, a water bottle on the floor in the ice room for our whole stay and numerous other things that fell back on housekeeping.  For a hotel this nice I would hope for some cleanliness!
I never heard one story or saw anyone win anything on the casino floor.  The bars where cool, the breakfast at the buffet was good (way better than buffet food!), the restaurants and shops all were great.

Now I am back home and checking my accounts and I see they charged me an extra $200.  Just a one time charge of $200 3 days after my stay.  I would have checked my itemized receipt that I was promised in email at check out but I haven't received it.  I can only assume it is for the broken glass and stain on the terrace that was there when we arrived but who knows...  I have tried to contact them 4 times today and whoever the operator tries to put me through to the phone just rings until it goes to a busy signal and hangs up.

Oh and the stupid tv control thing, yeah its a pretty neat idea to have all of your room controls on your tv, but the thing had to be reset constantly just to function as a tv.  Then when we tried to order a movie one late night and it didn't work the tech noticed that I was never properly logged into the system.  He called the front desk and had them log me off and then back in.  But they all forgot to tell me that after that my keycards wouldn't work anymore.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying here.  The service is slow or non existent, check-in is not only slow but charged me unnecessarily, compared to other casino hotels we have stayed at the cosmo is expensive, a tad rude, dirty, and in general not worth the hype."
Negative	Worst sprint store I have ever been to. I only give this store one star because i have to. I went in to have my phone number switched from a business account to a normal account (something I feel is very simple to do). After waiting for 2 hours, they informed me that I would have to go to a corporate store in order to get my line switched. Not to mention, while the sales rep was working with me, he constantly kept leaving to go and talk with other customers and write other people's names down on the sign in sheet. It would be nice to have undivided attention when I am trying to get a problem solved. It also would have been very nice to have been told the minute that I walked in the door that I would have to go to another store - instead of wasting 2 hours of my day. I will not return to this store ever again.
Negative	We went there hoping to get a late night dessert at 11:00pm. When we walked in, they said they were closed when the sign clearly said it closed at midnight. Thanks for nothing.
Negative	"I work not too far from here and for the lack of decent, non fast food places around, you'd think this place would be booming. It's not. I've been here and had ""decent"" food - not great but ok. But in the heart of the lunch hour, the two of us were the only ones in the place. I've driven by dozens of times at lunch and see no cars in their lot. I'm struggling to figure out why since it's in ""downtown"" Springdale. You'd think that by default they'd get people who ""stumbled"" in. The menu is basic, the service was ok, the food tasted no worse than other places I've been, but I just can't bring myself to go back. It's one of those places that gave me an odd feeling. That's not what I'm looking for."
Negative	"If i could give him zero stars i would. This has has to be one of the worst doctors I have ever encountered!!! The doctor is only willing to help you if your ""attractive"" as I see.patient after patient the more attractive you are the more time you get! He forces his mentally ill patients to write him a good review before he will even hand them the medication he has prescribed. I have been seeing him for six months and only because I am unable to get into a real doctor. He has been short with me every single visit, he speaks over me, he doesn't listen and treats his staff terrible. This man is the worst kind of chauvinist. I feel sorry for the lady who runs the office she is the one exception to the experience. I watch her treat each person as if they are family(if she was the doctor I would stay)unfortunately she works for a dirt bag so her hard work I am sure goes unnoticed. Final straw was being put into a room with a man(the VP a man of course!! good old boys club) who i have never even seen in the office the last 6 months i have been here and asked to sit with him and write a good review as he watched!!!!As soon as I find a new doctor I am gone(thank God my medication a has been the same since I was a teen)worst experience with any doctor I have ever had."
Negative	Just ate here, food was ok, not as good as Las Vegas blvd location, tipped 9 bucks anyways, I asked the guy for a refill on my small iced tea, he wanted to charge me two bucks. Never mind.  I'll go somewhere else next time.
Negative	"I was not impressed with the service here.  The moment that we got inside there were employees eating at one of the hibachi table near the kitchen. I am allergic to shellfish and informed the waitress and ask them to cook it shrimp appetizers last.  When the chef came out the shrimp was on the same tray as the steak and chicken.  They cross contained all the steak and chicken with shrimp by not cooking it last.  While we were waiting on out food to be cooked the hostess had a bunch of their friends up there just chit chatting.  Near the end of our meal we noticed a hibachi chef in the back on his phone with his feet propped up on the others while on his cell phone.  
When we told the waitress about my food allergy, she didn't take it seriously.  I could of died from the cross contamination of the shellfish. People should be more aware of the seriousness of food allergy.   
We noticed that after the hibachi chef cleaned the grill it was still dirty. Notice the other hibachi grills had food still on them where there were no customer at them. 
The waitress never even came back to check on his. Not even ONCE to refill out drinks. 
This is our FIRST and LAST time going here unfortunately! There are a few far and between hibachi place here."
Negative	I travel for business & am a Marriott lifetime Platinum, so stayed in Cosmo, rather than Venetian where my event was held. My first night, in in  $329 + $35 resort fee per night room the AC was out. I ended up trying to sleep that night with my balcony door open to cool the room, meaning I didn't sleep at all. With limited room to write the whole story I'll simply say the entire process drug out till the next afternoon, when they finally changed our room. When I spoke to guest services I expected them to at least offer to comp something for my trouble. They didn't even offer to comp that night (I am staying 4) or the resort fees. Guest Services Rebecca actually tried to make me feel like I was trying to get over on them for asking. It's a company expensed trip, so it's not out of my pocket. Go elsewhere on the strip
Negative	"Terrible Customer Service - be careful signing up for their monthly pass. Once they have your credit card, they make it impossible to cancel!!! I tried on-line and even called their corporate office. 

After being told that the pass would be cancelled, they charged my card again!! When I asked to speak to a Supervisor, the attendant told me that I would be told the same thing and refused to connect me to a supervisor!!"
Negative	Here is the deal.... I have been coming to this hotel for about 3 years  to celebrate my daughters birthday who has Autism and let me tell you this is the last time!!!!! So I never thought I would be that customer but I can't! I checked in and the lobby just smells like a cheap motel full of smoke! Then I get to my room and sit on my bed and what do I find but a short and curly black pubic hair! Omg I'm absolutely disgusted so I call the Mgr in charge and he is like oh I'll connect you to house keeping.. Fine they come up and yes I'm not a A..hole I tip them $20.00 for doing there job then that night I call and ask can I please have hot water and a cup so my special needs daughter can take her night time medicine well they are like ya that's usually a fee and I told them I understand and would tip them well but really this hotel is a mess I will never stay here again!!! Oh Mr. Wynn how you talk about your hotel!
Negative	i have been to this location several times but have yet to have a decent experience.. i went in to have them transfer my old phone info to my new device that i received in the mail.. when i arrived they couldn't figure out why they were not able to transfer all the info. but that isn't what bothers me, what bothers me is after the young lady who was helping me couldn't figure it out, she told me she was off and had to leave.... and then she went and helped another customer waiting. i then literally stood at the front desk and was ignored for 45 minutes while the girl who was originally helping me did all she could to not make eye contact with me. i Will never go back
Negative	"So, its Labor Day, and it just so happens to be my mom's birthday.

I have been here before and had a good experience and tasty food but she had never been.


She was talking about going about a week ago and so I called today just to make sure they were open.

The girl who answered the phone was so rude. She answered the phone ""HELLO!"" Shouting into the phone and I said ""Hi, I am trying to reach Skinnyfats."" She goes ""UGH THIS IS SKINNYFATS!"" I apologized and asked if they were open today. She told me NO!

We drove by and they were MOST DEFINITELY OPEN. I was so disappointed. I tried to contact a manager and kept getting hung up on.

I won't ever be back and if anyone asks, I will let them know what happened to me on my mothers birthday!"
Negative	Their food was mediocre at best, and that is, if you receive it. They take over 30 min per dish which is even worse considering that they give you a time limit, for the buffet, before charging you again. They got our orders wrong countless time and even omitted many items we ordered. They charge a lot of money for food that you don't even get. This is one of the worst restaurants i have been to.
Negative	"Compared to other Barro's locations, the food is not as fresh.  Sadly, there is a level of incompetence here.  Employees are either not trained correctly, don't know simple math, or management does not know how to properly display their prices.  You get a #4 lunch special (2 slices of pizza and a drink) for $4.  Clearly states that.  Slices of the day, pretty self explanatory.  No where does it say that if you get the slice of the day that it's an additional charge of .50 something cents per slice.  Inconsistent is the word I would use here.  Some days I get charged $4.50 something.  Other days it's $5.50 something depending on who is working.  Extra one dollar isn't going to break me or worth bickering about but more a matter of principle.  

If you're going to charge more for the slice of the day, POST IT!  Tell your people that $4 and tax does not equal $5.50 to $5.80!"
Negative	"Disclaimer: I got two tickets for free because I donated blood. They were about to expire on July 31st, and seeing how yesterday (7/25/11) was my only night off, it was as good a time as any to use up the ticket. My sister also had two free tickets so we were trying to get her boyfriend and one of my friends to come. No dice. 

Okay, I didn't have high expectations either, but when my friends were like, ""eh... don't waste your time"" I just thought it was because they wanted to chill at home. I should have listened!

We got to Planet Hollywood and were told we could ""upgrade"" to VIP for $22 a person. Don't do it. The map makes it look as if the theater is humongous and the general admission seats are in the north 40. Don't worry, the theater seats less than 450 people, and it's stadium seating - you will be able to see from every seat. 

I LOVED that the usher girls volunteered the fact that the first row of the bottom portion of general admission seating is crap. When we sat in the seats anyway, we noticed it was because you couldn't see the apron portion on the stage. We moved up to the third row, right next to the sound and lighting booth and had a perfect view. 

If you're under 30 and were paying the general admission ticket price of $80, I bet you wouldn't be rating this 4 or 5 stars, guaranteed. The fact I got my tickets for free isn't going to make this a 4 or 5 star experience. Disclaimer, I work for a show and my sister is in theater management, so we consider things that the average consumer might not.  

I found the show to be kind of cheesy and the acts could have been cleaner. Things that were supposed to be synchronized were not. The timing was off. If you can't get perfectly synchronized, don't do it. It was like watching a very good quality high school musical - not a Vegas quality show. Things like the costumes and headdresses weren't matched or lined up correctly or that the acrobats were kind of all over the place cheapened the act. The Hispanic lady (I think her name is Joelle or something?) at the beginning of the act looked like she was over the whole thing. The mics were set too high, so it made it difficult to make out what exactly the singers were saying. As well, there are 3 or 4 lights on up center stage, that at times shown directly in my eyes. They were so bright, I had to turn away because it was blinding. They need to fix that. 

The black Sonny for Sonny and Cher was sort of funny. I'd say the only cool act was the magic act. I have no idea how many doves were stuffed into that guy's suit jacket. The gigantic parrot added to that... wow, he was full of birds. I also have to give credit to the band that was playing. I enjoyed the guitar the most. Oh, and I felt like clapping when they were showing the implosions of all the old casinos. To this day, I don't understand the infatuation with 50 year old gambling halls in this city. The old ones look like a blight on the Strip and... well, would you rather have the Frontier or City Center? Ummm... the later, please!

My sister kept checking the time and said she was awfully bored. There were people in the rows in front of us that were just done. They looked like they had fallen asleep in their seats. It would have been nice if the cocktail waitresses weren't walking around the whole time with obnoxious light up cups - at times they blocked the view. It was good that they told everybody to turn off their phones and that there are no pictures allowed. 

If you haven't seen any show, especially a Cirque show, and you're over the age of 35, you'd probably enjoy this show. Otherwise, I'd say you can pay the same amount and see some spectacular shows. The older people in the audience (and I mean people over the age of 60) seemed to love the show, but for me, meh. I've experienced better."
Negative	"Let me start off by saying I have never written a yelp or online review before. But in this case I HAVE to write one. I am a new tenant here, it has been less than a month and it has been nothing but literal hell. I came here to save money, I get the whole ""you get what you pay for"" ordeal, but this place is not necessarily ""cheap."" I am currently paying almost 800 in rent to live with roaches. Yes roaches! And not just a few here and there but an infestation of them. When I first moved in I noticed one scampering across the floor, okay I get it maybe it got in from outside when we were moving. But no. It has only gotten worse. I am writing this review to warn anyone looking to move here. Please do not be swayed by their nice model apartments and leasing office. If you have children please steer clear! This place is an extreme health hazard. I am now finding dead roaches in my freezer and refrigerator, which led me to having to throw away all food products. Yesterday I found a hatched roach egg sac behind my microwave, only then to find nymphs scurrying across my kitchen floor and walls. I am scared to sleep or do anything here. I am disgusted. I do not believe that the front office staff has any regard for anyone's problems here. My issues went ignored for two weeks. To add the cherry on top they moved me into an apartment where the door has been previously kicked down. They still have not fixed it. The door has cracks everywhere, allowing bugs and heat to come in. It is also off its hinges, making it extremely hard to close, open, and lock. Scary right!? Please save you money, health, and well being. Look elsewhere and maybe spend a little more. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Currently I am stuck with no water, and the hot water is always being shut off. My A/C went out and they could not bother to return my emergency call. Everyday before I go to work I have had to check my tires for nails because the little kids that live here go unsupervised and put nails under the tires. It has been less than a month of living here and everyday has been utter hell. Please look elsewhere."
Negative	This is by far my favorite obgyn doctor. Dr. Feng is phenomenal. However, I currently have an IUD and need a new one. I waited on the phone for 35 minutes for them to tel me I have to pay $860 and then will eventually be refunded. I'm a poor college student and they had been so not helpful. The office manager was also very rude and not helpful for my situation.
Negative	I have gone here several times and each time there is a new problem or a new issue, either with service, providing information, or giving me the wrong prescription.  The wrong prescription they issued me caused migraines; it took weeks to finally get it right.   I strongly do NOT recommend.
Negative	We normally come here and are usually happy with the service. Tonight our bartender was busy so we asked William if we could get ramekins and soy sauce for our sushi. He said yes. William had the GALL to sit next to us with his friends, drink a shot and never told our bartender that we needed the ramekins and soy sauce or get them for us. William represents CRAVE, he was still wearing his CRAVE uniform when he sat down with his VIP friends and drank that shot. Apparently it doesn't count if you regularly go to CRAVE, only if you're friends of William does it matter. I hope William's friends come as often as we did. Or maybe we should befriend William, I think NOT!!!
Negative	"It's heartbreaking putting one star on the store because I thought so highly of it at the beginning. The staff there has always been pretty friendly to me, prices are average. But my reason for one star is for the fact that they sell certain trucks there or RC but they don't carry replacement parts for a lot of the trucks due to space. specially 1/5 scale models. 
The one and only reason why I even jumped on yelp to write a review is- even though I am a regular customer I've never shortchange them always have been honest and on time but they still will not order me a part prior to me paying. L I have no transportation to friendly hobby to swipe my card but you would think the honorable thing to do would just order it for me and I'll pay when I pick it up. it's just a $35 driveshaft guys not only did you lose out on my business for now on you also got a bad review over parts you should carry in your store!! Or should order for me without me having to pay for it on the spot!! 

I hope you guys change your ways then I'll consider coming back but till then Dave's hobby is getting my money"
Negative	I was visiting from Chicago and needed to get my nails done. I asked if they had no chip and they said they did I got a pedi and mani done. The lady that did my no chip got annoyed with me when I told her that several nails looked bumpy and did not look smooth. Instead of re doing the nail she kept trying to file it down . Which caused my finger to bleed. I would never go back and I am a frequent visitor to Vegas.
Negative	My wife and I ate at Flat Iron last night. We had heard mixed reviews and decided to form our own opinion. In short, spend your money elsewhere if you are a foodie. If you like spending your money on mediocrity then this is your place. Visually, the place is very pleasing and leads you to believe you're going to have a great meal-something unique and tasty. My wife ordered salmon and I tried the special flank steak. We split a wedge salad and were shocked by the tiny size of the salad. It had some generic ranch dressing and a few bacon bits. The flank steak was very small I'm guessing 4oz of meat and it came with some steamed bell peppers and I had the mash potatoes. The steak was burnt and had burnt flavor in every bite. My wife had the salmon, it was just ok. Long horn would have been better at 1/3 the price. We had a beer and glass of wine too. The total for the disappointing meal was $85. Wish we would have gone down the street to Toast!
Negative	The worst experience that i have ever encountered. I want to say that the lobby lady was amazing but everyone behind the pizza bar, horrible. Play tag and touching each other in a workplace. Like really people. Its ok to have fun but cussing and screaming not cool. There was a-lot of cucumbers on the tile and i stepped on it and almost slipped i told the chubby hispanic girl who was handling the cashier and she said tell the lady in the lobby cuz its not her job. But she said it in a rude way. I will not eat here again.
Negative	Just had my last dinner here. After ordering a bottle of wine I noticed half way though the name was slightly different from what I ordered. I asked the waitress. She showed me she had rang it in correct and bartender had given her the wrong bottle. She then informed me in tears that the owner/manger was voiding out bottle I ordered and thought I'd been served and charging me for a more expensive bottle. That I could talk to him but he would not reverse it for her. I did. He replied that it was my fault, but he would do the credit ! The service has been great but on several occasions the owners lack of customer service combined with marginal food have made us decide to never go back!! Don't waste your time. No owner who puts a young waitress in tears deserves your business!!!!'
Negative	I wrote a review a couple of weeks ago about our bad service. Dan sent a message over a week ago asking my mailing address to send a gift card, which I did. I haven't rec'd another message concerning this..Again not very considerate.
Negative	Mother's Day Brunch ruined by the wait staff. We walked out before a single item was delivered to us. The waitress was extremely rude, and made us feel uncomfortable. I could not justify giving them a single dollar
Negative	"I have had a few bad experiences with this particular location on different occasions, most of them being customer service experiences. A few months ago, I had seen a bed that I was really interested on Zgallerie.com, labelled as ""Bella Black"" for the color that I was interested in. The African American associate that was assisting me told me that Zgallerie has NEVER made any furniture in black, and that I must have been mistaken. I pulled up the exact picture and description up on my phone and showed her, hoping that she would at least tell me that they only sold it online. Instead, she laughed at me and told me that I was on Pinterest, when I obviously wasn't. I was with my mother, at the time, and my mother saw a few napkin holders on the counter, and she kindly told the same lady ""These are cute! Where can I find these?!"" The lady got very annoyed and rolled her eyes and told her to immediately put them down, and that the ones she was looking at were a customers and shoo'd her in the direction they were placed... My mother was filing a complaint with a male that has been nothing but kind to her, and the lady overheard and started swinging her arms and pointing in a circular motion telling my mother that EVERYONE loves her and that she's a great worker, turned to these elderly women and proceeded to say ""aren't you happy with my service?!"" And made a huge commotion. I was displeased with this service, but has gotten better since this lady was terminated. Up until this evening, everything has gone well.... Besides when traveling a ways away to use a $100 store credit from them, I pulled up and the lights were shut off and it was pitch black. They are supposed to be open until 8pm tonight, and I arrived at 7pm. Please let me know why they are closed an hour early?! It's not a Sunday, and it is definitely not a holiday. I'm so displeased with this location, I'm just about to travel an hour away from home to try and find punctuality and proper customer service at the Scottsdale location. I'd suggest to either look filthy rich for this location and call ahead of time, because the hours can fool you."
Negative	"If I could give this place zero stars I would. But since I have to give a minimum of one the only plus in this place was the food. I've been in the restaurant industry for years and this is by far one of the strangest experiences I've ever had...

My beautiful bride and I walk in and ask for a table for two when they open. Bartender says do you have reservations? Not one person in the place. Host says next time please try to get reservations. 30 minutes later still the only ones in the restaurant.

One of the waitresses tried to bring something behind the bar, and I actually heard the bartender Yell at her to get it out from behind the bar. 

Our server came over to take our order. When my wife ordered the salmon she wanted the sauce on the side. The server said no. I asked why she couldn't have it on the side. She said because there are no substitutions as you can read at the bottom of the menu. 

I can honestly say again that I've never experienced anything like this in my life. We will never be going back."
Negative	"What happened to my favorite trashy country bar?!?! We haven't been out on west 6th in a couple years, but decided after dinner & drinks downtown we would hit up tequila ranch for old times sake. The place was pumping rap which should have been our first heads up that it had changed, but I thought someone made a request & it would go back to country. 

We walked in & quickly realized that it was no longer a country bar.. More of a hip hop/rap club. For a Saturday night around 11 it was pretty dead. We had a quick beer & left"
Negative	I would've given 4-5 stars but they just discontinued my all time favorite menu item--the grilled mahi mahi topped with citrus crab salad.   The rest of the menu is pretty good but this was absolutely delicious every time. We literally would go 2-3 times a week to order this.   Now we are more once every couple months diners.    Hopefully Mgmt will read this review and bring the mahi mahi back permanently.
Negative	The location is convenient for our family but everything else is downhill. The owner of this establishment is the only thing consistent about this place: she is consistently rude to guests. The service/wait times are slow at best.
Negative	"Um...I get that Indian food shouldn't smell good. I get it.
BUT
This place's food smells awful! Stunk up my whole house! Plus, the butter chicken was watered down and the rice was too sticky. Vegetable samosas we're okay though"
Negative	"DO NOT BUY THE WAIST TRAINERS!!

I bought a waist trainer from this location which i was assured was good quality from Colombia not the fake ones from China by the young lady that assisted me. 

In the process of putting on the waist trainer(just putting it on, not even wearing it) two of the clamps supposed to hold it in place completely broke. Keep in mind i had not had the waist trainer even 24hrs.

I called the store to complain and actually just would have liked my money back for the defective product and I was told under no circumstance would they refund or exchange the defective product ...and as a matter of fact the only way that I can go about fixing the issue is if I contact the manufacturer who is in...Colombia.

I decided to keep the defective waist trainer because I am already out of $90..I do not want to send the defective waist trainer all the way to Colombia and most likely never receive another one.

This is the reason I am hesitant in patronizing small businesses... they would rather you take a loss than them... Walmart, target, or any business like that would never ask you to send a defective product back to the manufacturer.. they would either refund you or exchange it.. that is not the case with this business....

The only reason she offered to help me get a manufacturer  exchange was because after she hung up the phone on me I put up a review on yelp which she wanted me to take down if i wanted her assistance in getting a new waist trainer..NO HOW ABOUT YOU REFUND THE CUSTOMER  OR DO AND EXCHANGE ON A DEFECTIVE PROUCT.An important rule of business (to the owner of sunkissed tanning) is FAIR EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY!!

Also Mervat the waist trainer that you had for yourself you told me specifically had broken on you.. 

THESE ARE LOW END PRODUCTS WITH HIGH END PRICES!!"
Negative	"Awful!!!!! I've been taking my daughter here since she was born. No problems. Of course because she never has been this sick. Took her in on Friday for a cough. Doctor checked her and sent her home with allergy medicine. After paying the $170 bill because they said the insurance didn't cover last time. Ok fine I paid. Come Monday my 4 year old is crying and complaining about ear pain. She has BOTH ears infected. How does this go undiagnosed in 2 days!!!!!!!!!!! 
Her father took her in and they WOULD NOT PRESCRIBE HER UNLESS HE PAID THE $80 for the visit. YES after THEY SENT A KID BACK HOME W AN UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED EAR INFECTION!!!! They should be ashamed of themselves his is the last time we take our daughter there. Do yourself a favor and steer away from this devil practice!!! Never again. Mesa pediatrics you don't play with kids health. Disgusting!!!!!"
Negative	"I can't comment on the hotel property as I was unable to stay. I can comment on awful customer services.  I made a reservation through Hotels.com accidentally instead of the Airport Radisson.  The response from the hotel when I try to call and address this problem is that they are too busy to deal with my concerns or call me back.

Also, I won't be using any service like Hotels.com. If Radisson doesn't like how these travel arrangements work, then they perhaps shouldn't either. Everyone one points fingers at the other party and insists you have to contact them."
Negative	Good service. Used a gift voucher and realised only after we had left that the tip % was only calculated on the excess.. Should have paid more attention but the wait staff was a little abrupt which prompted the discussion after we left... Oops :( unfortunately the mashed potatoes and fries tasted old, rib eye was tough, lobster tails overdone. Wouldn't return.
Negative	Republic Cafe does not exist anymore, if it ever did.  I was confused but intrigued by the idea that two restaurants would share the same space and how that would work; apparently it didn't.
Negative	"The service here was great! Our waitress was kind, welcoming, and attentive. What didn't impress me was the food. 

I ordered a salad with light dressing. There was far too much dressing and despite being told the salads were huge, I was able to easily finish mine (as did others at my table). Neither the table nor salad came with bread and butter so there was no carbohydrate to fill the stomach.

The desserts in the case look amazing. Perhaps this would be a nice place for an after-movie dessert treat. Just pass the main course and go straight to the sweets."
Negative	I took my 11month baby because he had been having a fever Dr. Halley-Ibrahim, Jonathan saw him and diagnosed him with ear infection. I was not to convinced of his diagnose because I felt like he didn't check he's ears right it was too quick plus baby was moving a lot. I suggested if the fever was due to him teething. But he again said no he has an ear infection. Not being too convinced I decided to get a second opinion meanwhile I had started him on antibiotics.. long story short. They double checked he's ears and had no ear infection they did other testes and no infection. It ended up being he's teeth. I was very upset if they don't know what's wrong it's ok to say I don't know what's wrong with your child, instead of making up whatever diagnose and putting an infant on antibiotics when there is no need.!!!!
Negative	We were very excited to purchase the perfect sectional for us along with some other furniture for our living room.  This was about a month ago.  Since then, we have yet to receive anything from this company as they are citing a backlog due to material running out at their vendor.  I can understand that, but what I don't understand is their lack of customer service and responsibility to update us on the status.  I didn't even know about the situation until I called them 2 weeks after the purchase!   It's now week 4, and we have yet to receive anything or even have a follow-up call on our status!  I guess spending over $3k is minimal and does not justify any communication.  Maybe if we spend $5k we would get a call.  I think it's time to cancel the order, and it's unfortunate as I had money to spend.
Negative	"Tanzy's at the Scottsdale Quarter has some issues with scale and taste, from both a culinary and design perspective. 
The designer of Tansy's took the concept of large scale a little too far.  The 18 foot high front door and cavernous ceilings were interesting, but when applied to the dining tables, things went awry.
The tables were so wide it was difficult to have a conversation across the table.  And long...probably 8 feet, banquette seating, only accessible at one end, ...we had naugahyde burns on our thighs by the time we shimmied to our place settings.
The menu bills the cuisine as Mediterranean inspired...not sure where that come from?  From the lunch menu, the Penne Salad looked familiar and tired, like the pasta salad my elderly aunt brings to every family pot luck.
The mixed green salad was listed on the menu as containing ""baby mesclun (sic) greens"", apparently the Mediterranean name  for iceberg. 
I ordered the Pan Seared Halibut with roasted tomatoes.  
No tomatoes to be found on the plate, roasted or otherwise, and the halibut should have come shrink wrapped and labeled ""fish jerky"" ...just a tad over cooked.
When the bus boy came to clear, he had to practically climb on the table to reach the dirty dishes and flat wear...we had to pass it all down assembly line style (see above mention of table size and configuration).
The saving grace was the dessert we shared, a light airy puff pastry with caramelized pears, served warm, drizzled with dark chocolate and topped with slowly melting vanilla ice cream...S U blime!
Next time, we'll just go for dessert and coffee and sit at the bar!"
Negative	"Came here for the first time last night-- was with a group of about 15 for a birthday dinner. We all met up at about 8 pm, so the dinner rush was over, and the place had more empty tables than occupied.
Here is why I feel this place is 2-star worthy.

-Waitress was a really nice girl, but the food and drink ordering was very poorly orchestrated.

-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.

-Food was coming at different times. By the time the other end of the table had gotten their food, we were done eating.. even though we all ordered at the same time.

-My order was not correct. I was hungry and ate it anyway. When I told the waitress, she brought out the correct food for me and didn't charge me for it (which I insisted otherwise).. I thought that was really nice.

-The food itself was just mediocre. Living in AZ, you know good mexican food. This place misses the mark.

Just an ok place. Maybe I would have had a different experience if it weren't a group venture."
Negative	"Host was pleasent as can be and i appreciated that. She did ask me if I would like to add any condiments to my sandwich which I did. Although, no one made it, including the cheese, mayo and most veggies. For the high price, skip this joint. 
Second visit, same problem."
Negative	"If you are craving a particular type of Asian food, Tree Country gets them down - Chinese/sushi/Thai.. however that also comes with the expectation and assumption that it won't be authentic, tasting similar to take-out food. I'm not saying take-out food is bad, but do not go for the best Thai, Chinese, or sushi you have had.

Most of the time, Thai food I get at restaurants that are not made to specialize in just Thai food is greasy and just oily and salty. This was also full of heavy sauce, and not particularly strong flavor from spices and fresh ingredients.

Portion and price-wise, it's a solid choice! But no where near great Asian food."
Negative	Total Rip!!! We were promised over a year ago we would get damage repaired!! Gettin old waiting! Went back many times left all phone numbers again to no avail!!!! The manager is nothing but a Pathological Liar!!! Prices are inflated so when they pull out the calculator and crunch numbers it looks like a deal, NOT!! Also the movers damaged our newly painted wall!  Save your money, shop at Sheraton in Willoughby, You'll be glad you did!!!!!
Negative	"Wasn't terrible, but not very good either. Everything was from decent to ""just a pass"". Although lunch wasn't expensive, you can use the same amount of money to get better Chinese food."
Negative	"ÔAprès avoir manger dans un fameux resto indien à proximité, avec des amis, nous cherchions un endroit pour boire un verre, ou prendre un petit thé/café. Ouvrant mon application Yelp, je suis tombé sur le Nouveau Cafe Cozmos, avec des bons commentaires. Nous entrâmes, il y avait 3 personnes, plus une barmaid et quand même beaucoup de machine de loteries.

Le bar était beau, vitré de l'extérieur, donc pas trop sketch pour rentrer. Une belle et sympatrique barmaid pour nous servir. Par contre, elle parlait SEULEMENT anglais...perso, ça ne me dérange pas trop, mais bon certains pourrait être offusqué, la loi 101 you know. Elle nous explique les promotions sur les alcools premium, ce qu'elle a comme bière etc etc. Mon ami demande un old fashion, mon chum un vodka redbull et moi une bière avec un thé pour mon amie enceinte. Il y a seulement une sorte de thé...selon la barmaid, c'était du Green tea, mais on savais que ce ne l'était pas. 

Of course, comme dans presque toutes les places que je vais ces temps-ci, c'est seulement cash..une chance que ma banque était en face. Il y avait aussi un guichet à l'intérieur. 

La serveuse amène nos drinks à la table dont nous nous sommes assis. Je constate que les verres de cocktails sont minuscules, mais vraiment minuscule, ma pinte de bière à d'l'air d'une pichet de 4L comparé aux cocktails. Je  crois que les cocktails étaient en spécial cetye journée là à 6-8$, mais on s'entend...c'était cocktail avec alcool et une boisson X...De plus, je m'aperçois que le vodka redbull de mon copain a été chargé en vodka 6$ plus redbull 4$...le prix est juste...mais elle a gardé la canette de redbull, mon copain est allé la chercher, et elle était rempli au 3/4..

Bref, pour couronner le tout, à l'entrée, il y a un monsieur qui fumait, comme entre la première porte fermé (pour sortir dehors) et la deuxième porte qui était ouverte...résultat une odeur de tabac se faisait sentir. Mon copain, héro de la soirée , est allé lui dire de svp fumer dehors et que mon amie était enceinte. Il ne pleuvait pas, il ne faisait pas trop froid et anyways c'est ILLÉGAL...le monsieur a chialé en disant que c'était un client régulier blablabla...il est allé ce plaindre à ses petits amis du bar et à la barmaid. La barmaid nous a quand même demandé si tout était ok! 

Je donne quand même une étoile pour la gentillesse et politesse de la barmaid et du fait qu'elle travaillait toute seule au bar un samedi soir...! Mais bon je n'y retournerai certainement pas."
Negative	"Took my wife here with shoulder pain on a Sunday, I paid my co-pay then the Dr came in and spent 3 mins with us, he gave her 2 prescription's. 

WE THEN RECEIVED A BILL FOR $1700.00, what a rip off!! 

Go to Urgent Care or a real ER, stay clear of this place!!"
Negative	This place is ok. Maybe it's great for vegetarians but I went with a friend who is vegetarian and I am not. I didn't like the fake meat and even thought I was told it would taste like real meat, I don't think it did. I think a vegetarian or vegan would love this place but I prefer real meat for sure.
Negative	"Came with my family to use the driving range.  Several other families were present with minor children on the range practicing.  The facility was playing loud music containing inappropriate language including the ""f"" word and ""n"" word.  I complained to staff and they immediately turned the music off.  I was advised the owner of the facility selects the music- unbelievable.  They should be ashamed."
Negative	"Meh. I was really excited to finally come here but was pretty disappointed.

When we were almost there, I had the brilliant idea to look for coupons, as I've heard this place was pretty pricey. But we didn't want to backtrack.

We got there and it was $30 per person for one race (12 laps around the track). We asked if there was a local's discount and the lady said ""No, but there are some coupons floating around out there..."" Meanwhile, there's a bunch of receipts next to her with 50% off coupons. Thanks. So we decided to try it out since we were already there. There was a party that filled up the next three races, so we had to wait about 40 minutes. In the meantime, we decided to play their arcade games.

What  a JOKE. In order to play them, you insert money in a machine. It costs $1 to even put money on your ""game card."" We put in $10. Then we realized that each game cost really weird amounts like $1.27, $1.78. Why you ask? So we put more money on our cards and never really get to use the full amount. In other words, so you waste your money.

The race was fun, but the track was too narrow. Impossible to pass, or be passed, without bumping into anything. Which is highly prohibited. 

To sum it all up, two words: OVER PRICED.  Will not return, unless it costs me $12, like I saw on all the other receipts. 

**TIP** If you check in on Facebook you get a free Monster."
Negative	I love Giada's recipes and was so excited to be able to eat at this award wining chefs restaurant. Disappointment would-be an understatement. My friend and I ordered the seafood tower. It came much later than the rest of our tables appetizers. When it finally came the tower was terrible. Not fresh an frankly not edible. The manager offered to take it off the bill and compted dessert. My friends were also disappointed in their food. It was just edible. The service was terrible, food portions small and expensive. Thank goodness for dessert. It was delicious.
Negative	"Walked in on a busy evening and was asked how many....Told the hostess that we were sitting at the bar for the ""Buy 1 Get 1"" special we had received an Email on. She said to us ""Ohhhhh we don't do that....we're a franchise restaurant and do not partake in those specials"" we turned around and left and have not been back since."
Negative	"Prime example of form over substance. I usually skip touristy terrasse places on the main street but seeing how there's a sign that says ""smoked meat & bière $9.99"", I thought at worst it's an OK deal.

As expected, it was a salt assault, both from the commercial freezer-grade smoked meat and the mustard it was drenched in. However, the thinly cut slices of meat were steamed tender, and the bread was a soft bakery-style bread. More meat and less mustard would have advanced it to some extent. Think Costco smoked meat with way less meat and better bread. The salad was most uninspiring - tiny and drenched in Kraft-like dressing.
Service was quick and efficient, nice setting as well with the outside terrasse. If not because they decided to charge me $3 more for the salad (it turns out it's not included contrary to what I have been told), it would have been a 2-star. Not worthy of returning to try other items.

Tip to the manager: when your waitress has already determined the total of the bill and I'm about to enter my PIN, don't pull my card out to charge me $3 more. I already asked your staff when entering your establishment whether fries or salad is included and they said yes. This time I paid what's asked plus the standard tip because I wasn't sure whether the error would be deducted from my waitress's paycheck or not if I insisted. But have the decency to absorb a $3 loss next time. Or at least make the salad palatable."
Negative	"Decent food, terrible service. I mean, absolutely awful. A mix of inexperienced wait staff along with more experienced wait staff who don't listen or don't care. 

Trying to get a drink refill is a chore. (They don't seem to understand that their tips go up as your check goes up.) Trying to find someone to pay your check takes forever. Forget about dessert. Also forget about getting your salad or appetizer before your meal arrives.

You wouldn't put up with this at Eat 'n Park. We tried to give them a second (and third) chance, because we do like the food, and we like to support local businesses, but we're done."
Negative	"Decor and location is great, and it just about ends there. We understand the cost of doing business in Vegas but at least deliver good tasting food, to begin with the bread basket was a joke and not tasteful at all.
Appetizers were ok, the pasta dish we all ordered since it was homemade was just terrible, a supermarket packaged pasta tops this any day.
They even charged us for the wrong dish that we sent back and was corrected later when we pointed out.
Overall, it was not a $400 dinner for party of 4 with 2 beers and 2 cocktail drinks, I'd say it should've been around low $100 for the experience...
Coffee was great though.
I would recommend this place to people I don't like..."
Negative	"Elf sized food for Giant prices!!
I know small plates, but sharing?? you would need a tweezers to transfer to another plate.
I asked for ice water upfront along w/ a $60 bottle of wine. I asked 3 timesfor a water refill-got filled half way--no ice.
When I asked if they had ice-He said, ""I can get some"" like he was borrowing it from the neigbors, Waiter then returned with a glass of ice that he used his hands to pick up, some fell on my plate-hands again!!!!!!!!!!! My quail w/ foi gras had no foi gras--and was so t i n y--
I think a hummingbird leg, perhaps-that may have justified the price.
$430.00 for 3 women, come on-really??? They were offended that we did not want to sit at the bar-but requested a table so we could talk.
When asked about the Pommes frittes-the waiter said, just plain old French Fries! at that price? NEVER AGAIN."
Negative	"The cash price was 2-3 times that of any other dentist. I've never seen such an easy hourly schedule for a dentist. work 4 times a week and takes every holiday possible. I asked why the higher price and the the receptionist answered for the Dr. ""he uses a special technique to prevent sensitivity after the procedure"". I was sold on quality work. I then was told that I needed a $500 dollar night guard to prevent my front tooth chipping. Which is crap. He fixed the chip and I had to come in two seperate times for him to polish it correctly so that I wouldn't feel the cement. Most importantly, the last time I had to come in, it had to be completely re done since he claimed he could make the tooth fit in the retainer without having the retainer. Simple logic. I told him he couldn't do this several times but ego got in the way. So I put it on that night and woke up with cemen pieces all in the retainer. forcing him to bring me back in, which happened to be one of his many three day weeks. When I paid for this service in cash they didn't even have change. They told me I had to go to the bank for exact change... Unprofessional. On my final visit I told him that my tooth was super sensitive more than ever before and I thought I paid to prevent that. He said ""try some sensitive toothpaste, I'll give you a sample"". He never even gave me the sample.. I now have to dominate one side for eating because it is to sensitive. Dishonest and evasive, claims himself one of the best dentist's in the valley from what public poll? He's all marketing and talk, no skill. Sure does act like a nice guy though, prob the reason for such high reviews, strong purssuasive techniques but in the end dishonest and ignorant."
Negative	First time here. Service was awful and slow af, on a Thursday night at around 9 pm. There was hardly anyone there so it's not like they were busy. The bartender was a stuck up, rude, hipster, bitch. Like come on, smile, fake it, and work for your damn tips. I wondered how the hell she even got hired. It was my friend's and I's first time and we met a group of 4 people there who had already racked up a bill of at least $75. They also said she had been rude all night to them as well, ignoring them and rolling her eyes at every little thing. I wanted to slap the attitude right off her face. We were so nice, polite and patient with her, for her to be treating us like shit. After ordering our drinks, which took 10-15 minutes with a bar that only had 5 people at, we closed our tabs immediately and moved to a big table hoping to be served by waitress instead. But there was no waitress to be seen, my friend went up to the hostess after about 20 minutes of sitting there, then she sent someone over to us. She was nice but kind of an airhead. She brought the food to us and there was a long black hair on the pizza. Sent it back and got another one, it was delicious. Also the beer I was drinking was wonderful, my friends enjoyed their beers as well. Yet it was $9.65 for the smallest glass of beer I've ever seen.. I want to come back here for the beer and food but that horrible service is really stopping me, I don't think I'll ever be coming back. Unless you want terrible, slow, rude employees to wait on you, hair in your food, and over priced delicious food and beer come here.
Negative	I don't normally write reviews for place I get just drinks at but the service here was just so bad. After scanning the reviews, it seems as if this is the norm here. I joined my friends' table and the server ignored me twice before realizing I needed a drink. He looked so confused after noticing I hadn't been served yet as if a group of 4 turned 5 was the craziest thing to happen. Our table got lots of drinks and food and it was a good time. Service was generally attentive but when we got the bill it was just SUCH a mess. He had mixed everyone's items up on the bill and it took so long to figure out.. The last thing you want to deal with after a fun night of drinking.. get it together. I also agree with what other people mentioned about the mandatory 18% gratuity and the wasteful cardboard containers that fly everywhere.
Negative	"why is there shit in a fucking bag it just spilled everywhere
1. bad for the environment
2. hard as fuck to pour
3. ugly as fuck
4. wow it just spilled wonder why
5. it says iced tea but i got a bag of lemonade ugly asses
tasteless and gross 1/5"
Negative	If there was an option for negative stars I would. I unfortunately got into a front end collision and my insurance company recommended this place as well as a few in the east end of the city. Thinking this place was close to the beaches I opted to go to Ensured. The service was decent at first but a 2 week job took a month. When I finally got the car back I had no heat there were gaps in the side skirt. When I told them they said I didn't fill enough coolant but turned out the rad was broken and leaking. Hello? Front end collision? Shouldn't you open the hood and check to see if things were in tact? Ended up being the coldest day on record and driving a few days with no heat and still has signs of damage from the accident.
Negative	"After reading these reviews, some going back a few years I wonder if anyone reads these that has the authority to make any changes.  But here goes another review.
On 2/11/16 I was taken by ambulance to CRMC.  I was given a choice of other hospitals  but made this terrible mistake.  I have no complaints with the ER.  They were efficient and very quick in getting X-rays, CT scans, IV's, pain meds etc.  It was found that I had Pneumo Thorax ( perforated lung).  They said they were admitting me but didn't have a room yet so I was going to the observation area.  Unknown to me at the time, I would never be admitted to a room and would spend 3 days in this ""ward"" which at one time was the old ER.   I soon found out that if I wanted to go to the restroom it was down the hall and around the corner.  I could not make it that far with 2 IV's and so they brought in a ""commode"" chair. (lovely), which  went 1 1/2 days without being tended to (sorry for the grossness)until I finally got someone to clean it.  My room was never cleaned, I was never offered water until day 2 when I had to ask for it.  Never did get a wash bowl and soap.  I ask for the new patient packet which included tooth brush,tooth paste, etc., did not get that but my Husband did bring me that.  The cubicles were kept full with people and visitors coming all hours of the night.  The first night there was so much laughing and hoopla coming from the nurses area which I suspect were the aides as the nurses seemed to be over worked and the aides were having a party, sure don't know why they call them aides.  I had frequent blood work and the last one was the worst.  A very young tech came in and had a hard time with the vein, stuck me 3 times.  A nurse came in, saw she was having trouble and started to do it, this tech said ""oh no, I have it"" and blew the vein. The nurse took over and had no trouble.  I have never had this kind of experience ever. 
I could go on about the quality of the meals, never having the beds sheets changed, room not being cleaned and other issues  that should be totally unacceptable."
Negative	"The place has gone downhill. Smaller everything and higher prices. Service was prompt and friendly. 
We came in on Saturday morning. Years ago you would have to wait to be seated, today we walked right in. Go next door to Babystacks."
Negative	Nothing on the menu looked very good to 3 out of party of 5. So we just all kinda settled on whatever we think we may like most. Surprisingly, the Cleveland Philly was the only thing worth while here and jesus those prices are ghastly.
Negative	"Music is no longer varied on Friday & Saturday nights but  has a DJ that plays nothing but Mexican music and speaks in Spanish. Food is good and the bar staff was great but if you don't speak the language and complain you might get kicked out as I did when I complained to the manger I couldn't understand a word he was saying. I had had 3 drinks in 4 & 1/2 hours, and he told the bartenders to kick me out.  We got into a heat argument and he said "" f**k you old man "" and I used like words back to him. I have been a long time customer of this place but it has changed management and gone down hill ever since."
Negative	The worst bar in downtown, The bartender was the worst bartender I have ever seen I don't know his name but he had two sleeves of tattoos he looked Hispanic I think, I asked for a beer once I got my beer I  paid for it and I asked the bartender if I can get a cup of ice because I like my beer on ice he told me no I am not going to give it to you I asked why he told me are you fucking death so I told him calm down with the attitude he told me oh well I told him again what's with the attitude all I'm asking is for some ice he then touched my can of beer and said what, it's not cold enough get the fuck out of here after that I got really pissed I told to watch his language and calm the fuck down so he called  security and tell security to get me out of the bar becuz I was yelling at him, I don't know if the bartender forgot but there is a DJ probably 10 feet away from the bat so its gonna be loud it's just common sense you have to scream to get a drink or ask for something,  but the bartender wants to be a dick when  all I asked was for some ice never again will I go back the worst attitude the worst bartender seriously mad if you ever read this or management for somebody all I want it was some fucking ice man. Wow. Way to ruin somebody's night you should be thankful u have a job
Negative	"We REALLY should have read the most recent reviews on Sambucas before swinging by. I came with my wife, son and daughter. We decided on Sambucas after shortlisting it down from 10 other restaurants taking part in Summerlicious based on its offering for its prix fixe. The swordfish grabbed my son's attention so we chose Sambucas.

The dinner didn't really get off to a good start as the bread was dry and crumbly. 

For appetizers, we had the arancinis with mushrooms and salad. The arancinis were alright though nothing fancy. The salad had a nice dressing to it.

For the mains, we had the (1) swordfish, (2) grilled sirloin, (3) shrimp & lobster fettuccine and (4) risotto. Let's proceed from best to worst. The risotto was cooked very well and was flavourful. Of the 4 kinds of entrees we ordered, this was by far the best. Definitely would be nice in the Fall or Winter! The next best was the swordfish. It was cooked okay, right on point. It was accompanied by steamed vegetables which were nicely done. The shrimp & lobster fettuccine was okay but the pasta was definitely on the hard side. I like pasta ""al dente""....and this was harder than al dente for sure! Furthermore, it was dry as it lacked any sauce. The sirloin really bad! It was ordered as rare (I was shooting for medium rare) and it came out medium well. Since it was a long wait, I didn't ask for it to be returned and re-done. But it was really chewy and even with a steak knife, it was rather hard to cut! I really can't say I was the least bit impressed by that.

Now for the piece the resistance...dessert! We ordered two deep fried tiramisu and two creme brulees. The tiramisu was actually served wrapped in a crepe (think burrito!). The tiramisu inside was borderline okay but the presentation wasn't quite our thing. The creme brulee was REALLY BAD!!! It was almost like a cross between a creme caramel (in that it was really light) and a creme brulee. But the consistency was bizarre. It was not smooth, nor was it firm. It was quite chunky...almost like a rice pudding. 

I don't know if the quality of food was so poor BECAUSE we ordered off the Summerlicious menu. If so and Sambucas was hoping we will never return, then they achieved that goal."
Negative	On my way to another eatery, I was intrigued by the reviews and decided to override my initial choice. I ordered the 10 piece chicken, Mac and cheese, and the coleslaw. Because it was take out only, I was told it was about a 20 minute wait. I asked for the picnic basket so I could take it across the street and eat with my 3 children. 45 minutes later (!!!!) I ditched the picnic basket idea and went straight home. I now had big expectations for this much talked about fried chicken.  The big chunky pieces of chicken were fatty and undercooked. Unbelievable! The Mac and cheese lacked pep, and the coleslaw was actually the only saving grace of the whole meal and that's not great given my kids didn't get past the fatty chicken. Neither did I. It was frankly just gross. I really really really wanted to like this place as the people were friendly and the atmosphere lively.  Will keep looking for the best fried chicken because it's definitely not at this place.
Negative	"For a place called ""Hard Rock Live"" this place doesn't seem to know how a rock show works. There is jumping and there is pushing and there is moshing. None of this has malicious intent. It's just people having fun and forgetting their worries. The security here needs to get their act together and stop picking on show goers for dancing to their favorite band. I would give this venue zero stars if it were an option. 

Also maybe get a barricade that won't fall over when the crowd rushes. One day someone is going to get seriously injured because of it."
Negative	"I did the online check in and preregistered before coming in and showed up at my assigned time but that was a joke and a waste of time. I was told by the very rude front desk lady that they don't pay any attention to that option and was offended when I suggested somebody should remove that option from their website. 
Anyhow I sat down in the waiting room where there was two TV's turned on one of them was playing Spanish soap operas and was a pretty loud (apparently she wasnt going to miss her soap operas by being at work) and the other was English news but was muted. That was pretty annoying due to the fact the only people in the waiting room spoke English. While waiting a guy came in and was upset that he was given the wrong prescription. 
The rest of my visit was just as pleasant as the first part. They didn't have an actual doctor on site. They lack communication from one staff member to another is nonexistant. The physicians assistant doesnt take the time to listen and the diagnosis reflects such."
Negative	"Thank goodness it was dark in there, well lit and this dirty little stop might have been horror movie ready. Along with the bad lighting this was the least franchise-like location I have seen. While decor is not highly important to the eating experience, when it actually detracts from the experience I have an issue. This Swiss Chalet was less chalet and more axe murderer hideout, filled with large amounts of dollar store paraphernalia which both collected dust, and took up valuable space. 

As far as food went it was your standard sauce and fries, I tried the new fishthey are offering and it was alright. Tartar sauce was a relishy mess tasting more like sweet and sour sauce than said tartar, and if I was you I would just leave the tiny coleslaw in its tiny cup as it was pretty bland. 

Bottom line...I love chalet sauce, but this restaurant made it turn in my stomach, bring your wet wipes if you dare."
Negative	Took my girls to get their bangs cut-worst experience ever!!! The lady (Shayla) that cut my 4 year olds hair messed her bangs up so bad that she thought it was a good idea to curl her bangs and BURNED HER FOREHEAD AND DID NOT TELL ME!!! I noticed it when we were shopping and went back to ask her about it she was not even apologetic! Took everything in me not punch her! If these ladies can't even cut kids bangs, I dont want to imagine what damage they can do when they give a complete haircut!
Negative	Pretty disappointing. I'm from California and I've eaten a ton of real Mexican food. This isn't. Who ever puts their burritos in a sandwich grill? No, sorry. Food quality was about what you expect from a fast food joint.
Negative	They are so terribly over priced along with DirectTv. The signal cut out all the time and sometimes would go for days before it worked regularly again. When I called someone they had the nerve to try to charge me for their satellite malfunctioning. It's their equipment after all. After I cancelled I checked my account 4 or 5 times to make sure there were no lingering charges. I get a notice in the mail 3 months after I cancel saying I have 5 days to pay a $28 unpaid fee or it will be taken to collections. When I called all they could say is sorry the information did not get to you. I'm sorry, but you have my email, address and phone number. I could have been easily reached days after I cancelled. I don't appreciate the notice with 5 days to pay it. Your service is garbage and overpriced and I will not be coming back! If I could give a zero I would.
Negative	"Ok fan of Market District and visit often.  Today I stopped at the store to pick up a few things and I was hungry so decided to stop at the hot food buffet.  I selected two pieces of fried chicken and some roasted red potatoes.   Its disappointing when you purchase chicken and it tastes like FISH?!  It was very unpleasant.  I do not eat seafood.  I have tasted it all too.  The batter was probably used for fish too but never understood that.  Not everyone likes fish!  

I had to throw the fried chicken out because every piece tasted like fish.  I was still hungry I took a bite of the red skinned potatoes ..  they were very bland and tasted like chemicals ??  Very disappointing ...  I have ate at the buffet in the past but today is was a very disappointing trip  and a waste of $$.  The hot food buffet isn't cheap. 

Now I just ordered a pizza."
Negative	"Normally have a pretty good experience here, but last night ordered the Mahi and it got to the table somewhat raw
Manager indicated it was Sashimi grade Mahi, but from the smell it certainly was not fresh. Also first prepared Mahi I ever had that was delivered raw in the center.
They made amends, free drinks and desserts but I must admit I was surprised as it was an early dinner, and not yet busy for a meal to be uncooked. 
I'll stick with the wood fire entrees in the future"
Negative	More incompetence from the front office staff. My husband gets a robo call this morning to confirm MY appointment on 8/28. They have all of my information including my phone number. Why is my HUSBAND getting a confirmation call and not me? Not only that, but they promised to send my prescription refill to my pharmacy last Friday 8/18 and as of today, Tuesday 8/23, my pharmacy still does not have said refill.
Negative	"Terrible place!! I had a 1:00 appointment and just got there at 12:58 
The man said are you the 1:00 I was just getting ready to call you... sorry we are behind because someone called in and we can't get to it today!! My neighbor was on way to pick me up after I left the car...Sorry excuse for business practices! Will never be back!"
Negative	"Due to a funeral, we traveled last minute to Vegas and stayed at Sam's Town due to its proximity of the services.  My wife and I were a little put-off by our experience there.  I'll begin by saying that it is in a very questionable part of town.  So, if you plan on staying there, be mindful of what is left in your car and your surroundings if you walk to one of the surrounding businesses.  

Now, let me address Sam's Town hospitality as illustrated by three experiences I had.  First, the ""Fitness Room"" is a converted room that only fits five people and lacks something as basic as a treadmill.  Looking around at the octogenarians that make up 80% of the patrons, I'm sure the fitness room isn't a huge draw for the place.  Understood and accepted.  So I made due by using the most remote of their three parking structures to run laps up and down it.  I would do a little hill-like running while staying protected from the sun and Vegas heat.  I was 20 minutes into my run, with about 10 minutes to go, when stopped by one of their security guards.  I was told they have a ""no exercise policy in their parking garages"" due to the ""obvious safety issues"".  Two things.  One, I find it hard to believe that more than myself and maybe one other person has used the parking structure for a workout in the past decade.  I'm sure this was not a pressing safety issue that needed to be addressed, now or at any time in the past.  Two, I was running between floor 2 and the top, which was devoid of any cars (well, there were probably 4 cars near the elevator on floor two, which was opposite the area I was running in).  I was yet to even see a car pull into the garage as it was about 7am in the morning.  I asked if he could overlook it for the next 7-10 minutes, which got a curt replay of ""absolutely not, son"".  I let him know I'm 42 years of age and if I was his ""son"", he would have been about 12 when he sired me.  I finished my run elsewhere.  In all, it's a stupid interaction but set the tone for what we experienced the rest of the weekend.  

Later that evening, my son wanted to bowl, so we went downstairs to their alley.  I've had a couple of ""twilight zone"" experiences where the attitudes of the workers were so hostile that I thought I was being Punked.  This was one notch worse.  Three point of sale terminals being manned by three employees.  At first I stood in line until noticing an open employee.  When I addressed her I was given a ""she'll help you,"" referring to the line I had been standing in.  I stood there for another five minutes while the person in front of me was helped; all the time the other woman texted on her phone.  When I did obtain help, the first girl I actually found more pleasant.  I have a 4-year-old and asked if he could use a ramp to roll the ball down.  I was told ""if I have time I'll try to get one"".  I kept my eye on the service while we bowled and when I returned the stuff.  I was shocked by the overall hostility of all three women working behind the counter to every request the people around me made.  

Last, I dropped my wife off at the back door to carry my sleeping son to the room after a long evening on the Strip.  I handed her our only keycard.  I couldn't get access to the elevators to the rooms without it.  So there I stood with a stroller, both my wife's purse and kid's backpack, along with a couple of bags from shopping.  I grabbed an employee and asked if he would let me in.  ""Why did you forget your key?""  ""Are you staying here?""  ""What's the room number and name on it?""  All answered.  Followed by a second round of questioning.  ""Why don't you just call your wife to come down?""  ""How did her phone die, didn't she bring a charger?""  Apparently a middle-age guy, dressed in funeral slacks and collared shirt, holding the all the things that point to a fun family outing, is the new face of ISIS or bum looking to sleep in the hallway.  

On the flip side there rooms were clean and physically, the place is not bad.  But my wife and I were so turned off by our interactions with the staff we cannot recommend it.  There are lots of off-Strip locations to stay on the cheap.  Pick one of those if you are hitting Vegas."
Negative	I watched a senior citizen experience very rough care from this doctor. As others highlighted the receptionist is extremely rude. She gave a command to an older client and when this older client didn't follow through fast enough she became snooty. There was no regard for the fact that maybe this senior hadn't heard her or had slower processing time.
Negative	This place not only has Terrible food for the last few years but the owner and manager are awful people. They say horrible things to paying customers. They are the type of despicable human beings that interrupt funeral services to scream derogatory comments at grieving friends and family because there parking spots were being used. The owner writes reviews on his own place on Yelp to help his score. He is a flat out sociopath with no sympathy for anyone other then himself.
Negative	"I used to really like this Casino.  There are so many to choose from and this was one of my favorites.  I use the term, ""was"" because of something that happened on Monday night. I was playing one of the newer Buffalo Machines.  I hit the Bonus where the wheel spins.  The wheel spun alright and landed on $500....that's when things went down hill.  The lights on the machine went out, as if the power was turned off. This is AFTER it landed on $500.   Mind you I'm in the middle of a ""Bonus"", and the wheel just stopped on the $500.  Dead center on $500.  I'll be darned if after seeing the words ""wheel Initializing"" flash across the screen, the wheel started turning again.  No lights still, and the wheel turned slower than it did during my ""Bonus"".  Suddenly, the lights came back on and the wheel started turning again at it's normal speed!  Low and behold it landed on $50.00!  Yep, that's right, $50.00.  I was Pi$$ed off!  Called the Slot Supervisor.  She replayed the last play.  It did everything as described above.  With a very insincere face and tone, she said, ""Oh honey, I'm sorry you didn't get your $500.  There was a power outage in the middle of your play.""  Seriously!  What a crock!  B.S.!  I have been Chairman Status at Station Casinos.  I play a lot.  So I asked to speak to a Casino Host to see if they would at least throw me some free slot play.  Not only did I get rejected for that, the guy at the Rewards Center told me that unless you are currently Chairman or President (I'm not), the Casino Hosts won't even talk to you! O.M.G  Done.  There are other Casinos in this town.  I'll give away my money elsewhere."
Negative	"Seriously! what kind of place is this? 

I went for the buffet lunch on one Sunday. The buffet is okay. They have a decent menu. My good experience ends there. 

The staff were unfriendly. Did not check what their customer wants to drink? Also the smile is missing from their face which I take a sign of welcome. Come on! People are not there just to eat. Right? Have to get up and ask for the check. There were many things inconsistent in terms of the service."
Negative	Looks like a nice store from the exterior but quite disappointed on the interior.  Lots of empty shelfs & racks.  Not a lot of youth swimwear. Hard to even shop with how bright the sun is shining in the Windows.  We are from out of state on vacation & was hoping to find some Arizona gear but very small & limited selection.
Negative	"I love wings as much as anyone but this place loses me with their over preparation of its wings. EVery sauce seemed to be loaded with thick syrupy candy. Tasting any chicken is an afterthought with these wings, its all about the sauces. Which to me, are way too sugary.

Tried 5 different flavors, the JAlapeno one was by far the most tolerable.

The atmosphere is sports bar and the acoustics of the building could not be worse. A guy screams because of a touchdown on the other side of the bar and it will send shocks up your spine as you sit on the most uncomfortable sold wood booth seat ever.

Pass."
Negative	I really want to like this place. It's close by & I can get a veggie burger quickly. The staff is nice. However, they've never once gotten our order right & we've probably gone there 4x or so within a span of 1-2 years. We went there again today to give it another shot, but nope, they screwed up both mine & my bf's order. The burgers we ordered literally had avocado in the name but neither of our burgers came with avocados on them. They still tasted fine but I specifically got that burger for the avocados. Maybe someday they'll get it right, but I doubt we'll ever go back again. The sweet potato fries were okay, kinda soggy though. My bf liked his chili cheese fries.
Negative	"I had dinner last month at Joe's in Miami, and dinner at Joe's in Vegas a week ago.

Miami Joe's is still very good, but Vegas Joe's is going downhill. 
Food was dull and uninspired.
Plus my dinner companion's seabass entree came out halibut.

The waiter did his best to make up for the mix-up, but something like that just shouldn't happen at a restaurant with Joe's history and pedigree.

Say it ain't so, Joe."
Negative	"If I could give Century Link ""negative"" stars, I would. I had been a customer of Century Link's for about the last two years. I recently moved out of state, so I was unable to transfer my Century Link service, not that I would have anyway given my horrible experience with this company. Still, the company refused to refund a cancellation fee of a whopping $139.80 !!!

First of all, I was unaware that I was even on a ""contract"" given that I had been with the company more than a year....I assumed it was month-to-month after a year. In addition, there had never been any mention of such a cancellation fee. When I cancelled my service, I specifically asked if there would be any further charges, and the representative indicated there would not be. Yet, they charged me twice during the month following the month I cancelled. They even took a pro-rated credit of $55 that should have been a REFUND for ME, and they used it to put towards this sudden, ""cancellation fee.""

Just like any other time I have called CenturyLink, it took me at least an hour, three or four different departments and four or five customer service reps, and still nothing was done about removing the fee. The final ""supervisor"" I spoke with, ""Jose,"" was like a robot who wasn't going to budge whatsoever about the fee. He was rude and not one single person had empathy for my situation or even apologized or offered any type of reasonable explanation.

As long as I have been with Century Link, deceptive billing practices have been a part of their mode of operation. Almost EVERY time I have called in to dispute an increased charge, it takes at least almost an hour and three different reps at least. In addition, they often say they will fix an error they made on my bill only to FAIL to fix it, and then I had to call a second or even third or fourth time to get the matter resolved. It is such poor customer service and such a failed framework of doing business that there is no other answer other than purely unethical business practices and deception to consumers. This practice of saying they will fix something and then not doing it, (or raising the cost on my bill without reason) has made me feel like they are an enemy that I have to watch out for. I have constantly had to watch what they bill me each month because of their past behavior. And half the time, there is an error that requires several phone calls and hours on the phone to resolve. 

I cannot understate how strongly I advise all potential internet customers to go with THE OTHER GUY (Whomever that may be in your city), but please save yourself some frustration, money, time, and stress and choose Cox or TimeWarner or whoever else offers Internet in your city. I WISH I had gone with Cox when I lived in Phoenix, but I had chosen CL because of a faster internet speed or something. I can't recall now. I WAS actually warned by someone else, and I got suckered in by the faster speed for a lower rate or something, and did not take my friend's advice. I immediately regretted it but was stuck in a contract. The first thing they did to screw me over was charge me for a modem they told me was going to be free. It is apparent that the employees of CL are trained to sell in a deceptive manner, bill in a deceptive manner, etc. Even the monthly bills are MEANT to be complicated to the point where even a person like me who holds a doctoral-level degree, has a difficult time figuring out what all the taxes and charges are for. 

Even when I put in a complaint on their Web site about this matter, I had to have a ""three digit code"" that is APPARENTLY listed on a copy of my bill after my account number. I had to have this just to complete the form, even though I had ALL of my other info, and it would have been extremely easy for them to pull up my old account with all of the other info. Yet, they require the three-digit pin (which I had never noticed before now, particularly since, like MOST people, I get my bill on e-mail), ---I believe they require the pin on the form to DISCOURAGE complaints. They don't want to help you. They just want your money and for you to go away. 

The long customer service wait times, the repetitive transferring to different departments, not dealing with someone in your own state, etc., is all meant to stonewall you. I could see it from the beginning. Even the recent call I had with them to try to get this fee removed was one big stonewall. An hour. Four or five representatives and three or four departments. It's their mode of operation, and I'd be extremely surprised if these deceptive practices are not unlawful under the consumer acts. Because of this, and because of the way they do business and the way I have been treated for two years, and then this final disrespect with the $140 cancellation fee and refusal to refund, I just cannot say a good word about this unprofessional, disrespectful, greedy, company. I give my strongest disapproval rating to Century Link. Please heed my warning."
Negative	We received very poor customer service while visiting the self service dog wash. They cleaned the other bathtub in the small room we were in (with poor ventilation) with bleach and harsh chemicals while we were using the facilities rather than waiting until we were finished. The woman at the front desk was very pushy and unwelcoming and made us feel uncomfortable the whole time. At the end of our visit she actually followed us outside to tell us we weren't supposed to take a bandanna (which had always been offered complimentary before). Policy aside it is incredibly inappropriate to follow your customers out the door in that manner. We used to visit here every dog bath time but now we will not be going back. Haven't used the daycare/boarding facilities but I wouldn't recommend them if this is how they treat their customers.
Negative	"You know, to cut straight to the point, this store is a huge disappointment. You will never see me shop here again. The two stars is because I just happen to be deeply in love with Trader Joe's, because if this was my first visit they'd be getting one star.

I used to work at TJ's many years ago, but I know the culture that made this brand a success has not changed. This store needs to be re-educated on what being a part of this place means, STAT.

I have never been to a TJ's that has such a limited stock of things. Please remember, I've worked at a TJ's (in VA) and I understand ordering, stocking, etc. That they were out of spinach, broccoli and their jalapenos were wrinkled from age tells me something is really amiss here. They actually only had one beefsteak tomato in the whole store. And you can tell that no one really gives a care. The guy I asked about stock acted like I was asking him to predict with 100% accuracy the Presidential race. No, honey, I just need to know why I can't get common vegetables here. 

Went down an aisle clearly in search of something. There was a girl there and she either had major OCD or she was just straightening clipped items to avoid my intense can-I-get-some-help-here stare. Obviously we know which one it was.

They have a sample bar in the back of the store where they're always trying out the new things they get in. At the store I worked at, and many that I've been to, you generally call out to a potentially interested shopper (the ones that glance over for more than a second) and ask if they'd like to try a sample. These people avert their gazes and hope you don't steal what is probably their lunch because unless you get in their face and demand a taste, you aren't getting anything. It's really to the edge of rude. Fix that, please.

Same thing with the wine tasting in the section where the alcohol is set up. It was right in front of the beer, which I was taking great interest in and it was obvious. I was searching for a beer that a nearby TJ's had (and where the section manager gave me a full rundown on beers/wines/spirits that made me feel like he cared - ahem) but couldn't find at this one. The non-busy wine tasting guy completely ignored me like I was invisible. Great customer service, keep it up.

This store is a complete anomaly. I have yet to experience this sort of terrible customer service at any of the many stores I've been to (from coast to coast). They should be embarrassed, this store gives TJ's a really bad name. 

I think I'm going to call the head office, actually, because just writing this review doesn't feel like enough. TJ's is a great store, but this location needs help."
Negative	"I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service wasn't good, they had a very horrible language barrier. Food was flavorless, I was very disappointed given the reviews I have read.
The salsa station was empty, then we told them that they couldn't even understand us.
I was disappointed, we will never go back."
Negative	2nd time, can't find a groomer in Ahwatukee since moving here tried another place it was stinky so tried here again - the groomers/owners are great people but I am disappointed with the haircut again and that I can't communicate with them what I want - a normal haircut for yorkies (been able to do in the past).
Negative	"This hospital is a totally all for the money. I took my cat here  to get her annual vaccinations and was charged way too much. They even surprised me with a stool simple of my cat ; which  I thought it was free, but they charged me $50. The total of my vaccinations was around $200. This is way too much!

I recently moved here from another city. The vet hospital I used to go for vaccinations charged me $70 for the vaccinations pass tax... I will never take my cat here again. way too expensive."
Negative	Very dissapointed in the product. Being an Italian New Yorker, it was nothing like home. Very overpriced for the portions and all 4 items we purchased were very dry and bland. Will not go back.
Negative	"Stop calling your customers after they complete service - especially for just an oil change on a perfectly running car (on the guise that you are calling to see how the service went) - to sell them new cars!  You call me every time and I have asked that a note be in my file to NOT call.  Also, I have yet to see the hair salon, nail salon or any of the other services open for me to use while there.  Two years now and I have not seen these services open once! Is it just for show?

Car service great; customer service and 'extras' not so great."
Negative	"Ordered wine for $13/glass.  Asked them to make sure it wasn't old.  They assured me it wasn't.  I told them I would know right away.  Sure enough, $13 wine tasted like rubbing alcohol and was ""corked.""  Sent it back.  They opened new bottle.  New bottle was fine.  
Then ordered $16 crab cakes.  They were frozen and fried. Doubt they were even crab.  Isn't this a seafood restaurant? They tasted like frozen fish sticks.  A $16 crab cake at a seafood restaurant should be like they are at other places, lump crab meat, not fried on both sides.  I'm so done with this place.  I only gave it 2 stars because my friend ordered oysters and said they were good."
Negative	"Very above average, if not a little past its prime.  Looks like it's been about 10 years since a renovation of the entire place although some rooms might have gotten an upgrade in parts.  Something not quite 100% with the place.
However, clean rooms and nice people.  No HD even though my TV was an HD.  What's up with that?"
Negative	Was satisfied with the service, but the quality of the steak was not to my satisfaction. I asked for a rare steak, and received a medium well, my server did not respond fast enough to have the issue corrected. Would have enjoyed it more if my meal was cooked correctly.
Negative	Seems like they have very shitty customer service!! I called to find out if they carry 3D blue ray movies and the girl was obviously too fucking dumb to know the answer, so she hung up on me. I called right back and she immediately placed me on hold where I waited for 10 mins with no answer. Attempted to call back, but the line just kept saying the caller was busy. So now fuck this place doesn't seem like they can be trusted anyway after reading the abundance of shitty reviews. I've been to Zia records in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
Negative	"We were recently subjected to the enormous disappointment and displeasure of having brunch at Lon's, this despite the beautiful, enchanting setting.   In short, both the service and food were abyssmal.   Although we had a reservatioin, upon arrival our reception was far from cordial and/or welcoming.  It was as if we were somehow unexpected and/or an annoyance.  Once we were seated in the garden, we waited a very long time until our waiter, looking quite dishelveled, finally arrived.   Although he was cordial, he seemed rather uncertain and had some difficulty understanding our order; in fact he returned to the table twice to review what we had ordered.  He subsequently proved to be quite inept in the most rudimentary tasks, as well, reaching across the table in front of one guest to place something before another guest (twice), touching clean silverware at the tines and blades rather than the handle, and disappearing for long stretches of time until we went looking for him (twice).

     We ordered drinks and water first.  The drinks arrived after a considerable wait, but no water accompanied them.  Finally, after mentioning the water to our waiter three times, and then to other employees twice, we finally received a bottle of water which was not adequate for the four of us.  When the food arrived, with the exception of the kale salad, it proved to be very disappointing.  My husband ordered huevos rancheros, but what he received hardly conformed to the traditional Mexican dish, which generally consists of scrambled eggs liberally laced with chorizo and salsa.  What he received was a piece of something called ""fry bread"" (a kind of limp, tortilla-like concoction) covered with a very modest layer of refried beans mixed with a bit of tasteless ground meat that had absolutely no resemblance to chorizo;this was topped with a single fried egg.  I ordered the short rib hash, which was no better.  It was dry and tasteless, and the poached eggs were also tasteless and too well done.  A single piece of cold toast with the tiniest amount of butter accompanied the dish.  Although I did enjoy my salad, I had expected and certainly would have appreciated some bread or crackers;however, we received none.  In both our cases, and that of our friends' entrees, we were surprised at the very meager portions. 

     Although we have lived in Scottsdale for many years, we travel extensively, both for business and pleasure, in the U.S. as well as in various European countries, often spending 3-4 months per year away from home.  Hence, we have experienced a wide variety of cuisines in any number of restaurants at various price points, and based on our experience, we believe we are absolutely justified in judging the food and service at Lon's to be absolutely sub-standard.  It's a pity that in this truly unique and inspiring setting, no one seems to know  enough, or perhaps to care enough about the essential purpose of the place."
Negative	I've been nothing but disappointed with this YMCA. The Rockwall has practically no hours and even when it's supposed to be open it's often not. They never put up the workout schedule online until it's way past time, today is a new thing for August and they still have the July schedule. The kids area does not have a baby section or any toys or equipment suitable for babies. Classes are limited. Staff has not been helpful. They WAY over charge for their sports, and charge even extra for competitive sports when they don't give you anything extra. All around not a good experience.
Negative	This place sucks, security staff are assholes! Don't waste your time or money. No seating, pricey weak drinks and moronic staff. MC was entertaining but that's about it, bartender was a biatch!!!!
Negative	"Stopped in this morning for a breakfast burrito. I'd been here a few times for lunch but was craving a breakfast burrito and realized I was close by.

Unfortunately it was a disappointment - perhaps I've been spoiled by breakfast options in San Diego, but this was not great. The tortilla was too thick and chewy, the eggs tasteless, potatoes average, and the only flavor was chorizo. Worse, the salsa bar wasn't available so it was very dry.

On a related note the coffee was sub-par, really unacceptable given the great coffee available in CLT.

Phat burrito, I'm sorry but you let me down."
Negative	"I have had better food and service at Ryan's. We paid $32 per person and a 18% gratuity because we sat with relatives at the same table so a total of $38 per person. 

The meat (prime rib, salmon, sausage) was all over cooked. The pasta was cold. The dessert bar was lack luster. The menu posted outside specifically stated ""hot lava cake"" (the reason my in-laws wanted to eat there) but it was not actually being served.

The server cleared that table only twice despite the 18% gratuity."
Negative	"For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, i was severely dissapointed!  Who serves the breast piece deboned.  The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the flavor.  Instead i got an overcooked dry and inedible breast.  I was starving so i forced myself to eat it by washing it down with lots of hot sauce.

I ordered the chicken dinner with 2 sides, collards and cabbage which were both good.  The cornbread pancake amuse was a nice starter as i waited 15 minutes for the chicken.  I certainly dont mind the wait but dont serve me a well done piece of chicken when i can pay a fraction and get better fried chicken at popeye's or churches.  i wont be back - yes it s possible they missed but you cant miss on fried chicken when that's one of your staples....it should be easy...like a layup for them...come on man!"
Negative	"Not sure why the glowing reviews as after ~ $40 for the basic exterior/interior + tip we found they weren't detailed oriented enough (sand from camping trip still in passenger footwells, random bug/mud splatters missed on side doors from hasty washing/wiping).

That said, I've definitely had worse and it's possible that you get a lot more when you get a couple steps up in service but we weren't ready to invest $200 on a shampoo without seeing the quality...and now don't plan to."
Negative	"This airport is just strange for such a destination.

1- Upon arrival we waited for a VERY VERY long time for luggage. I have no idea why. This is the longest I've ever waited to receive luggage in any air port I have ever traveled. It was like 45 minutes before anything came out. This is not acceptable. 

2- Why so many shuttles and trains to get around? Why not try to plan things to be in one location? Ticketing is in one building, terminals in another, and rental cars in a different spot not even at the airport. 

Upon leaving the area, again the several spots just to get to the terminal. Going to the rental car building, taking a bus to ticketing and check in, and once that happens a train to the terminal. It is silly and wasted time. 

Upon check-in the security line was slow and a long line. Glad we arrived super early.

These are all why this place is rated down."
Negative	spirit sucks ass. seriously. delayed 2 hours for a 45 minute flight from LAS to LAX with no warning or accomodations. not even an email notifications. People at desk are no help. you get what you pay for and less. never ever ever ever again. ever.
Negative	The worst tacos I have ever put in my mouth. They were cold and tasteless. I have no idea why this place is still even open. They need to go to phoenix to get some lessons on how to make a good tasting taco. For $5 I expected for these tacos to close my mind! I barely swallowed them down, I only finished eating them because I paid over $20 for it. I'd pass on this place if I were you.
Negative	"Never again! We flew into Charlotte and had 45 min. To catch the next flight on our trip, which we knew. We're in our 60's and the next gate was at the furthest end of the B concourse. We arrived at E and had a hard walk to reach our next gate on time. When we got there, we found our flight delayed by an hour and a half because the flight crew wasn't expected from CHICAGO until 6:45 or so. Needless to say, we're PISSED. 

    YOU GOT US ONCE US AIR, NEVER AGAIN.
YOU'RE OVERPRICED AND SERVICE SUCKS."
Negative	"Things were going pretty well.  I like to swim, a lot.  I average 1.5k or more 3 to 4 times per week.  I was not made aware of the time exceptions for the pool when I signed up a couple of months ago. 
  They posted new times today.  They have a kiddy pool swim team.  I've been there many times where the kids just don't show up.  The kids that run the program are hacks.  After one' no show' program, they did us a favor and opened the lanes.  
  This is on top of the restrictions to accommodate pool exercise classes scheduled for adults.  They could easily fit thoses classes in 1 or 2 lanes, but the pool is closed for all but those attending. 

I really hope I get a call to discuss this with a district manager, I won't talk to the location manager."
Negative	Had noodle soup in the restaurant section.  The soup was OK but it was hard getting past the stagnant aquarium smell wafting in from the grocery area.  Interesting place but I probably won't be going back to eat here.
Negative	"Ok, so I this place could be pretty cool, with some changes.
I will start with the positive.
Our tour guide was lovely, and nice, and informative, so that was nice, and she can only work with what she is given. No complaints there.
The mansion seemed to be decorated very well, and lots of thought put into the scene.
I went on Halloween, so got there before they opened, couldnt park til 12:45.
We all lined up and were on the tour by 1:15/30 ish.
We got the locals discount, and paid 38 bucks each. Which feels like a lot, but hoped for the best.
So, our group included 16 people, one of which was in a wheelchair (this is point, because a wheechair needs room to move around)
The rooms are super tiny, and there are seemingly 100 of them, and trying to fit 16 people, a wheechair and a zillion objects into a tiny room isnt a recipe for a good time.
We were all crammed into each room, and given a very short amount of time to listen to the tour guide, yet no time (or room) at all, to actually see what was there. 
I would have loved a minute to actually see what she was talking about, instead of the back of peoples heads. 
That went on in every room, except the hallways, which were super dark, so you really couldnt see any of the cool decorations, unless you were crammed up against the wall waiting for everyone to get out of the room and into the next.
Its TOO DARK. The circus area was so dark, I couldnt see where I was stepping, and almost missed a couple of stairs. As someone else mentioned, the smoke machines are out of control. We both had a headache after inhaling it non stop. I get the need for a spooky vibe, but the smoke isnt necessary- or at least at the level its at. It also made it even harder to see.
 Maybe 1/3 of it would be sufficient. 

I feel that this could be great, but with people paying 40+ per ticket, the max size of the group could definitely be half of what we had, so that you can experience what is there.
To me, the tour felt like I stood in line for over an hour, and was rushed in and out of rooms, without actually seeing anything.
Side note: I have no idea of what ADA compliance rules are, but the wheelchair couldnt get into a few of the rooms. And ramps would be a good idea if the dark/fog thing is going to continue, because I heard 4 other people say that they almost fell on the stairs in the circus room area. 
With changes, this could be very enjoyable. As is, I wanted to leave. Just sayin."
Negative	"In today's buffet, okra Masala has too much salt. It would be good if chef tastes after cooking.
Service was awesome and way of treating customer is really appreciated. But the core of restaurant is food."
Negative	This was a difficult experience. Everyone had great food except me. My pork chop was so dry and over cooked it was difficult to cut with a steak knife. I showed the server how difficult it was to cut. The manager came to talk to me and offered to bring me something else when we were leaving. I turned down the offer of course, knowing from past experience that cooks are not always kind with a reorder. She was quick to laugh and inform me that that only happens in the movies. Really? You would stand and call a customer a lier? Ridiculous!
Negative	Went a couple days ago and when I got home I noticed clear coat scratches all over my hood, roof,and bumper. And on top of the the car was barley even cleaned. Payed $25 to have at least a total of 45 different scratches on my car. Then tried to say it wasn't them when I went back. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR THIS. YOU COST ME MORE MONEY THEN I SPENT AT YOUR HORRIBLE EXCUSE OF A CAR WASH.
Negative	"My friend sent me a snap of his food, a few days ago and I was just speechless.
I guess they tried to cover up this nasty chicken with out of pocket seasoning like they was Chef Ramsey. Wow. I guess this was just not cooking right? Let's torch the chicken and serve it to a human being. His kids wouldn't even touch the food."
Negative	"I ate here just because of the convenience factor, but the food was way overpriced and very dry. Also, the bus boy spilt scalding hot coffee over my hand and the table and didn't say anything. He came back with a few napkins and placed them on the table and didn't clean it up. Manager wasn't much help and didn't really do anything. If I was the manager, I would of made the meal complimentary and apologized profusely. 

Luckily the waiter was a decent guy so I still gave a decent tip. I wouldn't recommend this place to any friends and the customer service needs some work."
Negative	For a 4 1/2 star establishment I am appalled by their lack of etiquette. Assuming that my sister did not speak Vietnamese, a male nail tech rudely commented that her 3 year old daughter was not pretty in the face. Totally unacceptable to make a comment like this and especially towards a child! It should be common knowledge not to make rude comments about people in general but for paying customers? Wow.
Negative	We placed an order 5 small sub sandwiches for carry out.  I was told it would be 30 minutes.  We arrived after 30 minutes had passed. I was told it would be a couple more minutes so I took seat.  I watched a couple people get their orders so I thought I would be next.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I pondered walking out.  When I stood up I was told a told it was a few more minutes. After 30 minutes of additional waiting, it was ready. The subs were average.  Needless to say I won't be here again....my time is valuable.
Negative	"Alta Vista Apartments. My grandmother lives here and I've been here several times. Overall, it is an older building and it still needs a lot of work, but the little gnome that runs it doesn't want to do anything. He maybe shows up three days out of the week and spends three hours a day here if,  he is even here. He mostly plays golf and that's about it. The place is literally falling apart. The dumpster looks like it is about to fall out the bottom when the garbage truck lifts it up, and the back of the apartments are covered in dead leaves and nails, and the back patios, they are SUPER small probably 4 by 4 feet. The wood paneling on the back is infested with termites and the roof tends to leak quite frequently. The complex does have a pool, that the owner doesn't care of, and the lawn chairs are torn up and rusty, and do not have cushions.
There is also a workout room that has just a few pieces of old equipment. There is also a clubhouse that has new carpet, ripping sofas and an old pool table. And some of the neighbors are weird. In your apartment, you can hear your neighbors making extremely loud noise. They also have a shuffle board court and a mini golf course but they are both covered in palm frawns and dead leaves which make these areas unusable. There are also scattered piles of leaves and trash throughout the complex. Also, quite frequently kids come through and vandalize the lamp posts, as well as other things. So overall if you were thinking about moving in, I highly recommend you change your mind. DO NOT move in!"
Negative	"The usual selection/quality from other places - no better, no worse.

The only thing that bothered me was that there was a customer who had finished getting her cupcakes and began talking with the staff member about shit unrelated to the transaction that just occurred... (""my kids are starting school, blah, blah, blah....) while others waited in line - for at least 1 min!

I understand there are lonely whack jobs with bad marriages that want to talk to anyone to feel wanted or part of society, but the staff member should have excused themself from the customer and served the people waiting."
Negative	"The $5 hot and ready we grabbed for a quick dinner was lacking in sauce (literally none on it at all)...but did come with an added bonus of matted long black hair baked into the bottom of our crust. 

Yeah...seriously...feeling multiple strands of hair literally ripping in my mouth when I take a bite is about as disgusting as I've ever experienced. 

This is the last time we will ever visit this location...and probably the last time I'll have pizza for a while. Appetite ruined."
Negative	If you are looking for a place with great wings this is the place to go but only if you want them with a side of awful service. Food doesn't come out in a timely fashion, it comes out at all different times, wing flavors are wrong, aren't able to get drinks because they are too busy, asking for a glass of water seems to be a struggle for them as well. If you tell then the wing flavor is wrong they will tell you you are wrong and then become combative with you  (I'm talking ownership and management). One of the worst experiences I have ever had with customer service.
Negative	"I goto McD's twice a year. Shamrock shake and McRib. This year I added a 3rd trip during the BOGO offer for the new Quarter Pounders.

Drive thru here offers two lanes to order that converge into one for pickup. Drivers beware. Many drivers leaving the DriveThru also U-turn into the parking area on the East side, so it's probably not a great place to park - and you take your life into your hands if you are trying to leave the Wal-mart via that passageway.

We found the new habanero QP to be fairly tasty, with a giant slice of tomato and the sauce was actually decent, with some spice to it. Not hot, but hotter than I expected from McD. I was gonna give them 3 stars for the fact that I was pleasantly sursprised.

Then, I remembered that my previous trip here they didn't have shamrock shakes. They were out. Like 3 days into the limited time promotion. Back to two stars."
Negative	"Came here twice over the summer and sat on the patio - really great looking patio but BEWARE of the bees!! They don't leave you alone at all. I would request for a table away from flowers if possible. The bees do take away from the dining experience unfortunately. 

I've had the Korean short rib tacos and the almond crusted chicken tenders and both options were average. The tacos definitely sound better than it tastes and I found myself very underwhelmed after reading reviews from other Yelpers. The meat wasn't as juicy it flavorful as j had hoped. The chicken tenders is an interesting item with it being covered in almonds - you definitely taste a bit of the almonds but overall is no different from regular chicken fingers. 

The best part of the restaurant is the friendly servers - A+"
Negative	I always try to space my visits to this location to in hopes that the service gets better. Sadly it never does. I wish management or the owners would realize how much potential this location has. I won't be coming back unless something big happens that turns this place around. Wishing the best of luck!
Negative	"Like many others are saying on here, the food is good and consistent, it is a chain, we know what to expect. My issue is with their service, take-out service, and in particular, last night 3/4/2018 around 6:00pm. 

I called in about 5:15pm with a small take-out order, they said it would be 45 minutes, not ideal, but hey, I get it. I showed up at the time they told me 5:55pm, I was then told it would be an additional 15-20, it was an additional 25 minutes. Let me say again, things happen, they were a bit short handed. As the saying goes, ""it is not the crime that gets you in trouble, it is the cover-up"", let me explain. 

They were busy and short handed, got it, but the service and attitude at the restaurant just made everything worse. While waiting for my order, there were numerous customers that were in various states of aggravation over the situation, from the long wait issues to wrong orders and just plain appathey by the staff. There was a girl working who appeared to be trying to expedite orders, while I was waiting for my order she was busy checking her phone and even hanging out with some friends or family that brought her some type of gift card. There was another young lady working the register who felt it necessary to share her thoughts and comments about other customers with her Pei Wei counterparts. If a restaurant is going to have an open kitchen concept with everything exposed to the public, you better be a bit more disciplined than Pei Wei showed last night. 

Pei Wei should consider themselves fortunate that there is not another Chinese food restaurant close to them, or they would be relegated to the scrap heap of other poorly executed strip mall eateries."
Negative	Came here because  of the good reviews. .. but me and my husband were totally disappointed we both got soggy tostadas. The ceviche had no flavor. Oh and we had our son with us the server didn't  even ask if we wanted a drink  for him. Just bad service and food. First and last time going.
Negative	"I had a very bad experience with rude staff. :( I visited for the first time during lunch on a weekday. We walked up to the counter and asked if we could see their slices. She snapped back as us, saying they're not like Ian's. I have never been to Ian's... 

Once we got that all behind us, we ordered a slice from the MENU, and it was pretty fab. The crust was the perfect crispiness, though a little dry, and the sauce had great flavor. Unfortunately, it might take me a while to muster up the courage to give Roman another stab..."
Negative	Terrible service. The waitresses were downright rude. I don't know if it's because we're not Spanish speakers but seriously the service is pitiful. Food was good- but not good enough to deal with this. We will absolutely not be back.
Negative	management is rude and a bull to his employees.  I came two minutes late no one acknowledged me.  then told the receptionist oh she can wait. I will not be back
Negative	If I could give this place no stars I would. Worse experience ever. Security is harassing and unforgiving.  My boyfriend is middle eastern and from the moment we got in the club the security assumed he was doing something wrong? I saw as the guard physically pushed my boyfriend and ripped his shirt off leaving scratch marks on his back for no reason. When I asked to file a formal complaint I was told we would be arrested. So now I'm on yelp making a complaint here.... How are you suppose to feel safe in a club like that?
Negative	Do not get your car washed here. It doesn't work. It literally stopped working mid-wash - there was only a small trickle of water. Tried calling for a refund and only found a fax number. Avoid this car wash.
Negative	"This ROSS location is disgusting.  I almost turned around and walked out but wanted to check for an item that I've been looking for. I felt like I was at a garage sale. Clothes were thrown all over the floor, babies crying everywhere, kids on the loose, and people throwing stuff wherever it landed as though they were raised in a barn. 
Where the heck were the employees to clean up....a little, at the least. I understand it must be hard to keep up on it considering, but it was nasty. 
I will not be back. 
At least the woman at the waiting room was friendly and nice."
Negative	"This specific Subway was very dirty the tables needed to be wiped and the floors needed to be swept.  A herd of children came in while we were eating and they were all given free cups and all stood in front of the soda dispenser blocking paying customers. 

The sandwich makers seemed to be more interested in something going on in the back of the store and all the kids that were coming in than they were of paying customers.  I would not visit this store again."
Negative	"I took my car in for a detailing and ended up out $200 and with a dirty car...not even completely cleaned much less detailed.  

After purchasing a pre-paid detailing a few months ago, I gook my car in yesterday. Having had good service in the past, I accepted an offer from the overly aggressive sales guy on an upgrade to polish the headlights, clay bar the finish and do a 'deep cleaning' of the wheel wells.  

Three hours later, I called (they failed to call me when it was done) and arrived to pick up my car.  The attendant gave me my key and said ""The mats are in the trunk""...and that was it.  

I found a car with the hood ornament broken and kinked to the side (I was able to fix it myself), brake dust remaining all over the wheels and brake calipers, bug remains all over the front grille, hood and elsewhere and a film and spots (not armour all) all over the interior wood. 

IT WASN'T EVEN CLEAN MUCH LESS DETAILED.  

After this level of service, I will not be returning.  I will either have my mechanic detail it or I will do it myself.

As a final note, take positive reviews with a grain of salt.  They have a standing offer: positive reviews will get you a free car wash.  Guess I won't get one of those."
Negative	"You really gotta mess up to get one of these ratings from me but I've given up on these guys and all of their locations. After wasting $200 at this place, there's really no reason to return, for any aspect. The food, service, and atmosphere have all declined. Hopefully I can keep you from making the same mistake also.

The last time we were at this location was probably four or five months ago and things seemed OK. Since then, they've taken a nose dive and they're heading for a crash landing. Things were bad from the start when the super personable woman up front greeted us first with, ""how many?"" After tallying the head count at 13, she asked ""how many drinks?"" I was about to say 13, but stopped and asked if they were free and she said they weren't and were $1.50 each. What buffet does that crap for soft drinks?

The Mongolian grill is gone. They sushi stand was ransacked and looked like I fell into after drinking a 12 pack. They time stamp the sushi and saw some pieces that were there since 3:30 PM and it almost 8 when we were there. Pretty much all of the food was old and dried out with no attempt to replace any of it. Their one saving grace has been their crab legs, but my wife gave up on them after one trip because they were overcooked with no meat. My brother-in-law didn't finish his meal because he was getting an upset stomach from eating the chicken wings. Service was terrible for a buffet. Thirteen people are gonna go through plates pretty quick and they were piled up like we were having a tower building contest.

I could go on and on, but I'm not going to waste my time or yours writing, or even uploading photos. Just trust if you look at my rating distribution, no business gets this unless they truly deserve it."
Negative	"Food:3
Service:1

The location was nice. When we joined our party we quickly realized that only two of the 8 of us had menus. We waited for a bit to see if someone would come with more but ended up sharing the two. From that point on the service was disappointing. I sat with an empty drink for about 15 minutes before I could get someone's attention to get me another. The service staff seemed disinterested in being attentive. Each one of our party had a similarly disappointing experience. I wouldn't bother going back again. This was indeed unusual compared to other local restaurants. 

The food was OK. I would expect more for the prices."
Negative	So I used to really love this place but every time I have gone in it has just gotten worse and worse as you can see I ordered a turkey bacon avocado only to get no avocado and very little bacon and tomato. I'm pretty disappointed as I love this sandwich and it's a shame I won't be going back everyone knows avocado is expensive but this is another level of cheap. The saving grace was the free strawberry but even those have gotten smaller and smaller each time I come. I guess it's time to go to panara bread instead.:/
Negative	Very long wait time and no return calls from Nurse when you leave a voicemail.  The pharmacy requested a different prescription for days via phone and fax, as I did. Call your patients back.
Negative	this place has been to my apartment, i'm going to say, over 10 times since i moved in back on the 13th of october. as soon as we signed the lease and went to move things into our apartment, we noticed we had a roach problem. i moved here from pennsylvania, so maybe i'm not understanding the protocol for roaches (it's more of a stink bug problem in pennsylvania), but Burns comes here often and we STILL have the problem. the apartment has been fogged several times and they've used some kind of spray. we even have sticky traps, in which are always full. we're super clean; i literally vacuum and mop at least two times a day. i don't understand how this problem has not been taken care of.
Negative	I asked for a quote on 33x12.5.18 tires. They were all confused and told me this is an odd size. I pulled up a quick search on my phone and showed them. The guy took my phone to some dude in the garage area, he they still could not find the tire. What a joke, tire engineers seriously?
Negative	"Don't go!  Don't go!  I was there last night and was charged $20 for 2 pina coladas that I swear were virgin lada nothing.  I could of had my own bottle of rum for $20.  Sorry guys, you are not a place that makes drinks worth that much.  I would pay it when it is worth it, but this was a regular sized pina colada glass and all coconut milk which I believe is $1.20/can at a store and they probably get it in balk; I am just saying.  My table ordered the big $58 feast that we saw was on sale, but we were charged full price.  I believe that was a difference of $10 or just about that.  I guess looking at us, we must have screamed ""has $ to throw away"", I work for my dollars and for hard working people, it is not fair to be ripped off.  Look out your windows, there was no cars in your parking lot on a Friday night.  We should have seen the sign, but instead we tried your mafia front restaurant and ""NO"" we did not like your mystery sauce that was not listed on the menu.  I believe we were supposed to get grilled seafood, not boiled in old tomatoes to hide the old fish smell prawns and such.  Its Christmas, do you think everyone has money to just hand over to you guys?  The service was great; until our waitress left before we were done eating.  

The worst was my vegetarian friend, for her bean burrito turned into everything they had to get rid of in a can.  Good thing she was given a dull steak knife to cut her canned vegetable- ""where are the beans"" burrito."
Negative	"I love Carls Jr, but the hamburger was put together sloppy. When did they start using square buns?? And to top it off it was stale. Brought it back and got a round  bun, but that didn't help the experience. Just couldn't eat any more and dumped my meal in the trash. 
The soda fountain was running out of several sodas. They looked like were short handed, but there was an elderly employee taking her break in the eating area. 
This place was much better than before, but it has gone the tubes. Scratch this location off my list. Adios!!"
Negative	"this was the worst move ever.
they did not wrap my things correctly, they broke my office furniture to the point it must be replaced.  I started with 7 book cases and now I have 3 because of the breakage. 
their professionals rode our bikes into and out of the truck and managed to break one of those too.  when their truck broke down with 3 ice chests the frozen cow that was in them was ruined.  we asked them to put the ice chests in last thing so we could remove them first thing and stick them in the freezer.  well they put them in the front buried under all our stuff. my grandma's antique dresser has scratches and gouges on it that we cant even figure out how they did that! 
when they put our stuff in storage they placed the heavy thing on the top with fragile boxes at the bottom. all boxes were clearly marked.  they dropped our desk top computer then wrapped it in our comforter and told us it was ok.  it will be fine.  when they left the storage facility they managed to hit the fence in front of the facility and decided to try to exit the back way.  in doing so they managed to hit the block wall.  the next day when they unloaded the truck that broke down the manager came and asked them for their insurance info due to the damage.  they became so belligerent and abusive on the phone (speaker phone) and showed their true colors.  it was one of the most awful and degrading experiences I have ever witnessed.  
the lack of professionalism shown insured that I will never use or recommend this company to anyone.  at $200 / hour I expected a certain level of professionalism and did not receive it.  the workers asked for alcohol, food and tips.  tips?  really?  with all the damage they caused they should be grateful I am not pressing charges on each of them!  never again.  I will never use them again.  I would not recommend them to anyone for anything."
Negative	"Sometimes I wonder how some places stay in business and this is one of them. The inside is due for a makeover it's dark in there. The place seemed dirty to me and needs a deep cleaning as well. On to the food we ordered the shabu shabu the broth had no taste what so ever it was so bland it was like drinking plain hot water. After adding the vegetables and the meats still tasted the same after the second tiny bowl of this tasteless food I told my wife I had enough!!!

When we got the check the check holder cover was so dirty and sticky I got disgusted. I didn't even touch it..place needs help!

Went to Rocco's got two slice of pizza and was happy!!"
Negative	The place looks great, service was good, disappointed though poor value, I ordered the wedge and steak, my wife's scallop was larger than my steak no joke, $20 bucks , if it was some prime fillet ok but really,
Negative	This place is awful, their prices are too high and they have terrible customer service. They are always behind the counter talking amongst themselves and like to pretend they know something about hookah, which in fact, they don't. Your can go to the olive tree on the brook park extension and find hookah tobacco for half the price of what this wannabe head shop wants to charge. Also, terrible selection on product. I have given them two chance and both times were a disappointment.
Negative	Bummed that I didn't have a good first impression.  Ordered the Bahn? Chicken sandwich. The chicken was super dry and tasteless.  The roll is a plain white sub roll. Not even a good one. May give it another shot. The salads looked good. It is pricey too.
Negative	"Would caution anyone using their services to ask how much they plan to charge. On a recent trip I was told of a $57 fee before hand. When they arrived the tech mentioned a diagnostic fee (which i assumed was the $57) and looked at the problem. 

AFTER he had looked at the problem I was presented papers saying there was an additional charge of $155 (to tell me there was a leak). To me that is just ripping people off. I was never told of that dollar amount until AFTER the tech looked at the problem. 

I called the General Manager Paul Stefano. He basically said I was a liar and that the tech told me it would be $155 BEFORE he looked at the problem. Why would I agree to pay someone $155 to tell me about a leak i knew about?  I wasn't told about the fee until afterwards. He claimed the signed bill proves the tech told me about the fee BEFORE he diagnosed it, but that is not true. There is no time stamp to demonstrate that and again I wouldn't pay someone $155 to tell me there was a leak, I thought I was paying the $57 for that. 

I'm sure the work they do is decent, but my experience was not good. My conversation with Paul was very poor and would not expect that tone from a Manager of a Company."
Negative	"We were on vacation in Pittsburgh and decided to try this out. It's hard to find things to do when your kids are 2.5 and 13.5 respectively. Bought a Groupon that, with a coupon code, was very reasonably priced. There are some bouncy houses that the younger loved and the older and I were having fun skating until I tried this one slide that wasn't a straight shoot. I went flying and landed on my right leg, hard, and ended up in the ER the next night with severe bruising and swelling.

Therein lies the problem: the website says that each skater is assigned a trainer they work with until they're comfortable. Our trainer said, ""Do you know how to skate? Just squat a little and push off."" Literally, that was the extent of the ""training."" No info on how to stop or on which ramps were more advanced. No one recommended knee and elbow pads or even asked if we wanted them. And then none of the people who work there were even in the skating area observing. Ditto the bounce house area. And this was on a Saturday night!

When I fell, my stepdaughter asked for ice and they handed her one of those emergency ice packs you squeeze to activate. No one asked her how I was, if I needed assistance, etc. 

When we were leaving I offered feedback about having trainers advise on skill level of ramps or at the very least explaining how the curved ones required different skills. They were like, ""Oh, thanks, hope you feel better."" And that's it. No real concern. 

So I'm giving it two stars because it was fun until I wiped out, and it was great to have a place that both kids enjoyed. If we'd been better trained, or I'd been advised that beginners shouldn't use certain ramps, or I'd been asked about knee pads, I wouldn't have ended up in the ER and I might be writing a different review. 

But there is an alarming lack of safety concern in a place that caters to kids, and that's not okay. Especially not since the website claims it's a super safe activity. It's not. Let your kids play here at your own risk."
Negative	Slow. Almost all drink options were out in the machine and cashier knew about it.  Have to get napkins from counter, waited five minutes after going back for napkins and restaurant was not very busy.
Negative	I dont know why they let this place get so rundown, but wow. Filthy bug infested rooms, peeling wallpaper, dirty linen. And i paid for an upgrade. The casino is an absolute disaster, incredibly uncomfortable and manned by the rudest employees you can imagine. It really was a nice hotel once, but now there are plenty of less expensive hotels that put it to shame. See Penn and Teller there, but then trust me, sleep somewhere else.
Negative	"Tonight my boyfriend and I went out to celebrate Valentine's Day since I was out of town last week. We wanted to try this place out because we drive past it all the time. Well it went down hill from the beginning. The host acted surprised that we walked in. It wasn't busy at all and we stood there with her writing something on a paper for about 3 mins before she walked us to the table. The restaurant was small but nice. We sat at the table for about 5 mins before some girl who never introduced her self or welcomed us to Roys said ""ice water or bottled.""  We then sat there and other 5 min before a different male server dropped the water off. He did seem friendly either and walked away. We were so confused on who our server was. After sitting for a total of 15 mins before anyone came to take an order. There was about 5 other tables in the whole restaurant, not busy at all. Then finally the girl who took our water order came by and asked if we were ready to order (later found out her name was Nicole when we cashed out.) We asked if the meals were a la Carte because the menu was a bit confusing and she replied the meal comes with a veggie and a starch. When we ordered she didn't even mention what our meals came with. We ordered the calamari to start with. That was delicious. We were barley checked on. I know it was towards the end of the night but that doesn't count for poor service. Our meal came out about 20 min later. The meal was good but disappointing. The server did not know her menu. I only received a veggie and my boyfriend only received a starch when we were told we would receive both. They poured sauce all over my steak that was not mentioned on the menu which ruined the flavor of the steak. Would have been better if they put the sauce on the side. The food was good. I wouldn't say excellent, my boyfriend can grill better then what we had, but the service was awful. No one was friendly, or trying  to give us a WOW experience. When you go out to eat it's the atmosphere and the food that your paying for and it was the worst dining experience I have ever been too. The night was a loss and has put my boyfriend in a horrible mood that he wasted his money on that. We will never be returning or recommending this place to any family or friends. Spending ur money at McDonalds would have been a better night."
Negative	"Had their chicken thigh and leg combo today for $10.25. Where do I begin? First off, the chicken looked like it was in mutant form...definitely not ontario grade quality. The batter was very bland and had no flavour whatsoever. Judging from the positive yelp reviews, I thought I was in for a treat - not a science experiment taste test. One yelper said the chicken was on par with popeyes or kfc....dude - you are definitely as kookoo as the chicken and the same goes for the rest of you. May the flavour gods be with your taste buds.

This was pure highway robbery - definitely will not be returning."
Negative	"*** I can't review on the food because I didn't eat ***
But we met some friends there around 8pm on a Saturday night. They were sitting out back and having dinner and drinks. The band started playing about 10 minutes later. Once the band started playing, it was to loud to talk to anyone ( which I get is common with bands but it's wasn't pleasant). Our server dropped off waters and then disappeared.  Lastly, I walk up to the bar to order a cider and the bartender was trying to tell me about the different types of ciders they have but, it was so loud I couldn't hear her.  She gave me the one on draft, it came in a little 12oz plastic cup. Once I got the bill, they charged me $6.50 for that little glass of cider.  So in the end, this place is really loud, has bad service, and the drinks are expensive. I won't return."
Negative	I really wanted to like this place - I looked at the menu online and looked like I would enjoy most things - it is also close to my work.   Alas, I didn't even get to try the food.    I was greeted when I walked in.  I was handed a menu and told to pick my own seat and that they would be right over.   (this was at 12:45, some tables were occupied, but mostly not busy)   I waited for 10 minutes and no one approached - it was like I was invisible.  They went around to other tables.  I tried to make eye contact and got nothing.  So, I left.  Not even a good bye or wait sorry.   I love to support local, but I can't support you if you ignore me.
Negative	I have gone there before and it was okay. Just went there tonight and ate a steak that looks like it was raw and just sat under a heating lamp. The steak was cold and more red than the coolaid man. They gave me another steak 10 min later and proceeded to charge me, even though I didn't eat the new steak. Establishments like this, that are considered primers steakhouses, should comp steaks that come out looking like a red gusher candy.
Negative	horrible service, horrible people.. I've gone here multiple times, for 80% of them to never have my food arrive on time, be done on time, sometimes even gets canceled 20 mins after ordering.. very poor
Negative	"I hate it when I finish a meal and feel as though I have wasted my money.  I had high hopes for a restaurant that specializes in BBQ, and had expected a tasty meal, since there is so much BBQ competition in this city.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food, and was not impressed with the service.

My BF and I went on a Thursday night for dinner at 7pm and it was dead, although it did pick up as we were leaving.  The tables and BBQ sauce bottles were greasy and had dried food on them, and the table we were sat at was next to the drain pipe for the AC, not ideal.  In terms of the food, the price is certainly right for the portion size, and we ended up taking a lot of food home.  Here is a run down of what we ordered...

1/2 chicken - I am positive this came out of the microwave.  I heard the distinctive beep of a microwave, and the chicken was lava hot in the middle as I dug in, with limp and soggy skin and very dry meat, that I needed a swig of beer to help me swallow.

St. Louis ribs - A good size portion for a 1/2 rack but very greasy and fatty.  Seems to be very poor quality meat, and the rub is not very flavourful and tasted mostly like black pepper.  

Sauces - their ""go-to"" BBQ sauce, as the server described it, was thick and grainy without much of a punch of flavour to it.  The best of all the sauces is the sesame mayo which I put on all of my sides.

Sides - A very large portion, and the waffle fries and potato salad were yummy, I filled up on these.  The collard greens were not bad but I had expected more flavour from the description in the menu, and the coleslaw was way too vinegary.  

CHEAP BEER ON THURSDAYS is the only good thing I can say about this experience.  Coors and Canadian are only $3.50 a bottle!!!

I would say try somewhere else....I hope this  helps."
Negative	Worst service ever at Blue 32. The bartender spills a full glass of water on my wife.  It happens. Cell phone and purse saved. We stay, although my wife feels like she is wearing a diaper. I order food and a drink and the same bartender forgets the food order. We finally give up. Guess we'll grab something on the way home. Thanks for nothing. U Blew It 32.
Negative	I LOVE my peanut butter cup smoothie and I've never had to wait in line. Every time I go there they are bumping my music however, as a business, I think they should have better music. The few times that I've been to this one I notice that they are way under staffed and people are in this long line out the door! People are starting to leave because it is taking so long. As mentioned above, I've never waiting, but as a business you should definitely have more than ONE employees working. I only go to this one because it is closer to home.
Negative	"This week I hosted a team dinner at Buca. So straight away I tried to call the restaurant 3 times today to express my concern about the quality of our dinner to honestly avoid a less than average Yelp review. On the first phone menu option it just rang fast busy. Second menu option put me on hold for a few minutes and then I was notified the subscribers mailbox was full - so here we go.

Love the restaurant, the ambiance is fun, and have always had good meals here. This week the food was so subpar. Our server (Joshua) was great - no complaints here at all. And because this was a work dinner I was not going to cause any issues with bringing up the food quality with my team present. 

Management team - if you want to reach out to me directly for specifics please do so. Again my interest is not to publicly criticize here - I am just interested in providing feedback to help address our issues. 

Thank you,
Bryan"
Negative	"ZZZZZZzzzzzzZZZZZzzzz oh sorry was I snoring. I fell a sleep thinking about this place. 

ok let me say a few good things. first the food while expensive is good. good selection much better then most arenas. I do enjoy Burkies Dog house.  real sports bar is good if you can get in before the game. lots of brews on tap and lots of huge tvs. Also the huge tv on the outside of the arena is very cool.

ok thats all the good stuff I have to say now on to what really matters in a NHL arena atompshere. the place is a grave yard. the Suits that fill up these seats have no life what so ever... not that you can blame them the team on the Ice doesnt exactly give you much to cheer for. If you try to make some noise you quickly get sushed either by a suit on his blackberry or by an uptight ussher. Its a Hockey game people!!! you want to talk buisness go to the office.

honestly I hate this place. Wayyyy over priced and its no fun.  Oh and the Leafs suck!"
Negative	My friend raved about this place so I tried it when I was in the area. The service was sloooow. The food was just okay. And the music was too loud. I've never had chicken and waffles and was expecting something a little more unique that what I can prepare at home. Did I mention the service was slow?? I don't think I'd choose to go back here again on my own. Only if a friend begged me to.
Negative	"Brandie S. Go to plus one grooming!! Awesome place!
That's where I go, I don't take my precious furry kid to an unprofessional grooming place like pet smart. That's a shame!  You would think you could trust them ! That's their business!!"
Negative	They are bs and silly .... Now no doubt that they have all the luxury designers I'm not taking that away from them but they customer service sucks so much ass it's pitiful once I bought my very high price perfume they immature non professional customer service attitude started and they prices!!!! Honnnneyyy they so lucky I was in a rush and really wanted what I wanted and could afford it because I tell you now if you want a certain brand of perfume right in that moment go to MACYS!!! got home checked my perfume price online on Macy's and it was $30 less !! GO TO MACYS IN THE MALL!!!!
Negative	The food here is simply disappointing, and leaves you feeling gross after you've eaten it.  It all tastes very processed, not fresh.  It may be inexpensive, but clearly you get what you paid for (or less).
Negative	So to get things started they play the same playlist every night. My poor friend has to listen to this average music as she rests her weary head each night. Second: these weak cheerleader bartenders are slower than my grandma who can't walk and never want to serve us all the alcohols. Just trying to get crunk with my friends!!! LET ME GET LIT. Third: we ordered Miller lite beers (triple hops brewed) and they finessed us and gave us BUSH LITE!!! Im sorry what???? Not what I ordered??? I thought this was America. I feel so cheated. I cannot even believe what is happening to me right now
Negative	"I would have given them less than one star but you cant on Yelp.

This is by far the worst car buying experience I have ever had.

I found a 2009 Murano that I liked and arranged for a test drive via email after requesting their special E-Price. The sales person ""Chris"" emailed me a price and so I went to look at it. The car was nice but the paint was in very rough shape. I had a vehicle that I needed to trade in so we started the negotiation. We hit a sticking point on the sale when he wanted me to pay $1500.00 for paint protection and they were about $2000 short on my trade. I told him I needed to think about it and he told me to name my payment. I gave him a number and when he came back he told me that they were going to give me full price for my trade and remove the paint protection.

I was extremely happy because it was going to make my payment lower than expected. When I looked at the initial sales write up, none of it was true. The payment amount still reflected the $2k deficiency in my trade and the paint protection. I was then told by ""Chris"" that he had spoken out of turn and I needed to give him a number to work with but they wouldn't budge on the car and they wouldn't budge on the trade but he may be able to lower my payment through the financing. I told him if he could get me to the payment I would take the car. He went back to the Manager and came back and said he got the payment within $10.00. I thought fair enough

Then came the finance manager ""Mark"". He wrote everything up. He offered me an extended warranty ( which I normally never do). He again said he could work with the finance company to keep my payment about the same. He came back and told me a few additional months and $8.00 extra dollars and I would have the best warranty they offered 2 years, 24000 miles bumper to bumper. I agreed as that is about how long i figured I would own the car. Perfect ..right??

On my way out  ( mind you 4 hours after this started) ""Chris stopped me to ask if I had any additional keys to my trade. I told him I did and asked if they had an additional key FOB for my car. He said he didn't know but would look around and asked when I could drop off the additional key. I agreed to do it next day.

I arrived the next day with my extra key only to find that I was not going to get the same courtesy from Peoria Nissan. I was charged an additional $200.00 to have a new key programmed. I mean every car needs two keys..just in case right.

So some time goes ( about three weeks)..and I get a message from ""Mark"" stating my loan docs are in and I need to come down to sign them. So now I make my third trip down and wait for ""Mark"" and upon reviewing the loan docs realize there are some errors with my trade in. He tells me no worries that it will all get worked out internally. Ok sign away. I then get home and realize that I got taken.

Plus now two emails to their sales manager with no response even though they state that they really do value your feedback.

In summary this dealership will do and say anything they have to to get the sale.

So my next step will be a BBB complaint and maybe drop a line to the State Attorney General and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau...and hell if that doesn't work maybe I'll get a lawn chair and a sign and pickett their property for a few months. I'll update my post and let you know how it goes!! Thanks for reading

Update 12/10/14

So I had to file a BBB complaint to get their attention and it worked. I received a call stating they will refund the money for the key FOB and revise the contract to what was originally offered to me. I will however have to make an appointment to go back to the dealership and sign. I will update once this is done

Update 12/17/14

These guys are something else. Their "" Compliance Director"" responded to the BBB with more lies stating that they had made multiple appointments with me and a guy who I have never met. After calling them out on their lies I received a call from another  "" Manager"". I think everyone there is a Manager or Director. Laughable when you have to prop yourself up with a made up title. Anyway he has assured me that all of the issues have been resolved and he can see me today.

Update 12/17/14
Contract signed and promised a refund of the money for my key FOB. They were unable to cut me a check as they only had one signer and they need two. With all of the Managers running around that place you would think they could have pulled that off but whatever...I will once again give them the benefit of the doubt.

Update 12/26/14

Alas my end trust was unfounded. Almost 10 days later and still no refund. ""Sigh""

I guess we are back to the BBB. These guys are like the keystone cops. Maybe if they actually had a real customer service Manager or were really concerned about compliance these things wouldn't happen. Either way if you need a used vehicle and don't mind feeling dirty when you leave...this is the place for you. Otherwise run!!"
Negative	How many potheads does it take to screw in a light bulb? Hopefully not as many as it takes to make a sandwich. Walked in and was ignored at the register by all 7 (seven) people behind the counter for so long that I was unsure that was where I was even supposed to order so I asked a girl sweeping (also ignoring me) and she said that I was in fact to order at the register (surprise!) and she asked one of the geniuses behind the counter to help me out but when he finally realized I had been standing at the register he asked me why I hadn't called his attention over.. after this annoying exchange he asked for my name for the order and I sat by the pickup area for my food. because i was the literal only person who ordered in the restaurant it was pretty ridiculous they called out my food for a completely different name (not even slightly close to my name) like why did you ask for my name at all? The stoners they hire at this place should at least know how to handle their shit at work. Highest concentration of absolute space cadets in a single 500 foot radius.
Negative	"Hideous place.  Horrid.  I agree with Josh W's review.

I KNOW that this is a dollar store and don't expect five star service ...

A woman in front of me presented the clerk with a $20.00 bill.  The clerk examined the bill for at LEAST five minutes (long lineup of people behind me) and started going on about was it a real bill or not.  I tried to meditate and hoped that this thing would resolve itself.  Finally, it was determined that the bill was ""real"".  Really?  What a surprise.  If they are so paranoid about dud bills, why not get a damn machine to test?  What a wickedly nasty place.  Don't go there if you have options!!!!!!!"
Negative	I've been to alot of different autobell's in Charlotte, and I dont know why I thought this one would he any different. Spent 40 dollars on services and other than the outside of the car being washed by the machine nothing on the interior was cleaned. The car was already relatively clean since it was a rental car that I had only used for three days. I ended up going to walmart and purchasing my own cleaning supplies and spent the whole 10 minutes doing it myself. Dont go to autobell for a car wash unless you like to throw money away. People were friendly but who wouldn't smile at you when they are stealing your hard earned money.
Negative	"We just moved from SD, and wanted to take our son to see the new Disney Cars movie:) We decided to find an AMC rather than go to the Regal by our house because we're stubs members and we used to always go to AMC back home. Well we weren't big fans of this theatre. So many other reviewers love that they now have recliner seats and you can reserve your seats online too. That's awesome, but I don't think it should be the selling factor. 

We usually get a small water bottle for my sons kids pack, but my husband forgot this time and asked the girl if we could exchange the drink. The girl made this annoying sigh and asked her supervisor to do a refund out LOUD:/ My husband said it's ok, can we just get a water cup, and she said they don't have that. Really?? 
Then we notice a big mess by the soda machines, it was only 10:35am....anyways, we go in early to the theatre and the AC isn't on yet, plus my husband gets the nice surprise of melted chocolate stuck on his seat-.- So I think we might have to switch to Regal while we're here."
Negative	Please double check your receipts when returning items. I was charged instead of refunded for my items and had to go back to get a double refund to fix it all.
Negative	"Awful. The stroganoff was an overcooked slab of short rib next to noodles that tasted like canned mushroom soup with a spoonful of sour cream thrown into the plate. They said it was ""the chef's interpretation"" of stroganoff, although they comped it, which was very nice and appropriate. My husband's steak and lobster tail was very good, thank goodness. The lovely, romantic restaurant was closed off, and the only seating was at the bar blaring loud music. Not the romantic, tasty vision I had hoped for."
Negative	"My first flight was uneventful, with a kind and efficient flight crew. My second flight was another experience entirely. I have been flying many years and if I have learned one thing about air travel, it is that things go wrong. Flights are cancelled, delayed, passengers get rude, babies scream for hours, planes ice over, etc. I have rarely run into this but today I met a airline employee with 0 patience. Think a short Aubrey Plaza in Parks and Recreation, but with none of the funny.
It was a deeply unpleasant interaction. I hope her day gets better, but count me out for the future, Spirit."
Negative	Ordered they say debit at the door no they don't have it food is good owner is a prick called and was told oh well thanks for your money done with this prick.
Negative	Yuck! Terrible food, terrible service.  There was a group of 10 of us and no one enjoyed it. My 3 year old wouldn't even eat the food. The server brought over 2 drinks and had me sip both of them to tell him which one was a root beer and which was a coke and then gave them to my husband and mom. I was happy for the rest of yhe table that he managed to figure out the rest instead of having me taste test them all.  The food was tasteless and soggy, the deserts weren't even that great except for a bit of cake frosting and ice cream.  I will never go back. Ever.
Negative	I should have looked at the reviews before ordering from this company. I ordered  the wrong item because it was not worded  properly on their website. After receiving it I asked to return it. I was told that I would be charged for shipping both ways. I was also told that If I had looked at all the items they sold I would have noticed that the correct item cost more and since it was strictly my fault they wouldn't do anything for me. She said I should just keep the wrong product and order the right one.  I asked them to please talk to a supervisor to ask if they could waive some of the shipping cost. I never received a response. That is just poor customer service. I also found the same exact product for less on several other websites, so do your homework before ordering from them. I wish I did.
Negative	I should have read the reviews before I purchased the groupon. I never felt so uncomfortable. I came in to another customer arguing with the server about their groupon and right away I was worried because I was about to use the groupon. The servers were quite rude...they do not make your feel welcome and warn you asap that a 15% gratitude will be added to the groupon bills which is fine but the way they brought it up was not professional. The restaurant is out dated and quite dirty as a result I was worried about the food handling of the restaurant. The poke was alright not the best but not the worse. However, because of the service I would not come back.
Negative	"Awful. The receptionist had the worst attitude and tried to make me feel stupid for something THEY screwed up on. They also don't tell you that when you're sedated- you don't actually fall asleep for the procedure. If I had known that from the beginning, I would've gone somewhere else where I knew that I would be put under. 

The experience was much more awful than it needed to be. I do not recommend this place to any woman. You're better off anywhere else."
Negative	"Disheartening Results...Chose the Wrong Guy !!!

Porcelain Veneers---- Disappointing Results.
* Heavy, Thick, Poor Texture, Length-short
* No Gingival Symmetry with Smile
* 1st set of Veneers- Constant Pain, Sensitivity, and Irritation
* 6 weeks in temporary Veneers
* No Laboratory Wax-Up

When it comes to Cosmetic- Porcelain Veneers, Bill relies on his esthetic Ceramist (Jake-at Metrolina Dental Laboratory) to fabricate poor quality veneers. I had to have my veneers removed and redone twice where the final results were worse then the originals. 

Dental laboratories create veneers, dentures, crowns, bridges, orthodontic appliances, and other dental restorations like implant crowns. There is a huge difference in the quality of these labs. if you are like most dental patients, you have no idea which lab your dentist is using or the quality. This lack of information could cost you dearly. The ""lab"" may be more important than your dentist.

There are plenty of great Dentists in Charlotte."
Negative	Let's  start with Tiff the bartender. Over an hour at playing keno with a friend. My friend ordered a drink redbull and vodka within the first 15 min she was finished. We continued to play and when it was all said and done I'm leaving and Tiff tells me that the redbull she comped but the shot of vodka  I needed to pay for.  Now I'm no bar manager but how does one split a mixed drink into two bills. I don't understand and I'm not impressed  what so ever. Thanks Tiffany for making my experience there so amazing...
Negative	Worst philly steak ive had. People who cook should wear gloves. The cook at the tme i went to order my food kept answering his cell phone while cooking, very unsanitary. Will never come back to this place
Negative	"WOW, what happened to one of my favorite pizzas???  We have loved the pizza here for a few years but our experience last week was bad.  It was Saturday evening and we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table and they would text when our table was ready. No Problem, we walked around the Quarter.  50 minutes later (and no text) we came back to the front door and waited outside.  Looking inside, many tables were empty but full of dirty dishes.  After 1 hour and 10 minutes, I asked how the hostess about the approximate wait, she looked at the list and said ""I can seat you now""  When were they going to tell us???

She took us to a table that had a filthy tablecloth.  We asked for a clean table.  The waiter was nice and friendly.  Placed our order for a salad and a pizza.  After about 15 minutes, we asked if we could get the salad before the hot pizza and he said he would check on it.  5 minutes later he brought the salad and as soon as we started serving it, the pizza arrived.  He was nice enough to ask if we wanted a fresh pizza when we were finished with the salads.

When the pizza came out, it was drenched in tomato sauce and barely had any cheese. The other toppings were fine. BUT, Not what we have had in the past.  It was BAD!!!

Interestingly, we mentioned this experience to some friends that also frequent this Grimaldi's and they said when they were there about a week ago, they were very disappointed too."
Negative	"Terrible pretzels. Service with an attitude. I asked for a fresh pretzel and she told me no. I should've walked away but my child wanted one. It was the hardest, chewiest ""soft"" pretzel I've ever eaten. Hire someone with a work ethic who cares about the product they are serving and the customers they are serving it to. This was gross!"
Negative	"This is the worst gym on the planet. The facility is small and cramped, the classes are remedial, and the staff is extremely rude. My fiance and I printed the free 3-day passes from the internet to give the club a try. Upon entering the club one of the ""membership service reps"" took our drivers licenses and told us we would receive them on our way out. Great. 

Off I went to the step class... which was AWFUL. The instructor seemed like a sweet person but honestly she was tremendously out of shape and should not be teaching aerobics. Ugh. 

So after an hour of plodding through a low energy class we went to the front desk to retrieve our IDs only to be informed that we had to pay $15 each for taking trying the gym out. What? Um... why does  LAfitness.com  state that it is a free 3-day trial if they charge $15 a day? The front desk clerk attempted to hold our IDs hostage and extort $30 out of us. I literally  had to reach over the desk and grab the IDs off of the counter. The guy then claimed that if we didn't pay he was going to send us a bill or report it to the police because as he claimed ""it was like skipping out on a restaurant bill"". Um... not if you have a coupon for a FREE MEAL! Honestly this place is ridiculous!  I am shocked that the LA Fitness corporation would condone such unethical business practices. Whatever happened to customer service? So much for trying out this gym. 24 hour Fitness here we come."
Negative	Bland food. Nice people working there, though. They have gluten free beer, which is cool for those of us in that category. The sauces didn't really do anything for me. Hopefully you'll like it better.
Negative	"Well, Cure continues to receive awards and pop up on ""must eat"" lists so we felt like we had to give it another shot.  
The first time at Cure we took one look at the menu and knew some direction from our server would be needed and welcome due to the complexity of ingredients.  However our server was less than helpful, offering very little information beyond ""that's good"".  We ordered the Salumi which is a huge assortment of meats.  It was fun trying the different meats and we had little idea what we were eating.  The atmosphere was quite nice - cozy and quaint.  Overall we were disappointed on our first visit, but felt like we needed to take another shot at cure due to all the ""buzz"". 
Second visit - we were seated at the bar which was a little cramped but fine.  Our bartender was also our server and took quite a while to attend to us even though we were seated directly in front of him.  Our drinks were very small and very expensive for the size, but pretty (if that's what you want in a cocktail).  We went with wine for our next round of drinks.  Our meal was OK - we just weren't getting that jazzed about Cure overall.  We had the smoked trout and the gnocchi.  We also got an order of beef tartare which was excellent - best part of the meal.  For dessert we had frozen creme brulee which in our opinion didn't really ""work"".  We like creme brulee to be ""cremey"" not hard.  Finally we had some coffee with hazelnut liqueur that was just bad.  
So, overall we just aren't understanding all the hype and buzz surrounding this restaurant."
Negative	I knew this would be a basic room however I requested an upgraded room which cost $30. What a waste of money. The tub was rusty and old it looked very dirty however I think it was just worn and gross. Beds were fine but I am not sure what was actually upgraded as everything looked old and very used. To top it off I was also over charged which has not been resolved yet.
Negative	"I was a long client when it came to Italian food a few bad experiences and we stop coming. Recently we decided to try again. Unfortunately it was not to our liking. The Tuscan Chicken was burnt, lobster ravioli sauce was water and not ""creamy"" we did have excellent service and everyone was very kind. I don't recommend coming here."
Negative	This is the worst gas station in LV. Had a horrible experience with a faulty gas pump. Sprays gas all over you! The owner nor his management care. Tried to discuss with him only to learn he is a miserable human being. Arco should be ashamed to associate with him. This place is unsafe! People left laying in a puddle of gas and no offers to help or warn other patrons not to walk in it. One match and the entire place would blow up. I only hit 1 star because I had to in order to post this. Yelp should offer negative stars. ARCO, do something about this place! You are now on notice.
Negative	I really love watching the show and after I decided to visit Toronto I decided to make my way to Wahlburgers. First of all there is no public parking in the area. I had to pay $20 just to park to car to have a burger. Went inside and decided to do self service because the other side was full. There were an abundance of flies hovering over the food which is disgusting. Food isnt as good as they hyped it up to be. I can get better burgers elsewhere and definitely not worth going out of my way for.
Negative	"TLDR: Two stars for the excellent service provided by our server and food. Lower overall rating due to the way my restaurant reservation was mishandled and due to the unsatisfactory response from the restaurant Management when I brought it to their attention.

We made a reservation for 07:00pm and requested a booth for a party of 4. The reason for requesting a booth was, we have a child in our party and our child is still jet-lagged as we have travelled from East coast and tends to lie down at this hour (10:00pm EST). We showed up on time, and when I said we have a reservation for 07:00pm, the hostess stand looked surprised. They said, let me show you a table and let us know if you like it. They showed us a 16 capacity (8 on each side) tall stool-top seating area which was not acceptable to us. Reading other reviews I have now learnt that they offer this seating to those *without* reservation. They then asked us to wait until they could get us a booth. They said wait for 10 minutes at the other end of the restaurant. At 07:15pm, they didn't have a booth and they showed us seating with 4 chairs which we couldn't take for the reason mentioned above. While standing near the 4 chair area, I noticed an empty half booth half chair seating right across and asked to be seated there instead. The hostess said it was reserved for a 09:00pm reservation. At this point I said to her, we also have a reservation and we are here, why can't you give it to us? And why isn't anything reserved for us in a similar fashion.

I spoke to the manager and she was unapologetic. She essentially said the reservations are just ""luck of draw"". She said, restaurant honored our reservation by offering us the tall stool-tops. She even said ""some kids do like to seat on the stool tops!"". I asked her why can't they give us that half chair - half booth. Manager said they will need those beginning at 09:00pm. I asked why at 09:00pm and she relayed the same information that there was a reservation for it. And I said to her - ""exactly my point"". We also have a reservation. For us it was the ""luck of draw"" and for the 09:00pm party you are holding the seats since 07:00pm.

We got seated at 07:30pm at a different half chair half booth combination. The food and the service offered by the servers was excellent. Manager on the other had no sympathy and admitted no fault."
Negative	"Cozy lil bar further down Fremont street. My first time and I don't know what was going on there but their was a lot of interesting people. I think an event was in place because everyone was on bicycles in EDC attire. 

Anyways, let's talk drinks, food and service. 

Drinks:
good selection of beers from tap to bottles and they had description which I found helpful. 
Cocktails were too sweet or sour and I'm not a big fan of. 

Food:
the bar itself doesn't serve food but they teamed up with ""King sausage"". Different kinds of sausages, pretzels and even perogis(did I spell it right?). 
another food truck came when we were leaving and also a Elotés vendor. 

Service:
I believe they have 3 bartender wells but only 2 were open, with 3 bartenders working. They look discombobulated and panicked. The end of the bar was totally neglected. Unfortunately, this is where my group was. it was poor service...no excuses. 

Overall, I want to check it out on a slower evening but for now I give it 2 stars-"
Negative	"I really do love Gallagher's Steakhouse but one of my favorite things was to stop in for lunch and grab a drink and eat some calamari. But recently they've definitely downgraded their calamari and it's the biggest disappointment. The calamari is way too thin and it almost tastes chemically. 
I've only eaten at this place for dinner once a year ago and it was phenomenal. I'm hoping that they haven't started to cheap out on the rest of their menu."
Negative	This is a nasty excuse for a restaurant. Last night, I got food poisoining and was dumping and vomiting at the same time. It was the chicken philly - how do I know - because I threw the whole damn sandwich up in the shower. Hell will be raised and unless you want to suffer the same fate, stay away from this lowlife part of town and disgusting excuse for a restaurant.
Negative	At what point did dinning become bring your damn pets inside?? Why am I eating at a table while a dog is in the booth behind me SITTING IN THE SEAT. so great, now the next person will come and sit where the dog was sitting. How disgusting.
Negative	So far, not a fan...  In their defense, I tried them not long after they opened.  Maybe they were still working out the kinks.  I had heard from friends that the food was great, so we wanted to try them.  Tried to order online, but the newish store was not in the online ordering system yet.  So in I went...  Was unpleasantly surprised that I had to write my own order down.  Wouldn't normally be such a bad thing, but trying to wrangle a 1 year old and fill out order bags for 4 subs was NOT fun...  Then I stood and waited for a half hour (not exaggerating) while they made our subs and there were only 4 people ahead of me in line.  With at least 6 employees making subs, that seemed like a very long time.  Again, factor in the impatient 1 yr old...  They called one of my son's subs out, then three other people, which didn't make sense, since I watched them hang our entire order together.  When I finally had our order and got home, I discovered that there were 6 things incorrect on my sub (including my meat choice), which seems very odd considering that the ingredients are written right on the bag that they are stuffing the sub into...  Bread was stale-ish.  the other ingredients, although not what I ordered, seemed to be good quality.
Negative	"I have shopped the store a few times.  They have a wide selection of shooting related items. Their prices are at or above MSRP, however.  I went there the other day to purchase a shotgun, which they had in stock.  The price was full MSRP list price.  But, it was not an expensive gun and it was convenient to get it from them and not travel even further to find it.  They do all their NICS checks on a computer.  Unfortunately, all three of them were not operating.  The clerk who was helping me disappeared into the back of the store to see what could be done.  He returned and said they were down and the computer guy was not going to deal with it any time relevant to me that day.  It sounded like he and the computer guy did not give a darn.  They have no back-up system, like using the government form.  He said he would put the gun aside and I could come back whenever they managed to get the computers fixed, which sounded to me like a long time.  My conclusion is that the store is okay to drop in if you are nearby, but it is not on my list of go-to places when I am seriously looking for something.  And retailers wonder why Internet shopping is rendering them obsolete.  They should at least pretend to care.  The attitude seemed to be ""We can't help you.  Too bad, so sad."""
Negative	"My work had a food truck day and Burgatory was one of the vendors. I was excited to try them as their menu looked great. After waiting about 15 mins my order was ready!!!....No so exciting.

The burger is small, just slightly bigger than a slider. The burger itself was burnt, not hockey puck burnt but still burnt enough. Most of the dish is just fries (not the greatest either). 
I was really disappointed but I will consider giving them a second change, maybe the restaurant will be better). 

Im on the fence only because my first experience was not great and the burgers are pricey so it didn't help that I felt ripped off. 

Till next time.

XOXO, Happy Eats!!!"
Negative	"I have an unauthorized transaction that took the entire balance on my bank, and the unauthorized charged came from ""Sports Chalet 2068 Las Vegas"".  Awful!!!!  Beware!!!! If you want to shop on this store, try to use cash."
Negative	Been meaning to try this place out for months. Service was great and the atmosphere was nice. However, the food was well below average. Had Sirloin Steak and Ribs with sweet potato. Steak was bad, ribs were too charred and the potato was soaked in butter with too much brown sugar. Not likely to go back.
Negative	They absolutely suck. Rude on the phone. Said they already closed the kitchen an hour early & I advised them to change the time on Yelp, but they say they are still open, but no kitchen. WTF? And they refused to answer if they used artificial flavours or if it was all natural. Never!
Negative	"We went there for a staycation.  I joined their club as well. They had a big group there so we didn't get the room upgrade. Had to change rooms because of bugs. The restaurant and bar were closed because of an event for the big group so we had to use the crowded lobby to use our drink coupons. The drink I ordered, one of their special drinks, was awful. They did replace it. You should know that parking is $18 per night. 
We had room service for breakfast and my husband's eggs were odd with a strange texture like they had been frozen or something. 
The hotel is very retro with mid-century modern decor. While it looks cool all of the chairs were very uncomfortable for sitting. Bathroom was kind of cool with a deep soaking tub, a separate shower and vessel sink. The bathroom is separated by a glass panel. When one person uses the bathroom during the night the whole room lights up. I tend to judge rooms by their linens. The towels were kind of harsh, not soft and fluffy. Like many higher end hotels, no fridge and never found a hair dryer. Overall this hotel was rather disappointing"
Negative	"You walk in and you pay more than they say. Than you wait to be seated.  Salads ok, no sizzle. 
Corn on the cob, has no taste. They left it in water too long.  And I won't talk about the chicken,"
Negative	Do you only reason I gave this review one stars because I had to. The worst shopping experience I ever had in my whole life. One checkout lane for the entire store with somebody at it. I had produce in things and I didn't want to do a self check. That's what I was told to do if I didn't like it. The manager there her name is Corina. She is a witch. With all the people working in that store I guess no one was capable of running a check out lane.
Negative	This used to be Fletchers and I really liked the family feel. Now they are Firestone and completely changed the vibe. It is very corporate feeling now and extremely over priced. I needed to get my air conditioning compressor replaced they quoted me more than double what I just paid to get it repaired.
Negative	This location of Starbucks has very upbeat baristas and employees. However the past four days I've been there I have tried to order the pink drink and they have been out of the ingredients everytime. I understand that this happens but for how many days are they not going to restock their supply needed? It's frustrating. So instead I got the blackberry drink that is similar to the pink drink- 0/10 would not recommend it at all.
Negative	This makes me so sad to have to leave such a low star review for this place. We try and come here a few times a month, the food has always been good and the portion size is large for the cost. This location has a great atmosphere as well! However this experience was so bad that we have to mention it in hopes that they can fix these issues. We came in on Tuesday night around 7:30 it wasn't to busy normally we always end up on a wait. Worth the wait usually. We asked if we could sit outside we were told we couldn't it was closed. Strange we have always been able to in the past and we had out of town visitors that wanted to take advantage of the warm night. So we were sat inside instead. Maybe they didn't want to have to walk outside to serve a table. Took forever for the waitress to even come to our table. Then another 6 min to bring us 4 waters. She never once checked back on us after the food was dropped off making it hard to order anything else throughout the meal or for her to do a quality check. The worst part was she brought the dessert out with our table full of plates, and pizza pan there was hardly even room to set it down. She managed to find room without even pre bussing. She knew we had dessert coming would have been nice if she cleared they table first. Horrible service. Good food. However service can def make or break the place. We raved to our guests about this place instead they had the same reaction we did horrible service.
Negative	Please stay away from this station there pump never get tested and they will rip you off, my friend as a metal container 20 litres and it toke 24 litres to fill up, we went to another station and it's 20 litres on the noose, so if you think that you save to buy cheaper gas here you are very wrong because they are ripping you off on 20 percent
Negative	"Walked in and hit by a cloud of smoke. I can deal with that, but it's not something I prefer. 
Once we came in and sat down the bartender looked and asked what we wanted, we didn't know yet so he walked away. 
Here is why this place has a one star review and will never have my service. 
A woman walked up to me and my boyfriend right when we got there and asked us how we were doing. We were weirded out by this random woman who had dead eyes and looked like she was strung out on heroin so we weren't very responsive and she walked away. Then a minute later came back to me and said ""so did you come with anyone?"" And I pointed to my boyfriend and said ""yes, him"". Then she goes ""I'm with these two guys and they're taken by you"" (insert old guy and creepy younger guy here) and I said ""Oh well no sorry"" and she said ""they're interested in doing a porno movie with you"" and my jaw literally dropped and I just said no. She goes ""maybe next time"" and gives a creepy smile and walks away. 
If these are the patrons that frequent this bar and make another guest feel incredibly uncomfortable I'm shocked they are still in service. We left immediately after this happening."
Negative	Never open. Times on the door doesn't reflect store hours. Last time I tried the food fish tasted frozen. The mixed veggies they also sell are frozen. Many items are labeled fresh on the menu but taste seems otherwise.
Negative	Had a water pipe leaking.  The sister company was great with the cabinets etc, but now 3 months later I still do not have my floors fixed and cannot get a reply from anyone at Patterson after leaving multiple messages and text messages. Initially I received replies reassuring me the floors were coming, then they were delayed, then they were delayed because of fires, then reassured again he would call every day until we were able to get the floors. I even have a text message on 11/14 saying the floors were being delivered to the office on 11/24.  I am assuming he has not been calling every day for the last month since I have been ghosted by this company.  He promised to contact me with an update after Christmas. You would think these floors are super special, but nope just your standard flooring. It is Jan 8th and still nothing. I have been completely patient with this company and just want my floors fixed.  They already have the insurance check otherwise I would have already asked a different company to complete this job.  I would never use this company again.
Negative	I can't even begin to describe how bad the staff at this establishment treats their patrons! It all starts with extremely rude bouncers and ends with bartenders and servers who treat their patrons with zero respect. This place needs a serious customer service reality check.
Negative	"I had an hour and 15 minutes for lunch today.  Jury Duty.  Walked a couple blocks north and east and came across this place.  Sign outside said something about now open for lunch.  I like pizza and the place wasn't crowded yet so in I went.  Maybe that should have been a warning though.  Two people in line in front of me.  2 and a half people working the kitchen and register.  Nearly 10 minutes to get ordered and rung up at the register.

Picked an open table, there were a lot of them, sat down with my number 8 and waited.  

Now I am not trying to be a snob, their claim is you can't rush good food.  And they have a mini conveyor oven. Double level though.  Like a mini Dominos.  Who does that today?  And the dough was initially shaped by a tool. Not the guy operating the press.  A dough press machine thing. Placed on a screen. Anyway it says 7 minute cook time.  So why was it more like 20?  Now I am stressing a little bit.  Haven't even received my pie yet and I'm thinking about how long it will take me to get back to the court house. 

Rating is dropping the longer I have to wait. I'm thinking maybe they just shouldn't try to open for lunch. 

Somehow I got my pie before the two guys in front of me.  And they ordered the same thing. 

It's burnt in one edge and somehow not cooked all the way elsewhere. Can't really hold up a slice, it just, well collapses on itself.  I scarf down two slices because I am hungry. I need to get going though.  I need to find a homeless person on the way back to give this to.  And hope they don't chase me down trying to give it back!"
Negative	Well, stopping in for dinner turned into stopping in for a drink as the menu was scarce for veggie friendly options.  Scarce=non existent.  So, we took a chilis detour! Thank goodness for connected shoppin centers.  However, for those interested, the place has got the game on with lots of tvs available and it definitely has a great venue for chilling out with folks, having some dranks, and watching some sports.  The menu is bar foods, like wings and such!  So enjoy!
Negative	Well the food was not bad. The food was cold. The service was rotten. When we complained about the temperature of the food, we were told they made the pakoras an hour ago so that's why they are cold and the rest of the food needs to be stirred to get the good hot. We had both stirred the food already before taking it. It was luke-warm at best. The only thing worse than cold buffet, is them not offering to warm your food or fix it any way. We will not return.
Negative	"If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page! 
Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner.
We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said ""Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it."" Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle. 
Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was ""Well this is Vegas!"" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills).
Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement. 
The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested. 
STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression."
Negative	Went here for the first time thinking I'd give them a try with my shop being nearby. No hello, no I'll be right with you. Couldn't tell who were customers and who were employees. Whoever just let me stand by the front desk, without any courtesy whatsoever. Eventually just walked out. If you need to go to a speed shop in Vegas, hit SoCal Speed Shop. They treat you good.
Negative	"I guess if you are looking for an all you can eat buffet that won't cost an arm and a leg, you MAY like this place. 

I did not. 

Most of the food is either fried and/or is covered in one gelatinous ""sauce"" or another. I came away feeling crummy. 

The staff is borderline hostile. While you're pulling your chair out to sit down, they run over and ask what you want to drink. No menus, they don't tell you what they have to drink - you're just supposed to know. 

Ok. Beer? No beer. Coke Zero? She looked at me like I asked for horse piss. She wrinkled her nose and repeated back to me, ""Coke zero?!?!"" I said, ""Diet Coke?"" She said, ""Diet Pepsi"". Whatever. 

Off she went. I wondered if they had the deal where you pick your meats and noodles and whatnot and they cook them for you. I approached the hostess/manager and said, ""I've never been here before. Can you tell me how it works?"" She said, ""All food."" and walked away. I saw some people later with it so apparently they do offer it but when I walked over to what I thought was that section, there was nobody there to help me.

It was very loud in there and they played the music very loud also, making it impossible to have a conversation.

As you probably gather, I will not be back."
Negative	Stayed in westlake for a wedding and needed a ride 1.7 miles to the reception from the hotel.  They said it would only be a few minutes, took over an hour to get there. Made me late and I walked in after the intro's and in the middle of the first dances.  Called them to pick me up after, an hour and fifteen minutes later I called them back and they still didn't even have anybody on the way.  Had to walk to a bar across the street because the hall was closing, finally I ended up just catching a ride with somebody else from the wedding after about an hour and forty five minutes.  Terrible Service.
Negative	Well I must be missing something guys. From start to finish it was just ok. Chicken and waffles were average, the waffles tasted a bit doughy but the chicken breast( chicken fingers) were seasoned well.  I specifically asked if they were chicken fingers and was told no it was chicken breast. I asked for a side of jalapeño bacon however I couldn't get it because it only goes with the shrimp and grits. They did send out a side of the regular slab bacon complimentary(?) while I appreciate the gesture I would have gladly paid for the jalapeño bacon.  The jazz music was great, the chef came out and talk to every table......except ours  I'm a foodie and would have loved to chat ( the restaurant was not busy).  We travel  a lot and for me when I go to an independent restaurant the little things bring me back. This spot was just not for me.
Negative	Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes  before I had to go to the host and tell them we need a server.  Then I waited another 15 for a cappuccino  that was cold when ordered hot. Waitress disappears again and does not check on us. Another 20 minutes go by and best believe I have talked to the manager and leaving because of their horrible service. Not to mention that is not even busy! I had to choose 1 star otherwise , I couldn't post this review! This location deserves zero stars!
Negative	"Won't be using this service again. Party bus with drinks was cool, but our ""host"" Vicki was rude and unprofessional. My partner and I tried to be kind with her and strike conversation. I texted her during one of the club visits to confirm pick up time and location. She rudely replied to confirm the pickup by stating she had just said that to us. ""Yeah. Smh."" Even other people in our group thought that was a rude way to respond to a customer, WHO WERE TIPPING YOU FOR DRINKS AND YOUR SERVICE. Really is a bummer, quite the potential for an amazing experience. Maybe more kind, courteous and professional hosts should be hired."
Negative	"I went here last night with my sister (I've been a few other times prior to this) and we were looking for Christmas-y stuff to put up around our house. Our mom decided she's spending Christmas with us as its our first one away from ""home."" Anyways, the store was typical of a 99 Cents Only Store; not very clean, not a total Purell-Your-Hands-After-Everything-You-Touch place. In fact, we really didn't have any problems until checking out. 

There were two cashiers and about 15 people waiting in the two lines, even with it moving. When I got up there, I had glass objects and glass photo frames. The little wench ringing it up was throwing my stuff, I kid you not. She kept rolling her eyes and looking over to someone else in the store who worked there. She'd yell over at them in Spanish and while yes, I speak Spanish, I was more interested in making sure my items weren't damanged or completely hopeless as she was totally careless. Since, I find these stores to be really sketchy, I ran my debit card as ""credit,"" and had to sign something. She flung a pen at me and shoved the receipt over. 

Total bitch. Probably underpaid, but she should be thanking her lucky stars I didn't find the manager (I would if there weren't several people behind me growing impatient with her as well). It was an okay place to go to in a pinch (we're sort of on a budget and just wanted a couple of things to hang up or place throughout the house), but I wouldn't come here often. 

Also, there was a weird smell coming from the frozen food section. It smelled like rotting vegetables, and probably was since they had ""fresh"" (HAAA!!!) vegetables in a display case across from it."
Negative	"Worst online/store shopping experience ever.

Inventory counts were wrong, Nichole at the Hayden Scottsdale AZ store was condescending and dismissive when I asked about the incomplete order but full price receipt. Took 2 more trips to 2 more stores and a manager 15 minutes to get it straightened out. 

Won't do that again."
Negative	"I am a huge Cirque du Soleil fan. I have seen O twice, Ovo, Mystere, Quidam, Zarkana and Dralion. The concept of Zumanity intrigued me because going to Vegas for the first time since turning 21, the idea of ""the sensual side to Cirque"" was one I thought would encompass the adult theme of Vegas. Don't get me wrong, it did, but with a sacrifice. I did not think the stunts were as difficult as many of the other Cirque shows. Moreover, the dancing and soundtrack did not stand out as well. However, with that being said, if you're there for a fun time, the ""clown"" hosts of Zumanity will definitely make you laugh, especially with crowd interaction. The Zumanity experience is very different from that of other Cirque shows - it is a lot more intimate. For example, the theater was small and the performers of Cirque greet you when you head into the theater when doors open.

Front row seats are going to get you a good amount of interaction so keep that in mind when booking Zumanity!"
Negative	"I have been to the Valley Ho many times and confidently gave them a five star rating in the past. However, my last experience made me question whether I'll ever stay here again. I have waited some time to write this review because I don't want to write it out of resentment. So, here's to hoping I can be as objective as I can.

In past visits, I have witnessed many people having large paries here. Bachelor and bachelorette parties, birthday parties, weddings, and parties just for the fun of it. This hotel has a swanky, modern party flair. So when my husband's 30th birthday came up in February, I thought the Valley Ho would be a perfect place to host it. I called them about a month in advance and let them know that we were going to have his birthday party here and I rented out the most expensive room at the time (Tower Loft Suite, almost $600 with taxes). The person on the other line did not in any way tell me this isn't allowed. During the month leading up to the party, I made invitations, decorations, and spent hundreds of dollars between food and alcohol/mixers for classy drinks. We rented out the largest room to ensure that it would hold our guests (about 20 people) and I was very clear of our intentions when reserving the room. Fast forward to the day of the party. I was so excited because I had put more effort and time into this party than any I've ever hosted. The valets and bellhops were super nice and helpful. If I could still give them 5 stars, I would. However, when we approached the front desk, I was forced to sign a ""no party"" waiver. What. My heart dropped into my stomach and I went into panic mode. Since it was the day of, I was unable to get a refund. So there I was with a $600 room, car full of decorations and food, and according to this waiver, not allowed to have more than 4 people in this huge room at once. The group of friends that we invited are very tame, very respectful people. This wasn't going to be a party where people got trashed and created havoc, so I figured we would be quiet enough that we wouldn't bother our neighbors. You have to understand, I had no other choice here. I couldn't call off the party just hours before it started.

So fast forward to 10PM. Nobody is drunk, nobody is being obnoxious, the music is so quiet we could barely hear it, and everybody is behaving themselves like adults. Literally just mingling and talking with each other while a couple of the guys hung out on the balcony. There were maybe 13 people left at this point (I'm telling you, we're not party animals). Then there is a knock on the door and a man and woman in official uniform tell me I need to kick everyone out but 3 other people. Tears started welling up in my eyes and again, I began to panic. It was 10 PM. In downtown Scottsdale. At a supposed swanky party hotel. I was at a loss for words and was forced to sign another paper that said they'd kick us out if we didn't kick our guests out. They weren't friendly, helpful, or apologetic in any way. They shrugged me off when I asked about the other parties going on throughout the hotel. And then they left. When I went back in the room, I had to deliver the bad news to grown adults (some of which had traveled from over an hour away) that we had to move the party from the room to the bar downstairs (my idea to save face). It was humiliating, although our guests did sympathize with me after explaining the situation. We didn't order much at the bar, as we had unlimited drinks and food in the room and we were all pretty disappointed. The party died out pretty quick after that. Let the record show that not one of our guests went home drunk, and I am confident the outcome would have been the same had we stayed in the room.

It frustrates me because I was not warned that parties weren't allowed when I scheduled the reservation, especially since I told him we were going to have a party. However, I had seen several parties going on on the balconies the night of ours. And parties every other time I have ever stayed here. People were yelling and partying at 3 AM that night next door to us. I felt like the staff treated us like we were having a frat party, when in reality, we were very respectful and chose this particular hotel so we could have an upscale, classy party. That $600 could have easily gone toward a different venue that would have happily allowed us to have a classy party. 

I felt like this experience was so unfair, both to me who had put so much time, thought, effort, and money into it, and for my husband, who only turns 30 once. We were regulars here, but I don't think I'll ever come back after how we were treated."
Negative	"My ex girlfriend used to love going shopping at Target in the US because they had so many cute little things and I have to confess, there was some neat stuff there.  

The Target at Square One? There was a huge buzz about it coming to Canada but it's been a bit of a letdown. I actually have a feeling Target will be out of Canada in the next 5-6 years if they don't improve their marketing, pricing and variety.  Their clothes look okay, but they have limited groceries and everything else is the same price as Walmart.  

The problem with the Canadian Target is that their prices are higher than US prices, have less variety and are trying to force their US retail strategy onto Canadian without any modifications to their business model and that usually doesn't work in Canada (e.g. Krispy Kreme, note: Walmart adjusted their strategy by catering to culturally specific holidays and noting that Canadians respect multiculturalism).  

I still go to Target, and the only reason is because lines are too long at Wal-mart."
Negative	I didn't particularly find the staff all that friendly. There was a big line and only one person manning the register while three other employees where talking in the background not helping.  Also like all other Starbucks they wouldn't do a 50 Cent refill on their coffee like all the other Starbucks. I skip this one but more than likely if you're staying at the Venetian you'll go there anyways.
Negative	"I was disappointed with the service and the food.  Heard so many good things, but I  was dissatisfied.  Will not be going back here again on my next trip to Scottsdale.  

Waited a long time for the hostess to greet us.

My husband ordered the hamburger and said it was fine.  I had the hummus and pita triangles. Really nothing special."
Negative	Attempted to call and resolve previous issue from my previous experience at Snazzy Dogz. Have called and spoken to JB four times asking for Kellie. It would appear that this is not as high of a priority as was suggested in Kellie's review.
Negative	Such a shame, could be outstanding but ends up flat. A great location cool old building with great bones. That's where it ends the music was extremely loud for a dinner time setting. The service was terrible we ordered cocktails 5 min before our dinner was ordered and our entrees came out before the drinks did. The Manhattan was average (coming from a former bartender that's being generous). As for the meal, my wife ordered the quesadilla and it was above average. I ordered the London broil which is one of my favorite dishes and was disappointed, the marinade was bland the meat was undercooked and cut incorrectly.   Overall we would not return which is a shame because we are in this area often for shows at the music factory.
Negative	"We love thai food and have it twice a week.
To top up with a bad attitude  was a sluggish service and low quality watery curries.
Waste of money, would never visit or recommend"
Negative	I used them in the past and the service and results were fine. Not outstanding, but fine.  I took some shoes in a few months ago, again. I wanted them to put a thin rubber sole on the bottom of several pairs of my dressy heels because I found them slippery , and to also repair the leather on the stiletto heal of my FAVOURITE red patent leather sandals. Not only did they not repair the heal, but they RUINED my favourite red shoes. For some reason, unknown to me, they cut off the original sole of the shoes, and then glued the rubber sole to the underside of the lining of the sandals!  I expected them to just glue the rubber sole to the existing sole, and if they were going to cut the original off, they should've have warned me and asked my permission. I didn't know this for a couple months. As I didn't have reason to wear those sandals, and truth be told, I didn't inspect them when I picked them up as I was in a hurry.  They were in a cloth bag. A couple of weekends ago, I pulled them out to wear them. To my horror, I realized what they had done to the sole. It is a black sole on a red patent leather shoe. Which is fine, except that they got black smudge marks all over the sides of the red straps. And they must've tried to clean it up, because they managed also to take the shine off the patent leather on the sides.  BTW, that black rubber sole has come unglued from the shoes and I never even took them out of that cloth bag until the discovery day!!!! I payed almost $200 for these sandals. And they're destroyed. They were almost new when I took them in. Now I have to throw them out! And since its been a few months, and I don't have a receipt that itemizes a description of the shoes they repaired, I doubt I have any recourse. I've been stewing about it since I discovered it. I've never written a review about any business before. But this really upset me. They did the same thing to the other shoes I left at the same time, but I didn't love those shoes, so I'm less upset. If I could, I'd give them negative stars. They're suppose to be a shoe repair place not a shoe destroy place. Soooo disappointed I cried.
Negative	"I hate to have to give this location a bad review because I come here so often and have always had a really great experience. I have been coming here almost weekly (sometimes more than once a week) for the past year during lunch time. Every time our bill is usually $70 or more, mainly due to our drinks! 

However, the past few times we have gone here, have been really bad. We walk in, sit at the bar area where we normally sit, and then we wait....and wait..and wait. One time we waited 15 mins before the bartender even appeared. I would have walked out and gone else where if I wasn't such a fan of this location. 

Just last week our bartender (she had Blonde hair) was probably the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered a Coconut Sakerita and it didn't taste like coconut at all! It tasted like the lime sour mix they put in it. I have had this drink before an know what its suppose to taste like..and it is not suppose to taste like that. The worst part about it is that it didn't even tasted like coconut one bit. Then she disappeared again for 20 mins. Thank goodness for this other waitress that walked by who seen how annoyed I looked. She came over and offered her assistance with getting us another drink, in which she had no problem making the coconut drink correctly. Our group ended up being over 30 mins late back to work because of how slow our bartender was and her annoyingly long disappearances. 

Most recently, yesterday, we came here again for lunch. We sat down and waited about 5 mins before we seen the bartender. Again the Coconut drink was made wrong. Our food was extremely slow to come out and there was hardly anyone there. 

I have always loved this location. Their food is usually always really good, never really had an issue with it, Aside from the garlic edamame (I believe they changed their recipe casing them to be more greasy than before...which isn't a good thing). The staff has always been really nice, fast, and attentive. However, these past few weeks have really gone down hill. The staff really needs to be trained better on service and how to make their drinks. And there should never be a time where a customer is waiting wondering where the heck the bartender is. As stated before, I have been a very loyal customer to this specific location, always giving great reviews to my peers, however, I cannot say I can continue to unless something drastically changes."
Negative	"Husband & I decided to try this out after going to the ""Flavors of the West"" Goodyear event. The seafood gumbo was watery but the flavor was okay, the jambalaya was a sticky dry mess on your plate and it came with a side salad that you can tell it was a grocery store bagged salad not fresh at all! At the end we were hoping for at least something to take the bad taste in your mouth and we ordered dessert, big mistake! The ""Banana pudding"" was boxed pudding.... the beignets were dense and had more powder sugar on them that if you exhaled while you took a bite it would go flying everywhere. I wouldn't recommend this food and you really don't even want to get me started on the ambiance... Seriously! Try it at your own risk!!!!"
Negative	Bad service, pretty good food, too pricey for what it is. A calzone and a sandwich was over $24. That's ridiculous. You are paying for the 'Disneyworld of Hemp' decor. Won't go back, but the food was decent.
Negative	Worst customer service. The employees there are very rude. Especially the people who take you in the range, wish they know how to talk! Customers pay a hefty amount for the shooting. I opted for the Black op with 4 gun options which is $180 not for someone to talk rudely with you! One guy by the name Mike was ridiculously rude !
Negative	I've been here four times, twice to get coffee and twice to get a drink. I haven't eaten any of the food so I can't speak to that. It's not a bad spot to get a coffee especially if you can enjoy the patio without too many smokers ruining the experience. But if you're coming for a drink (to get anything other than a beer because they can't mess that up too much), go anywhere other than here. I was craving a White Russian and was foolish enough to order one here. You might as well skip the booze and drink a glass of half and half on the rocks, because that's all they'll serve you. On the other occasion, I ordered a vodka soda which was (you guessed it) just soda. A waste of money. I will never come back here.
Negative	we started at Gallo Blanco but the place was packed so my friends suggested Otto as they are affiliated. I was not impressed! I keep a list of restaurants to try and based on Otro, Gallo Blanco is still on it but has slipped in the ratings for sure! I don't like when everything is a la carte I figure the chefs knows the menu and should pair things it also greatly increases the cost. I think it's decent but I think they think they're better than I do for sure
Negative	"So disappointed. We opted for a security door with ""hinged glass."" We were told that First Impressions was the only company who offers this feature. Well, there's a reason for that - it DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. When the hinged glass is open and you open the security door, the hinged glass follows and hits you in the back. When you close the security door, the hinged glass bangs against your inside wood doors, gouging the wood and marring the finish. I asked someone to come out and fix it, thinking maybe there was an adjustment that could be made, but the repair person said there wasn't, agreed with me that it was a design flaw, and expressed surprise that no one had complained about it. But he couldn't fix it - said he would report it to their engineers and someone would be in touch. That was several weeks ago - I'm not holding my breath. In addition, the lock sticks, despite having been ""fixed."" The installation didn't go smoothly either - some parts were missing ??? and had to be installed at a later date. It took several phone calls to schedule installation of the missing parts and to have the hinged glass looked at. We paid $4200 for a door with design flaws and got very poor customer service. Do NOT buy this door."
Negative	"I am not thrilled about Intrigue. I was excited that a new club was opening but was let down since I didn't see much change at all. I went on a Thursday night with my fun girlfriend. We didn't have a table or reservation so we waited about 15 minutes before we got in. That's with a line, just waiting for the bouncer to decide when to let us through. Local females don't need to pay admission which was nice and there's a time period where the ladies drink well drinks for free. I on the other hand was drinking wine on this particular evening and didn't want to mix alcohol. I got my first glass inside where the lovely bartenders were helpful and the 2nd at the outside bar.

There was a bartender named Kelly at the bar outside that lacked in the customer service department and decided to try to serve an attractive male customer that had arrived after me, luckily he was nice enough to ask her to serve me first since I was there before he was. She then poured a different wine into my glass which was shocking to say the least. I cocktailed and bartended for years and I have never seen such a rookie mistake. 

The music was a mixture of old school hiphop and more recent trap music which could be a good change for certain people. But since this is neither a huge club that we don't lack in this city and it's not a lounge either I wouldn't know how to classify this club other than a basic club you would find a smaller city."
Negative	"I've had better.

Hubby and I ate here...we loved it...at first.  

We started out with Lettuce Wraps and it was great seemed a little salty but seemed great. I tried just a few bites.
Jasmine hot tea was great.
Hubby tried orange chicken and it had real orange and orange peel zest was present.
I got a veggie lo-mein add garlic. Both seemed like great dishes.

Here is why I only give this place two stars.
1.THEY USE MSG. I'm 2000% sure. Why am I so sure? Because I'm VERY allergic. Had a migraine right after. Was very sick. I don't know if they state if they do/or do not and it's my fault for not asking. 

2.Hubby got food poisoning. How do I know? We went for lunch. Was the only thing he ate that day. :( He was sick all night.

Two stars was a stretch...but they were nice and the place seemed organized. Can not and will not go back."
Negative	This business has no heart,they seem to be all about the almighty dollar.  I brought my dog in and it's $150.00 just to see the vet. Than they want to do an ultra sound without even barely talking to me at another  $500.00.This test will lead to others and lots more dollars. They play on people's ties to their animals.  It's a shame that the money comes first not the animal.  I know that vet's are expensive but this place is a rip off
Negative	"Let me first clear that the food here is great. There was not a single complaint from the large group of 15 coworkers I was with. A little on the spicy side for some, but certainly authentic Malaysian. 

What irked me about this experience though was the incredibly long wait to have our orders taken (30 minutes), and then the even longer wait for our food to arrive (~ 50 mins). And this is with reservations made 2 days in advance.

While our waiter was apologetic throughout the lunch, and assured us on several occasions that our orders were on their way, they simply took their sweet time to arrive. One of my coworkers even left before the food arrived to catch a meeting! Having learned this, the waiter didn't even offer her meal for free. Not cool.

Admittedly, this place gets incredibly busy during lunch, almost on a daily basis. Considering this, I would think that the owners of this establishment would either 1) hire more staff in the kitchen, or 2) not accept reservations from large parties. 

After this lunch, I learned from others that they had similar experiences of insanely long waits. Clearly, the owners of this establishment have no intention of  1) hiring more staff in the kitchen, and 2) not accepting reservations from large parties."
Negative	"I came here a couple years ago and it was phenomenal. I was so pleased with everything I ate and the selection was amazing.

I recently came back during a trip for business and was looking forward to returning. Boy was I disappointed.

Either my tastes changed or the buffet changed. I was not happy with anything they offered. Eggs were soggy. Bacon was pure fat. Sausages were dripping with oil and flavourless. Other items of beef and chicken and whatnot were entirely unpleasant and I couldn't believe that this was the same buffet that I enjoyed years ago.

I sat and sipped my coffee since the juice they served were either too sweet or just plain gross and at room temperature. Lunch rotation came and I stuck around.

The desserts were fun. I'm glad they came out. Those sort of helped to ease my disappointment. The food however wasn't much better. Sure a few items that came out were tasty as compared to breakfast, but still not worth the stomach ache.

I'm sorry, Le Village, but I will not be returning to your lovely buffet again. Your presentation is wonderful, but the price is not worth the coffee and dessert alone.

Adieu."
Negative	4 of us ate here and our bill was $120 (plus tip). We each had a burger and 3 beers were ordered...since when does a burger cost $20 bucks? WAY OVER PRICED!!! Service was very slow, not returning. There are plenty of other places much tastier and less expensive in the area.
Negative	"I have been here for several years. During this time have seen this property managed by several companies. Conam just took over the last year. My family moved into this complex for the security they provided, the diligence in screening prospect tenants and the amenities being offered. Further, we rarely saw neighbors move and had steady neighbors.  In the last year, this property feels like to has become more transient in nature. Just in the last two weeks, I have seen three neighbors moved out in the middle night. Our car was broken into a few months ago (along with a number of our neighbor's vehicles). The gates are not always working and this is a safety issue.

 Recently, they added reserved parking spots (not handicap parking) without notifying the tenants by email, flyer, or posting. As I work from home my vehicle tends to sit for a few weeks in the same spot. So on Saturday, I come out after my neighbor told me that my vehicle was tagged for towing. So it turns out they installed the sign in front of the spot I was parked in. After the sign was installed they placed a violation that my vehicle would be towed all within the same day!! How do you install a sign and the proceed to say you are towing my vehicle. I am sure this would be considered an unlawful tow in Nevada. I went to the office to complain and was greeted by a rude agent. I asked why there weren't notices placed on our door or on in the mailbox area and she had no response.  She proceeded to tell me my notice was the sign and the violation placed on my vehicle. I was astounded and amazed. I live here...I pay rent and I cant get common courtesy or reassurance that I can park in a spot without a reserved sign and know that one won't is placed when I'm on vacation and my car towed.

As parking, in general, is not reserved and hard to come by, my wife often has to park far away when she comes home from work at night and we often have to carry groceries the length of a football field to the apartment.

The windows are very drafty, so you will get cold sitting on your couch. That makes our NV Energy bill very high. We have had maintenance in our apartment regarding the windows and were told that there is nothing that they can do as one staff member told us that the building was built cheaply and proceeded to tell us to put ""towels in our windows"". Yes, not exactly ""luxury living"". 

Our tile was also replaced and the company that they hired did not grout the tile and placed the appliances back on top of it immediately after laying it. It is now cracked in NUMEROUS places. 
 The only improvement I have seen is with the maintenance staff. Ryan has been very good and attentive. There is no incentive to keep long term tenants from leaving. We have asked and were flat out told that there is nothing they can do for us."
Negative	"Don't bother with their ""overnight shipping"" and ""guarantee by 3pm the next day"" -- it's a waste of time and money. Our package was in the store by 10am, did not leave LV until 7pm, and wasn't delivered (still isn't) on time the next day. They charge an excessive amount for this ""guaranteed"" service only to fail. If we were told beforehand it wasn't going to make it onto the morning truck then why bother paying for that service? What a joke! The customer service is awful. We should have been refunded the difference in the amount to make it 2-3 day delivery since that is the service that's being done. We were met with nothing but excuses and it's still not delivered. Our business uses UPS quite a bit but we won't be returning to this store."
Negative	"it took 10-15 minutes to get drinks. By drinks, I mean water. At about 30 minutes in, we got one of our appetizers. My daughter had to go to the bar to ask for the other one. It took an hour to get our food and it was served one person at a time. Spaced so far apart that it became awkward. Our server had to be asked 3 times before we got a refill on water.  My daughter had to walk up to the bar for lemon. Again, after the third request. When we finally had all of or meals, it was disappointing to say the very least. From the presentation, I'm guessing someone just finished attending culinary school. Unfortunately, the preparation wasn't given as much attention as the presentation. The chicken was borderline undercooked. At that point, we weren't going to send it back and wait another hour so we shared food. Considering the time quantity and service, the food was highly overpriced. After the last meal was brought to the table, we were basically forgotten. The next time out server came out, it was to offer boxes for uneaten portions. We were never offered beverage refills or dessert. We were presented with our ticket only to find charges for items we did not order or receive. At that point I had had enough. When I complained, a man who I am assuming is the manager proceeded to tell me that if I didn't like it, leave a review. Good or bad. He didn't care. Then he basically threw us out stating, ""The door, it is very big. "" Needless to say, no tip was left and we wouldn't recommend this place to our worst enemy. And the door is just an average sized door."
Negative	"We had been craving Teppanyaki and wanted to check this place out so we went for their power hour. They have two griddles in the center of the restaurant when you first walk in, but they were only going to be having one 'show' that night. They decided they could squeeze us in and sat us in front of the griddle that was not going to be used. ) The whole table had 22 seats, and all but 5 were occupied so it was disappointing that they didn't have both griddles going. It also made the dinner service extra slow since one guy was cooking so much. 
I am allergic to shrimp, and usually the places we go to are willing to do the shrimp last or at least off to the side. ( I only ever get the veggies and tofu and its usually done well before anything else.) This place was not accommodating though-- which is fine since they were so busy-- so I just popped some benadryl and assumed that they would at least keep the stuff separate. The chef happened to put the shrimp directly touching the tofu I had ordered, which was a little annoying, there wasn't a shortage of space on the griddle at all as he hadn't started any of the other meats until after dishing out the veggies. Luckily the tofu was the worst tofu I have ever tried so i didn't even want to eat it.  It was extremely soggy and very very sugary.  My boyfriend spit out the bite that he tried as well. He had ordered the chicken and Filet for his entree, the chicken was doused in the same nasty sugar sauce that was on the tofu. The filet was very tender  though and between the two of us we did eat the whole portion of that. 
The fried rice was also good, but didn't taste anything like normal fried rice, we couldn't figure out what the taste was. 
The mushroom soup was okay, each bowl only had 2 impressively thin slices of mushroom in them. 
The prices were fair with it being their power hour ( meaning half off all teppanyaki entrees) So is wasn't such a big deal that the food wasn't good and the portions were so small.
Also, they do not have a sign saying 'rock lobster' from the street. We drove by the place twice before just driving into the complex to see if we could find it. They do have a sign, it is just facing the parking area and a dirt lot. 
We will not be returning."
Negative	"Mediocre food+Sexist service? Methinks not.

I came here to chill on a Sunday night by myself and got seated at the inner bar. I asked about the menu on the chalk board because it's written in greek. The server didn't offer me the Daily Fish (Seabass) special. He claimed that he never offered it to anybody because of its $38 price. But he offered it to a single middle age man right beside me? Sexist much? I guess since I'm woman, I will never have enough money to buy a $38 fish. He also didn't offer me dessert. I guess since I'm a woman, I will never eat any sugary treats either (I found out that this place serves dessert later on when a friend pointed it out)

The 'Tiganites Patates - Handcut Potatoes+Kefalotyri+Garlic Sauce' is a $8 fries(good fries, but definitely not worth the price), not those Lemon Greek Potatoes that people has in mind. The menu is tricky. Make sure you have your 'Man' to ask the server if you're not sure. I inquire the server about this, but he just said, ""Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about. Nah, it's just fries."" So, it seems that I'm not the first and only person who got ripped off by their tricky menu. I only ate 3 pieces of fries. There was no regret from the server even though I barely touched the plate. In other restaurants, when a server saw that the plate is barely touched, they would have taken it off the bill. But I guess, since I have no 'Man' with me, I don't deserve such treatment.

Just in case anyone is wondering. I ordered the $8Kopanisti, $16Goat Tartare, $16Halloumi, $15Roasted Cauliflower, $8Fries, $14Angostura Sour. With tips+tax, I ended up spending $100++ for this Sexist Service. This is my second time here, so hopefully this is just a one time thing. I will definitely bring a man next time though."
Negative	Came here twice and was forgotten in the waiting area, even when the restaurant was half empty. Never coming back again!!!! Food can't be that good to be disrespected like that.
Negative	"Considering I don't like Thai food,
I enjoyed my food (healthy cashew nut stir fry with beef). Others at my table did not enjoy there's as much. The wait was HORRIBLE. It took long just to get menus and dessert menus. The mango sticky rice wasn't good, but the mango cheesecake was. I wouldn't come back here though, the wait and heat was too much to bare."
Negative	Lynn basically said it all.  It took 3 months of calls and finally threatening legal action for them to get this rental to habitable standards after a door to the outside literally fell apart.  Now I am stuck with a door I cannot use to get to the patio, but according to them 'the issue has been resolved'.  I cannot stress enough how lousy and unprofessional these people are.  STAY AWAY!
Negative	"The double-decker pizza is a bomb. You just gotta try it. The large one can feed a lot of people as they cut it in 2"" squares and it's easier to hold and eat. Didn't get to try anything else but we'll definitely go back. Taste is good and they put a lot of cheese."
Negative	"In Vegas, the Superpawn shops are pretty clean and full of good stuff....so, I expected the same out of this Scottsdale location.  Boy, was I wrong!  This place was terrible!  They didn't have any quality items for sale.  All of their stuff was junk.

Besides the lack of product, the service here was terrible as well.  All of the employees were busy working the pawn windows, so I had to wait 20 minutes to have someone open up a jewelry case to look at some watches.  During that time, I felt rushed and the employee told me that if I was just going to browse she'd have to come back to me later because she was busy and would have to help the other customers who were waiting to pawn stuff.....seriously?!  How are they supposed to make money when you're not selling?!

This experience would never have happened at their Vegas stores.  They take care of their customers out there and have a balance between employees helping pawn customers and buying customers.

Return Factor - 1%"
Negative	Allen at People First Pest Control is a crook period! After our initial extermination,we scheduled a monthly spray of our house both inside and out. Allen came the first month and did the service but failed to show after that. We left phone and text messages that were never returned.  After spending over a $1000 we still have issues that Allen said would be taken care of. He's unreliable,  unprofessional  and a flake. Do not call him unless you want to be taken to the cleaners.
Negative	When did they START CHARGING FOR DAILY RESORT FEES FOR $35 a NIGHT I was by myself & my room was $100 plus a night, I stayed for 2 OK don't mind paying. I even paid in advance then when I check in $70 Dollars Please , I Said for WHAT???? Ok charge someone when they use the gym, get a news Paper, Print Airline Passed, Local Calls, Fax & copy... I NEVER USE ANY OF THAT STUFF ... anyway Loved Treasure Island, HATE the Resort Fees
Negative	Went in for a haircut. Nice place. Multiple barber chairs. 1 barber. He seemed irritate that I showed up at 2pm on a Monday. Told me I MUST have an appointment to be seen, which wouldn't be for several hours.  I won't be visiting that place again.
Negative	"Sooo disappointed.....we have tried this place in past and have loved it.... tried it again last night and was hugely disappointed....it reminded me of Coldstone Creamery or Marble Slab..... ice cream is bland but then you mix in all of this ""stuff""....ugh....I like REAL ice cream and I don't enjoy mixing junk into my ice cream.....so, it was a huge disappointment!   It was not like this the last time we went.....too bad they changed it."
Negative	Service was soooooo slow. Watching the staff was like watching the keystone cops.  I kept waiting for them to bump into each other and drop Pizza on the floor. Just because I didn't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen!
Negative	"I would give their Service Department 0 stars if I could. I normally avoid dealerships at all costs, but my regular mechanic could not figure out what was wrong with my vehicle. The Service Advisor at Airpark was condescending and very difficult to work with. Communication was nil. Long story short, after having my car in for service two times at Airpark Chrysler, my vehicle is still having the same issue. Thank goodness there are other Chrysler dealers in the area to choose from.

I will never return to Airpark Chrysler, and would highly recommend avoiding this place."
Negative	This place is absolutely terrible! It seems as if the Ac isn't working , there are no cups for water and no toilet seat covers. I'm appalled that this is a place for pregnant women. I get that it maybe low cost but what the fuck. Oh on top of that the appointment was for 12:00 and it's 1:17 and we are still sitting here
Negative	"I'm really not sure how this establishment has the rating that it does when on every occasion I've dined here the service has been absolute trash. On this last occasion, the hostess told my group that we had an hour and a half time limit on our table. I've never experienced that before but we had no intention of staying for that long anyway. However, the service was so slow I was actually concerned that we would exceed our ""limit."" I had to flag the server down multiple times. Never once did he ask if we had everything we needed or if we liked the drinks or the food. Nothing. Didn't care. Then he proceeded to charge my group a 20% autogratuity since we had a larger party (7 people... not that big). No wonder he gave trash service... He was going to autograt the check the whole time. None of us will be returning."
Negative	Our service was just not what I expected from a Las Vegas eatery. Even though it was New Year's Eve, the restaurant wasn't busy. There was no reason our apps should have outpaced our very simple drinks we ordered. There were at least two instances where someone took my drink order, and then I never saw he or she again -- and certainly didn't receive my drinks. The dishes were edible, far from memorable -- definitely not worth the price. I seriously doubt this place will be open in a year. Save your money and go elsewhere.
Negative	My family and I didn't like the food not even the pizza for my 5 year old! It's way too much money and for it not to even taste good! Go somewhere else! The desert wasn't all that good either!
Negative	Bonne nourriture mais très mauvais service! Cela fait deux fois que nous nous présentons en une semaine le restaurant était fermé. Les heures d'ouvertures n'ont aucun sens, il ne faut pas se fier aux heures écrit sur le net vous risquez de vous cogner le nez sur la porte!! Très désagréable
Negative	Got a massage today at their downtown location on Bloor. Bought a Groupon a few weeks ago, and finally had time to use it. First of all, the attendant charged me $6 for taxes when I arrived. I thought that it was all taken care of when I bought the Groupon. When I asked for a receipt, she gave me one with some misleading information that I tried to correct, but she freaked out and said to not change anything. Seemed shady to me, but as long as I got my full 1-hour massage, I decided to ignore it. The massage itself left me wondering if she had any kind of training in massage therapy at all. I've had worse massages, so that's why I'm giving them 2 stars. But would i recommend the place? No.
Negative	"I've been to many fast food places, but never one that just could never get an order right. Every time I go my order is always wrong. On top of that, the wait is very long. 
Don't waste your time coming here. This place is a joke."
Negative	Very uninviting with virtually no lights on. Walked in the bar one gentleman sitting at the bar. Smell of cigarette smoke and was just very dirty feeling. Bar tender was nice but was involved in the football. No drink menu available at all. Hard to see what they actually have to pour you. No beers on tap unless hidden behind the bar. Overall wouldn't recommend here and or stop in at all. I will go back.
Negative	Don't bother trying to do a mobile order here. Even though the app gives you a mobile order number, the store won't give you the orders unless the phone it was placed on is at the store. Why does the app give you an order number if the store cant do anything with it?
Negative	Employee was smoking weed with her boyfriend when I went to get a smoothie here. Did not like how it was made and requested to get a new one. She had an attitude and said she would rather give a refund. She was more concerned about getting back to her boyfriend and smoking on the job.
Negative	Make sure you see the actual apartment you are going to rent before signing or giving this place any of your money. Dealing with this complex has been a nightmare. If the people who lived in the apartment before you didn't clean it don't expect the complex to. The grounds in the front of the complex are kept clean & look nice, If you walk towards the back of the complex it is very different. The rent is affordable for being so close to downtown but I fully regret renting from this complex. The office ladies are so nice & very professional but the complex manager & maintenance employees are a joke. I had to contact the property owners because the apartment that was rented to me was so disgusting. They charge you a $200.00 cleaning deposit yet they sure don't make sure the apartment they are renting to you or the grounds around the apartment are kept clean. I greatly look forward to moving out. Like I said the rent is affordable for being so close to downtown but I wish I would have stayed at Residences at 4225 on 44th & McDowell. I'd rather have a clean apartment, a competent complex manager / maintenance people & pay a little more.
Negative	Super bad customer service. I have been a member of orange theory for years.   Unfortunately, I like the workouts but the new studio manager needs a lesson in customer service. I had to discontinue my membership a few months back due to an ankle fracture. I understand the policy of having to pay your last month and funds had already been taken out of my account a few days prior for the current month so I was left having to pay two months and not being able to use any class. One of the front desk girls told me that she would put five classes under my name for the future when I was able to come back to make up for the fact that I was not able to use any of the classes. I just stopped into the studio ready to work out and use one of my classes left in my account the studio manager would not let me use any of them unless I re signed up for a membership. He had the audacity to tell me that if he were to give me any more classes it would come out of his own paycheck. Little does he know I referred at least 10 people to the studio and I'm sure they were all cancel and leave with me. As a manager your job is to make things right and if your employees did  something they weren't supposed to do you should still try to make the situation right and you did none of that. Lastly, I'd like to mention that I was planning on re-joining. Now I will just go to the new location with new owner down the street!
Negative	Terrible customer service, why make a reservation if you are just going to make someone wait an hour to be seated? The food is nothing spectacular. Similar to cafeteria food honestly. The salad was dumped out of a bag onto a plate. Over priced cafeteria food at that.. I have tried this place twice now just to give them the benefit of doubt. I even ordered the spaghetti this time thinking that maybe that would be awesome since after all you are the spaghetti factory.. nope it's disgusting
Negative	"We keep returning to Le Village Buffet year after year - my kids love the tradition of going back to eat every year, and we keep getting the Buffet of Buffets pass -, and we continue to see it declining in offerings.  I think anyone paying full price would be disappointed.  We went both for dinner and breakfast - both times avoiding the line by making OpenTable reservations.  

For dinner, they seemed to have fewer and poorer offerings this year.  There is no more lamb, tri-tip or pork belly - or elaborate French dishes.  Cassoulet and a dry duck a l'orange seemed to be it.

The crepes are still fantastic, but they have reduced the types offered and also downgraded ingredients - no more mixed berries or chopped hazelnuts.  They only had one crepemaker working during both the dinner and breakfast rush, so waits can be very long.  

Service was good during dinner, rushed over breakfast.  

All in all, it was disappointing.  I wouldn't go back without the kids pressuring us to do so."
Negative	"I don't know if the oxygen works or not. What I did realize is that they hold you captive with the oxygen tubes in your nose and then try and sell you overpriced massage gadgets. I had wanted to try it just for fun but what i quickly found out is that It was not worth the time or the money.

The only reason it gets two stars is because the girl behind the counter was nice. That's it."
Negative	"The worst of the worst. One of the lowest rung Walmarts.

As at most horrid places, some employees are nice and do their best...

... but mostly, this is an extra incompetent Wal-Mart. Too many rude people that don't know what they're doing.

The entire store reeks of something like sour milk. The store is literally going bad. Literally! 

How can they not notice this, and do something about this?

Computer systems and credit card machines are not maintained. They demagnetized one of my brand new cards. On the one machine that is better maintained, my credit cards do not like to run here due to this being an extra fraud prone location.

Strict no photos policy, so there's no proof of their horridness. 

What's funny is that I actually got stopped taking a phone pic of their well priced, organic green onions. A picture I was taking in an attempt to show & say something good. That's how upside down this location is. They foul up even attempts to say something positive! 

Grouchy, valueless, backwards priority holding bastards. This always starts at the top, so my recommendation is that the managers should be let go.

In short, best if avoided. 

There's better Walmarts and Targets around. For some purchases, you are honestly better off going to Alibaba or AliExpress. It's not like WM adds anything positive to the Made in China buying experience. 

Walmart is literally just a retail face of Alibaba. Huge markups for little to no service, and the very real risk of catching a bad disease with the type of hygiene practiced at this unusually foul location."
Negative	"I've eaten at Bandung many times, both in the restaurant and via delivery. It's always very tasty and fast! However, I just had a pretty terrifying realization -- this restaurant does not take allergies very seriously.

I have an egg allergy and I've made that explicitly clear every time I've eaten at the restaurant. This evening, after ordering, I got a phone call informing me that they have *always* marinated their meats in egg. How this hasn't made me sick in the past is beyond me, but hopefully this can serve as a warning to all you fellow allergy sufferers out there: Bandung may not take your allergies seriously and may serve you food that contains the allergens you've warned them about. 

If you have any serious food allergies, I'd recommend avoiding this place entirely."
Negative	Very slow service and on top of that the employees are very rude.  The food is not good enough to deal with the slow service and rude employees, I would suggest going somewhere else.
Negative	"Terrible Customer Service!

I made arrangements to be home for the grooming appointment I had schedule at 9:30AM. At 9:45AM contacted the owner because the groomer was not here yet, and I just wanted to confirm that they were still coming. (They should have contacted me letting me know they would be late.) The groomer was still over an hour late, even after texting and saying she would be right there. Even so I understood things happen and simply asked if I could then be given a small discount for the inconvenience. The Groomer agreed and offered me a $10 discount which I accepted. 
Great right?
NO!
After the groomer finished with my pup she came to the door with the owner on the phone and proceeded to tell me they would not give me a discount because it is not their fault she was late. There was construction etc.... The groomer also lied RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME several times saying she was only a half hour late. She kept telling me they have a 30 minutes window of grace period etc... But I kept repeating that she was far later then 30 minutes! Regardless she continued to refuse me a discount even after already promising one to me. SO Unprofessional!
In the end they said no you have to pay the full amount and I simply said, fine and handed over my card explaining I would not be using their services again. She then says forget it, and leaves without charging me at all.... Seriously? So instead of just giving me a $10 discount you would rather lose a customer and not get paid at all?

I am furious and will never use their services again..."
Negative	"I was so excited when I got the 20% off on entire sales purchase. When I was ready to pay, didn't realize the coupon wouldn't start until the next day. The girl was not sure about the coupon and checked with the older guy at the other cashier. He said, ""You guys need to read!"" OMG! Okay, I knew It's my fault and I was okay to pay without the coupon. Did he really need to say that? I remembered him and he's always the rude one! No smile, terrible customer service!! Well, not going to this location anymore! Don't need anyone like him to ruin my day! Too bad I couldn't give zero star here!"
Negative	Sadly, the quality seems to have dropped here and the portions size shrunk. There was brown/limp lettuce in my salad even though they were making them fresh. Probably need to find a new fave Greek spot.
Negative	"Carrying all the standard stuff, Hudson News has several location in Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport.

It's way overpriced, even for airports.  A typically $1.39 bag of chips will set you back $4.49 at Hudson.  A $0.75 candy bar costs $3.49.  'Nuff said."
Negative	"Brought my car in for an emissions test. By coincidence, my car battery was changed a couple of days earlier, and the mechanic told me only that the test ""might not work"" if the car computer hasn't reset yet. But he said it ""should be ok"" since I've been driving it since then. He failed to mention that the test ""not working"" results in a fail, and that I'd lose the $30 fee and have to get it re-tested (I would have waited if I'd known).

Upset at not having been warned of this, I complained to both the guy at the front desk, and later to the manager. Both were completely unsympathetic, and took a ""not our problem"" attitude. Even the head-office for Oil Changers only delegated responsibility, saying that the franchise is independently owned, and that I have to deal with them.

Be warned! This location does not care about you. They will do the bare minimum, and shirk responsibility if anything goes wrong as a result of their failure to provide you with essential information."
Negative	"How do I give ZERO stars?

So, like most people, I tend to go here because it's super close - but after as many strikes as they've had, this last straw broke the camel's back.

I've been clipped here twice, once while bleeding the ""technician"" giggled and said ""sorry"" like it was nothing to be apologetic about. I called the day before Canada Day to see if they were open and they told me to come in at 10:30 the next day - showed up and it was closed. On Friday I went to get my nails done (acrylic full set) and she totally did a horrible job. They're uneven, thick, and just look like absolute garbage. When I asked about the uneven, she told me that my nail was ""like that"" and after I politely asked a few times that she fixed it, she finally did. Best part, by Sunday (2 days later, I only had 8 nails left on, as two had fallen off.

I will never go back here again, Kim's Nails at Queen/Dufferin is 100000000x better."
Negative	vegi sandwich was slimy and didn't stay together. restaurant was dirty.  mirrors and pictures looked like they hadn't been attended to in a long time. floors and table were filthy.  no one was available to pick up plates or wipe tables down. I don't think I would return.
Negative	RUN DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! You have very long waits even though no other patients are in the office,if your have an appointment  plan to sit for an hour, when you ask direct questions the office staff they appear to be unable to respond in a professional manner, they yelled... yes I said yelled my personal information to other staff. They wanted me to submit to tests but would not tell me what they were testing me for or the reason for the test as it had NOTHING to do with my visit, you can draw your own conclusion about why a Dr office would bill for unnecessary and inappropriate tests $$$. I now have a new dr and will advise others to Stay away!
Negative	I called today to set up an appointment for a root canal. When I told the receptionist what kind of dental insurance I have, she proceeded to tell me that, even though they accepted my insurance, I would have to pay out of pocket (over $1000) because they have a really hard time getting in touch with my insurer and they would reimburse me when they got paid. Why would I EVER agree to that?!? Why on earth should I have to pay ANYTHING when I have insurance? This is an unacceptable way to run a practice. Better to just not accept that particular kind of insurance rather than making the patient pay for it!! I'm absolutely APPALLED by this. This is a problem between you and the insurer, NOT the patient. Practices like this are part of the problem with insurance in this country. So now I, the patient who is in pain, have to find a different endodontist. Unbelievably ridiculous.
Negative	Rude...all the time...there is something going on with this location. Everyone is rude and angry. I've used the drive thru numerous times and each time...rudeness. I love Dunkin Coffee...I hate this location
Negative	Honestly the guy working tonight was awesome. He was working like a dog....my issue was that for a 24/7 establishment that's got a line out the end why is there only one worker? He's taking all the orders and making the food and cleaning the dishes?? We had to order at the window after getting stuck in the drive thru. Poor guy didn't have time to handle everything going on. Get it together.
Negative	"I've been to Sun Devil Stadium four times. One was for the USC/ASU game two years ago, the recent CAL/ASU game and two AZ Cardinal Games prior to them moving to Glendale. It's by far the worst run stadium I've ever been to.  For the Cardinal games, they ran out of beer in the 2nd quarter both times. I'm still surprised that they actually had Super Bowls in this pathetic stadium. For the ASU/USC game, we were down a couple touchdowns and ASU fans were cocky as hell thinking they were going to upset USC. Sam Keller bowing to the crowd at half time showed me to have little respect for scum devils. Low and behold, ASU flames out and USC rolls in the second half behind Leinart and Bush.  

I was at the ASU/Cal game last weekend because my co-worker is a ASU alum and had an extra ticket. I will admit ASU was the better team, but that's not saying much against a much-maligned CAL team that has now lost 3 straight games.  I love how the AZ Republic called it a ""Statement Win."" You're #4 in the BCS and you beat a team having lost 3 games in a row and that's your statement win? Are you kidding me. My co-worker even was embarassed to admit that.  What's more pathetic was the fact the students rushed the field. You're #4 in the BCS and you beat a team you should have beaten..and you rush the field?!!! Another sign of a marginal program. By the way, my co-worker agrees with me on that one as well. 

I find it funny that all the ASU fans (ie. Pierre Trudeau) are high on themselves because they are actually relevant. I guess ASU gets to have some glory every 10 years. Every marginal athletic program has it's day. I am sure they'll find a way to mess it up this year."
Negative	HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! First they can't get the number of how many tacos I want correct, then why add lettuce to the side when I specifically say NO LETTUCE because I am allergic.  Yes, it is a stupid allergy but it is an allergy just the same!  Whenn I called to enlighten them they hung up on me!  Never going back!
Negative	"The reality is 5 service with 1 food ....sad really. 
I still tipped the waitress as she did her job, that being said we paid $60 to leave with the question of why?   

All done with local family restaurants."
Negative	The staff was very polite, but overworked or undertrained. Not really sure. Food was good-as usual, but it took way too long to be seated, had to ask to see a menu, too long for the food to come out and way way too long to pay. Not sure we will return to this location.
Negative	Really wanted to check this place out but the 2 girls at the door were so rude we turned right around & took our business elsewhere. Didn't plan 2 eat at Dicks!
Negative	"Maya Day and Nightclub might be the worst concept ever.  How can you be a ""beach club"" with a pool and not allow sandals at night?  Riddle me that..."
Negative	"I will never patronize another Bar Louie ever again. $3.20 for a coke? Seriously???
Not a rum and coke.. but just a coke... simple fountain beverage.  Not even a refill.. just one (1).  I wonder how much a glass of water from the facet would cost?? 

If they overcharge for 1 coke, what else are they over charging??

To me this is a red flag. .. think about it..

Very disappointing.. never ever again.."
Negative	I was really excited to check this place out. My 2nd visit deterred me from going again though. My big toe was sore for almost a week and then I had puss come out of the corner. I had a feeling she cut too short and the pedicure Polish job was horrible, you can literally see a good thick line where she didn't do the additional Coats all the way down so you can see the 1st coat like a border to the rest. My visit was 3 1/2 hours and I had to go back the next day to do a redo on design which I had the wait another hour when I was expected and there right when they opened. Unfortunate.
Negative	I don't know what happened to this place, I used to love going there. But last two times I've had worst sandwich and service of any place I've been. They act as if they could care less!
Negative	"My friend and I were heading to Toronto to see the Red Sox play the Jays.  In looking for hotels, we considered location, price and reviews.  Since this hotel was close, moderately priced and well reviewed, we thought we'd give it a shot.

Location: If you are going to the Rogers Centre, then you have a good location with this hotel.  It's about 4-5 blocks away from the Rogers Centre.  You can actually see the RC from the street in front of the hotel.  The hotel is located in downtown, so you are merely a bus ride or train ride away from anything.  However, if you are looking for a quick bite to eat, there aren't many food places around.  We had to hunt down a Dunkin Donuts and Timmy Horton's for food.

Price: The price was moderate.  We paid $160 for Friday (through the hotel itself) and $125 for Saturday (through Expedia).  We had asked for two queen beds.  Mind you, we made the reservations 4 months in advance.  However, they gave us a king.

Reviews:  The reviews all say that it's good for the money and the location.  This is true.  However, our experience wasn't as grand as everyone elses.  First of all, parking is a nightmare.  They basically rape you to pay $35/night to park in their underground lot.  We were told we were guaranteed a spot to park.  They lie.  You can find parking at other garages around the hotel for $10-$15 less for the day.  When we got there, they were allowing those people coming for the game to park in their lot rather than saving space for hotel guests.  Fast forward to the next day - our hotel room was never even cleaned.  No new towels, no cleaning our bins or making our bed.  Nothing.  Mentioned it to the front desk and they claimed they were booked solid all weekend and that a letter went around saying if we really NEEDED to have our room made up, to call them.  Really??  Why did I pay you $160 a night if it's such an inconvenience to make up my room?  Insane.

There is a restaurant in house, however, be prepared to pay through the nose for food you'd get anywhere else at a decent price.  The hotel pool and gym are located on the 2nd floor (with the restaurant, which is strangely odd as you can smell the chlorine into the restaurant).  The pool is super tiny (imagine putting 4 sandboxes together) and the gym has 5 pieces of cardio equipment and some free weights.

The decor is alright, albeit, cheesey.  The bathrooms have standing shower stalls only (no tubs), pull out couches and offer free Wi-Fi.  The beds are hard as sleeping on rocks as are the pillows.

I would definitely recommend a Best Western over this location."
Negative	"Womp womp womp. Out of all the places to eat in Downtown Summerlin and this place was chosen (not by me!).

We arrived during a busy lunch, which may have attributed to the slow service. Luckily our server was overly nice to us about the wait time. Funny thing is, I called in and specifically mentioned I was having a business lunch and wanted to be assured a table, but they would not take my reservation because it was not 6+ people. The hostess assured me we would be able to get a table, when I arrived it was packed and I had heart palpitations foreseeing my misery in front of my clients when I wouldn't be able to acquire a table! 

We still ended up with a table outside on the patio, thankfully.

Little black bugs flew around us the whole time we ate. Swiping at bugs and trying to enjoy a business lunch is horrible. I think they may live in the green bushes that surround the patio. 

I ordered the Blackended Salmon Salad. Came out with some decent lettuce, some lettuce had brown spots, and some lettuce was wilted - and the dressing was HEAVY. Also, this salad was kind of boring - it just LOOKED bland. There was no garnishes, and very few croutons. The salmon was the saving grace - it was blackened nicely, with some tasty spices, but not over-powering. Plus, the salmon was quite large - no skimping on size.

I think they are still working out their kinks, but with so many other options to eat at in DS, I don't think I will return here. Perhaps their original location on Lake Mead is better?"
Negative	I walk in and it's hotter inside then outside and this is Las Vegas.  TURN ON YOUR AIR CONDITIONING.   The place opened an hour ago and empty and it's DIRTY.   The outside tables look like they haven't been cleaned in a month .  The door is more dirty then the tables . GROSS The staff is not that friendly too.
Negative	"First buffet I've been to in Vegas and it was crap.

Most of the food was dried out. Even when they brought fresh chicken parm, it was tough and chewy.

The curry chicken was good the first time but the when they remade it, it was disgusting. 

They lack consistency in their food.

The pork buns were dry. 

The establishment failed to tell us we got free champagne with our brunch. They also failed to mention drinks were free (soft drinks, juices etc). 

Will never be back here. I advise going to a different buffet"
Negative	"Two years later and the food experience is not improved.  Three of us, $250
And no one had even a decent meal.  My wife's trout was inedible with greasy potatoes,  my stroganoff had tons of noodles, almost no beef and was cold.  My draft beer was luke warm.  The space is a five,  the food is a minus five, so I guess a one is the only choice.
Why would anyone waste this great place to serve such below average food?
Get a chef who is not lazy and serve a better than average menu and fare.
Also, at your prices, bring back the relish dish.
By the way, we had an 8:00 reservation and were not seated til almost 8:30,
Cooling our heels in the lobby."
Negative	Walk-ins are most certainly not accomodated. Per the website it says walk-ins are welcome, however, when I walked in I was told they could make me an appt. 4 hours later?? No thanks, I will go elsewhere.
Negative	It was 2:30 in the afternoon, not a busy time at all. We pull up to the drive thru and they said they need a minute because of a shift change. We didn't know what we wanted so we said that was ok. After discussing what we wanted for 5 minutes, we told them we were ready. The lady then told us we needed to wait another 10 minutes because they were busy inside??? We pulled around and saw a total of 6 customers inside, which most of them already had food. Horrible service, horrible priced food which we didn't even get to try, and terrible workers. I'd advise everyone to stay away from this place
Negative	Unfortunately, this hotel was awful. There was a flood light shining into my room, lighting up the ceiling, and no way to clos the curtains.  Hw can anyone sleep in a fully lighted room.
Negative	"During a Las Vegas stay last week, my wife and I purchased tickets to ""Vegas! The Show"".  We got to enjoy about 20 minutes of what was a terrific show by the performers. Suddenly, a loud alarm was sounding and beacons were flashing. After a couple of minutes, an announcement was made that Security had been notified. That was it. My wife and I evacuated out of the theatre, soon followed by a crowd, gathering by the box office. Needless to say, due to recent events, everyone were uneasy about the situation and not knowing what was going on. No further explanations were given as to what was the cause for the alarm. The alarm kept going on and off for about an hour. We never got to see the rest of the show. We asked for a refund as did many others but were told refunds would not be issued. My wife and I left. We returned to the box office the following morning, and were again denied a refund or any compensation. I do not understand how folks can remain in business with such poor customer service and utter disregard for customers and their lack of communication during an alarm situation. I would not recommend this establishment."
Negative	Ummm, drove 20 minutes to get here to find out it was cash only.  Long way to success for these guys.  Placing a note on the door or even better on their website would be great.  Do not plan on returning or supporting idiots who suck at having a business.
Negative	"It was recommended by Yelp along with special offer. My family ordered all sorts of ice cream and Boba tea. Ice cream was good but the guy at the counter gave us $1.00 discount, saying the discount  was $3.50.
I guess he doesn't understand English."
Negative	Terrible. From the moment we walked in no one greeted us or even acknowledged us for a good 5 minutes. As we were about to walk us someone finally came to the desk and sat us. FYI no half sushi orders at tables, so we moved 2 feet over to the bar and it was ok... kinda strange. But what I couldn't deal with was dirty menus & dirty table tops. The sushi was just so-so. Definitely not worth $28 per person for all you can eat. Skimpy servings on the nigiri too. Definitely won't be back here. Oh and all the rolls have cream cheese wtf... I hate that!
Negative	Ordered pizza online.  Estimated delivery was 6:17p.  It arrived late,  at 6:42p and was room temp.  It had cooled down so much that the cheese had hardened.  Here's an idea - don't send your delivery drivers out with so many order that the last 1 or 2 to be delivered are cold. We're 2.2 miles from the store,  there's no excuse.
Negative	"ummm... not so much. The band that was playing was good, the bartenders serving me were great, the bouncer at the door gave me a great ego-boosting compliment, but then I had to correct some weird drunk chick who I guess got jealous of his attention. (whatever)  Anyways... it was more the clientele that was a turn-off. I actually had a ""Night at the Roxbury"" moment. seriously..."
Negative	Literally the worst service I've ever had. Took 15 min for a person to come service. They didn't even bring us menus. Had to go get them myself. Didn't come and collect the payment. Had to go to the bar to pay. The food was ok.
Negative	I went here with my buddy for his 40th birthday...I have never been so dissatisfied. We did the chef tasting menu with wine pairings. So from the beginning. ..the service was pushy..to move the table fast...the wine pairing was the same although we ordered different food courses..way to sweet.tge courses looked pretty...but were not even worth tasting. 650.00 dinner!  Never will go back...go to another place.
Negative	"WARNING: There have been a high amount of break-ins and damage to cars parked in the parking lot. One car parked next to me had their entire window shattered. Another guest I talked to in the parking lot had his windshield bashed in. 

My car was damaged on the rear bumper. When I contacted management they told me they had a description of the vehicle that hit my car. Turns out it was a separate incident of hit and run that also happened this week but the only thing they knew was that a red car hit a truck parked in the lot and then the driver sped away. 

Pretty negligent of the owners to not have cameras installed and running. Now guests like myself are stuck taking care of the damages on our own."
Negative	"Over the years, I have stayed at Quail Hollow and held events all with a positive experience. 

However, the facility and service has really gone down hill.  My recent 3-day stay was very disappointing. The hotel is not well maintained and not very clean. There was a leak in the wall in my hotel room that had not been repaired. The pillows on the bed smelled, there was hair in the bathroom and a dead bug on the floor when I arrived, they ran out of coffee for in-room coffee makers and the last day, they did not make the bed. I would not recommend."
Negative	"What I got: $20 massage at around 2pm

Good: they go out of their way to close the curtains and doors to reduce light and noise

Bad: (lots)
* masseuse cover your eyes and massage with one hand and use their phone on the other. Some masseuse will overcompensate if you talk to them and catch them in the act.
* aggressive tipping standard. They will give you flak and tell you to ""NEVER RETURN"" if you tip less than $10. Stand your ground or quiet them with a good reason (""they were on their phone""). 
* crammed seating. Other masseuse may bump into 
* next door is an arcade or something; you may hear bumping noises there. 

They clearly wrangle in customers with a low entry point but offer too little."
Negative	Won't quote on a small repair without getting oil change ......    refused to quote me until I got in line for the oil change ..... not a smart way to build business.  I would call it bait and switch at its finest ! !    also OVER Priced when it comes to standard oil changes.
Negative	"//OVERALL\\
Very outdated, which would be okay if it at least seemed kept up with in areas that mattered, like the carpets in the room or even basic hospitality etiquette. Okay amount of parking (more in the back). The half-cleaned graffiti on the side of the building was a little worrisome. Overall, this is the worst Holiday Inn Express I've ever stayed at, this is definitely not like most HIEs. 

We booked a 2 bedroom, which was clean enough at first glance. But certain things should be updated or redone. The keys are finicky. Have to slide them out at the right speed, slow but not too slow. I noticed even housekeeping had trouble getting doors to unlock.

//STAY\\
The bathroom ceiling in our room looked like it had been previously treated for mold, but it looked like the ceiling should've been repainted. Unfortunately two of us took long showers and coupled with the poor ventilation and improperly treated ceiling, it would start dripping orange after our showers. The whole ceiling would just start to condensate like a glass of ice water in summer.

Every day we dreaded coming back into the room, because it just had this overwhelming dank, musty smell. It's evident that it's been a very long time since the carpets have been changed. Also, I noticed that the housekeeper kept clean towels balanced directly on the lip of the trash bin of her linen/utility cart.

//STAFF\\
The staff is so-so. Never during our stay did we ever get a ""hello/good morning"" from the Front Desk staff, not even during check-in. Most of them seemed to just stare at you whenever you were coming in or leaving. Room and Breakfast staff were much friendlier. 

//CONVENIENCE\\
The great things about the hotel are that it's very near a GO station so you can easily get to downtown without your car, and it's very convenient to Scarborough Town Centre, Pacific Mall, and not too far a drive over to other areas in the 'burbs."
Negative	Store in general is clean maybe cleaner than most thrift stores but, they need a lot of help with their customer service employees are not friendly at all and their prices are a hit or miss. They offer NO sales at all which is a bummer. I personally will not donate here but that's just me. When they first opened I would shop her constantly because their prices were more affordable, now I will definitely take my business elsewhere.
Negative	The worst customer service!!! I was here and given a 'surprise voucher' at the entrance. When I went to the cashier he stated that I received $5 off my purchase. After going home and reviewing my invoice the credit was never applied! I even emailed customer service they apologized offering an online credit which cant even be used in stores. Wont be shopping here anymore so disappointing.
Negative	"Starbuckkkksssss!

My son and I frequent these, and today I was NOT happy at all! I ordered a childs hot cocoa and a venti tea. He asked me if I just wanted a black tea or a lemonade mixed with tea; I opted for the Arnie Palmer. BIG MISTAKE! 

My tea tasted like it was made of old lemonade and I guess tasted moldy. My sons child cocoa was half full and cold. Not warm, COLD! My friend suggested I go tell them, but I hate to bother... even though I paid 6$ for the 2 drinks. 

I just sat there and drank my spoiled tea and my son finished off his half full cocoa. LAME!

Ill stick to the Boca Park one."
Negative	"It must be too hot for the douche bag salesmen to come assist anyone. I walked around for 20 minutes going through the different jeeps and even tried to wave a guy over lmao. GFY LHM!
Another update! A guy from LHM contacted me to let me know that he monitors yelp and he saw my post. I felt harassed when he Insisted that the service was not as bad I felt it was and he reminded me that I did not wait as log as I thought I had waited for my service. This guy had the nerve to tell me that even after a prior complaint his service guys didn't perform their job satisfactory with my car wash and I should have come back in and let him know it was a horrible job. You knew I was coming, you knew I expected at least mediocre service and if your people can't provide that service there is nothing I can do to help you. I'm sure this guy will call me again to harass me about my post. Next time the conversation will be recorded so I can report it his supervisor! Thanks LHM!!!!"
Negative	Where to start... So everyone I know have always been a fan of Claim Jumpers.. BUT I must say... Over the years, the food has really just gone to sh!t!! Every time we go back, it seems to be worse and worse.  My recent visit was pretty much catastrophic.  There was a bug in the starter salad to start... Then we had our entrees, my steak was overcooked.  I ordered. Medium an I got wayyyyy overcooked well done.  Hubby ordered chicken n ribs, hi chicken was bleeding, undercooked! So I had to complain to the server.. GM came over and apologized.  He removed the 2 entrees from our bill.  This was the only reason I gave 2 stars... The service wasn't bad, the food was! I will definitely no be returning to this location... And maybe No more Claim Jumpers as well..
Negative	"Like the last person posting, I have been going to Dolce for quite some time.  I really like my stylist,  Heather but she is away .  In her absence, I did not have a preference for someone to cut my son's hair.  We came by on the previous night hoping to get a walk in appointment. When that was unavailable and while we were in clear sight, we made an appointment for the following morning.   We walked  in and the stylist, greeted us with, "" this will be interesting"".  Did I mention my son was black?  
There was only one other chair in use, so I think they chose this guy on purpose.  He did not touch my son's hair, but pointed to it.  We described the cut and he asked my 10 year old son which blade several times, even after I explained that he was 10 and had no idea.  The cut was short on sides and longer on top.  I then put fauxhawk into my phone and showed him several different examples.  The first one was a white kid, well that wouldn't work, the second a black kid but my son's hair was shorter on top and the third was a black guy who's hair looked like little springs.  The hairdresser informed me that - THEY get perms to get their hair to look like that.  I mentioned that my son's hair looked exactly like that when it was clean.  He told me it wasn't .  I guess all black guys have identical hair.  I hopped up found a manager who seemed nice but not helpful and I left.
We popped into Master Cuts and a woman about 55 who was not in any way trying to look hip, greeted us at the door.  We told her what we wanted and she said sure.  I asked again to make sure and she looked at me like I was crazy, she was after all a hairdresser and this was hair.  Probably saved $40.00 and he loves his hair."
Negative	Two stars is generous.  The place is clean and the service has been good.  I cant figure out why people like this  place.  The subs are not good.  I've tried at least five different kinds and they just are not good.  They are not bad....just not good.  They have no real taste.  If you ask them to go heavy on the mayo, they are better.
Negative	Terrible service.  No maid service 1 day ( no the privacy sign wasn't hung), locked out of room 3rd night 1 hr later get someone to unlock it.  Bath drain clogged first use.  Wrong drinks brought 2x at buffet.  Checkout called 2x for bellhop service 90 minutes later just muscled the bags (none on wheels) to valet myself.  Customer service lacking.
Negative	"Second Gordon restaurant in few months. Please know: huge fan of the show, etc. 

Second restaurant, second disappointment. Food was good but:
- portions are tiny
- ridicoulously overpriced
- terrible service at many levels: 10 minutes wait for the warer order, 15
More to order drinks and 20 to order food; no napkins; 5 waitresses at front door doing nothing and a bunch pf customers trying to catch their attention; horrible outfits, especially woman (btw not a good idea to have the Sun's headline celebrating the folkland's win on a dress...)
- the fountain drinks suck. Coke was watery and with a very weird backtaste; asked for an outlet to plug my phone and the waitress would not even know what to do. 
- did i say overpriced?!? 17 bucks for 3 miniscule sliders with no side. 

Bottom line: Gordon you're full of s***, you talk about consistency but that's what this is: inconsistent and not worth the money."
Negative	"DO NOT have the waffles there.  I ordered it this morning and it was rock hard and inedible.  I had a hard time cutting through it with a knife.

The servers were very friendly and the atmosphere was good. But I will not be coming back.

My wife's breakfast was french toast which was better than the waffles, but nothing great.

Just as an FYI, it's a food court location.  But waffles should be edible."
Negative	Nice place, huge facility. Not enough/ big enough bathrooms. The cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable. I have never been to a convention of this size where water and coffee was not offered free of charge. Two bottles of water 6.00.... Not sure if is an option the organization didn't ask for or if it is just general practice for the facility. I am not asking for bottles of water just a place to fill a cup. Clean the restrooms once in a while when 5000 people are attending a conference....... A few minor changes would earn this place another two stars.
Negative	So the place is most definitely unattractive, I will never dine in again. The service is horrible, I waited about 45 min for my food and only saw my waitress maybe twice. The atmosphere is not inviting, I felt uncomfortable however the sushi rolls for 2.99 were delicious! The hibachi was alright the cook uses to much water to steam the meat and chicken to cook faster because he has a lot of orders but that makes it loose it's hibachi taste. It doesn't have the flatiron taste it's more like healthy steamed chicken lol. So I don't think id order the hibachi  again.
Negative	I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I was here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediately.
Negative	"This is the restaurant of bits and pieces, and I have to say that I haven't been so let down in a while.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high based on the strength of the reviews here.  Taste-wise, they have the fragrant spices that I so love about good Northern Chinese cooking.  The soup in the soup noodle was flavourful, the spices plentiful.  We had the Dong Ting duck noodle and this steamed chicken in a bamboo thing that in menu pictures had looked so tantalizing and spicy.  Both dishes ended up being made from the tiniest parts of the respective fowl.  The chicken bits were mostly chopped up leg bones, so we were spitting out bone shards with almost every bite.  It wasn't that spicy either.  The duck bits looked like there were the butt tips of several ducks - all nubbly fat globs with a shred of meat attached.  We also had the seafood 'bird's nest' (seafood presented in a fried noodle nest that I thought was average and overpriced.

As this place is relatively new in a not-yet full new-ish plaza, the restaurant was clean and bright with nice decor.  However, with all the other great Chinese restaurants in the area, I wouldn't come here again."
Negative	I was very pleased to receive a response to my review that I'd previously posted. I was very disappointed in the situation that took place however, I do believe that the  Domino's corporates care about their customers. I actually mentioned my experience to a friend of mine and was informed that she too had a similar situation happen when her teenage son ordered from this peticular location. It's a little disheartening to think of how many other people may have been short changed by their delivery driver's. Hopefully this will be adressed and not tolerated.
Negative	Look, it's a good, cheap place to eat breakfast when you're hungover after a night of debauchery on Freemont street. Nothing is exceptional, nor is it terrible. Like a mediocre Denny's, just a tad cheaper (especially if you are a Binion's player's club member or whatever). It worked in a pinch!
Negative	I had my car detailed at this place and when I got my car back saw that the driver's seat leather was spotted an orange color and the original color faded. My car is fairly new and in excellent condition including the interior. One employee told me they use rug shampoo and hard bristle brushes on leather. I took the car back and talked to the manager who had another employee bring back a spray bottle and one of the hard bristle brushes. He began to spray and brush very roughly to my dismay. I requested him to stop a number of times because I could see more color being removed. He refused to stop scrubbing. I have gone back at least five times to see the owner who is conveniently never there when I have been told he would be there. I have left my phone numbers and requested he call, but he never calls back. I got an estimate and to replace and repair the leather is going to cost $350. It has been over a month since this happened, and, at this point, I have realized the owner of this place is not going to cover the expense of repairing the damage his business caused. If you value your car, stay away from Desert Auto Wash.
Negative	We had originally made a reservation at Thrifty, but when we got there and were in the process of paying for the car, the agent started rolling off her confusing spiel about how if anything happens to the car, we could be stuck with paying for not only the damage, but the time the car is out of commission, yada, yada, yada, and the insurance to cover this was $17 and change.  She couldn't even explain whether or not we'd still owe anything if there was an accident.  And she wasn't even nice about it.  After my husband signed everything, he saw that the bill went from $259 to nearly $400!  When I pointed out that $259 + $17 does not equal nearly $400, she said that it was $17 A DAY!  Truly, she acted as though theirs was the only game in town and it didn't make any difference to her whether we rented from them or not.  We canceled out the transaction - for which she flat out refused to give us any type of receipt - and then we started looking at the other companies.  We tried Dollar, but then found out it was also owned by Hertz (as is Thrifty), so the deal would be exactly the same.  Then we saw Advantage and decided to give it a try.  For about $100 less than what we would have paid at Thrifty or Dollar, we got a full-sized car which was automatically covered 100% by their Loss Damage Waiver.  Plus the agent at Advantage was so much more pleasant and friendly than that person at Thrifty.  For us, Advantage is the way to go from now on any time it is an option.
Negative	"I used to love this place, but this week was the last straw. Had my teeth cleaned by Laurie and left with pain (she was very abrasive). Turns out she took out a filling when she cleaned my teeth and now have to pay and have it fixed elsewhere.  Won't go back.

Earlier in the year went in complaining of a tooth pain and thought I might have a cavity. They couldn't see anything so they sent me to an endodontist who agreed, no cavity, just that I needed a new crown on another tooth (not the one that was hurting).  So I went to another endodontist and dentist for more thorough scans and a second opinion.  They found the cavity and fixed it."
Negative	Terrible!! The staff at front desk is awful! Went for our best friends wedding there!( their wedding planner is amazing) just the night front desk lady Denise was the rudest person! She was so mean and told us she didn't care we called the manager on her! Curtains In rooms do not shut with big lights right outside
Negative	I'll be honest, I heard fantastic things about this place but I was really disappointed. I went in for a full set with gel polish. The tech had issues finding the right shape, I asked for an almond shape and got a round one but in filing them, they too short to fix. The actual acrylic is uneven and lumpy and the gel polish is spotty and has bumps in it. She cut my cuticles pretty badly and the skin on my fingers are peeling. It's true what they say, you get what you pay for. I doubt I'll ever return.
Negative	Seriously? The line to the customer service desk is out the door and they only have two girls manning it. This is ridiculous! There are five other associate in the vicinity; one standing at the counter playing on computer, three others playing on a phone and one other just watching the line get bigger. C'mon now!
Negative	"This used to be my favorite restaurant locally.  Mostly because of the patio and the view.  The food was always good too. But this time the food was disgusting. The tartare was made with mayo and literally slathered in it.  It was gross. The Pate was hard and dry.  Even the Brie and chicken sandwich was covered in mayo.  The drinks were beyond over priced - even for the strip.  After waiting an hour for patio seating it was barely shaded.  

But, the service was superb!  It's simply not a French inspired restaurant anymore. It's another conglomerate taking tourists money pretending to be something it's not. The only thing it has going for it is the Bellagio fountains. And FYI $13 for valet parking is so ridiculous. Going from $0 to $13 - give me a break.  I cannot believe anyone visits this city. I live here so I'm screwed."
Negative	This is a scam site. Do not use them at all. Do not call. Avoid them like the plague. They lie and take your money. Does not deserve the one star. Total scam.
Negative	"I've been here several times, always expecting it to be better than it ever actually is.  I could complain about the prices, but I think my cousin and I simply agree that all BBQ joints are overpriced.
So I'll complain about the food.  And the service.  I went in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  Our waitress looked sweaty and kinda high.  We missed the lunch menu (which actually only has 2 items) so we both ordered dinners.  My pulled pork was good enough and my okra was milliseconds away from being carbon.  We both inexplicably had to pay extra for the side orders that we chose to go with our meals.  My cousin said the cornbread (an extra 75 cents for no apparent reason) was the best she'd ever had at a restaurant and she enjoyed the hot links but when our bill came to over $30 we both thought that was about $15 too much.  My bbq beans were alright, nothing special.  I wish I had just ordered their ""special"", seasoned waffle fries topped with pulled bbq, cheese, and jalapenos.  
Our waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly.   I'm on the fence whether or not to just ban the restaurant from my list of possibilities...I love bbq but ugh."
Negative	This place smells. Against my better judgment we actually sat down and ate here. Maybe my standards are too high I cannot believe that anybody would give this place a good review. My boyfriend got sick after eating here. There's nothing worse than bad sushi.
Negative	The bread is small and dry. The meat was well flavored but not warm.... let alone hot. The sides are tiny.  12.00 for a half sandwich and a spoon of sale, and cup of soup.... they should try harder. Great service.
Negative	Holy crap is this place overrated. How the heck does it have 4.5 stars? There are so many places in Charlotte that serve similar food only much better. The biscuit was stale, the chicken was flavorless... Disappointing.
Negative	Rates seemed reasonable, so we called for pet setting and there was never a reply. Not sure if this businesses is still open. If it is, it would have been very nice if the business owner was able to politely say No and call back to refuse to pet sitting.
Negative	"Nasty bar maids and prison quality food.  If that floats your boat, go there.  They don't even serve your food,  you have to go to the kitchen several times as your ""food"" is ready.  So many other good places. Plus you can't get a beer until they abscond
Your credit card."
Negative	"I came here a few times, but definitely will not be back because of my last two experiences. 
I called in a phone order and the girl who answered the phone was extremely rude. She made me feel like I was bothering her. After taking my order, she did not thank me or even say good bye. She simply hung up on me. I was so upset that I ended up not picking up my order. Foolishly I thought maybe she was having a bad day, and decided to give this place another chance. We went for dinner while they were full and waited a few minutes for a table to open up. Once a table left, we started to walk towards it and the same waitress (I recognized her voice) yelled ""Can you wait so I can clear the table"" from across the restaurant (while rolling her eyes). We weren't planning on sitting, we just wanted to stand next to it in case another party walked in. And even if we were about to sit, you should NEVER yell at your customers, let alone from across the room. I believe this is a small family-runned restaurant and maybe she's just there because of her family, but she should probably be working in the kitchen instead of with customers. She obviously doesn't know anything about customer service or perhaps just doesn't care. She seemed irritable as I observed her dealing with other tables as weIl. I find it disappointing that the owner is ok with her treating customers so poorly. He obviously does not care about his restaurant or surviving in this competitive town, which is sad because I love supporting small businesses. I can honestly say I've never been so upset about restaurant service in my entire life. 
As for the food- overpriced. Especially the apps. Rice is usually mushy. You can get better elsewhere."
Negative	"Canned mushrooms on a pizza? Seriously?  Hello Potifino's....1980 called and wants their canned ingredients back.

We scraped the garbage toppings off the pizza only to find poor quality cheese, sauce (probably prepackaged as well) and tasteless dough. 

Was really hoping for better considering the wait line on a Saturday night. More proof that food sucks outside Charlotte. If this place was near competition it would go out of business quickly."
Negative	Food is okay but don't expect their services if you dine in. They are Korean and speak in Korean to gossip about customer unfortunately, I and my friend understand Korean cuz we are Korean and they didn't know!!! Very rude!!!
Negative	Had a reservation set up for Saturday at 10:00 and they called me at 9:55 after i was already heading up there to tell me they have no cars available.we will call you when one comes in.Waited till 12:00 to call them to find out about my rental and they said they were closed and I'm basically out of luck...Ended up having to drive my own vehicle because they waited till the last minute on telling me they have no cars...the 1800 number was a joke.Lady told me to reschedule my trip...At this point I told her to just slap me across the face through the phone...never will use this company after this experience...
Negative	Food cold and not bringing anymore out and they have the nerve to charge $13 for it. Will never go back very disappointing. Could of went to a lot of different places and have better food for this price.
Negative	I haven't been to this location in awhile and I was appalled at the state it is in! The bathroom looked like a truck stop. The floors and tables were filthy. Even the prep area was an unorganized disaster! I mentioned to the manager about the state of the restroom and he didn't even apologize, he only half-heartedly offered to take a look himself, as if I was pulling his leg or something!
Negative	"Honestly out of my boyfriends mouth ""babe you massage me better then that , it was definitely NOT worth $70 . They we're holding a conversation the whole time in there language about who knows what? ""HOW RUDE "" !! So not relaxing!!!!!! On top of that when we were all done and about to walk out the door they were ALL yelling about a ""tip"" THE nerve of them !! How unprofessional!!!! What a bummer for my first time couple massage!"
Negative	Do not stay here. It really blows. Room is small. I could hear the people next door talking and moving around. Parking is a mess and way over priced. Not to mention they charged me $250.00 extra for a deposit which you get back when you check out.
Negative	"Extremely slow service.  Took 20 mins to get chips n salsa.  I ordered a bowl of soup for an appetizer 35 mins later still don't have it.  Been here 50 mins...... Still no food

Maybe poorly managed
Maybe understaffed 
Maybe not coming back"
Negative	I come here all the time and I love the pitaya bowls but I'm reviewing their customer service. Every time I've visited this place, they're always super rude. No matter how nice I am they always seem to have an attitude and act like its gonna kill them if I add something to my bowl. I don't mind paying extra, either. The blonde girl with braces is especially super super rude and she doesn't even greet customers when she takes their order. Please get better employees. I can tell from reviews that this isn't just a problem with me. Also, I included a picture of a message I received from one of them probably after reading my review. Nice
Negative	This company was terrible!!!! I used them for my newborn pictures and the photographer was not experienced at all....she came to our house and took hours to set up finally when she was done she started with the poses the same ones she had done for my friend she was not creative at all I gave her some of the ideas we had and they turned out terrible she didn't know how to position the baby right and the pictures did not look like the quality  from the ones they show on website...after I placed my order and had only a few good ones to chose from they charged me $500 for only 3 collages that I got, and when I got them in the mail i noticed they used the same pictures over and over in one collage they didn't look nothing like what I chose and they were not edited either....I would never use them again.
Negative	We have eaten here for years. Over the past couple of years we have seen the quality of the food and the service deteriorate. The chairs are filthy. The menus old, dirty and damaged. Prices have always been great, but we may have to look for a new Thai restaurant as the staff, chef and management seem to have lost their passion. The owners need to CLEAN the place and replace the chairs and menus. The servers need uniforms and worst of all, the food quality has suffered and rarely does a full table of food come out at the same time. We really have enjoyed Thai Noodle 2, but if they don't improve the dining experience, we will not return.
Negative	I paid to have my headlights cleaned and I am a monthly member.   It was the worst wash yet. After i was just told it would be the best wash I could get. They left the inside of my car a mess and did a horrible job washing it. It had streaks all over it.   Don't go here. I am going to discontonue my member ship.
Negative	I requested a refund on my good-faith deposit of $500 - over 20 days and numerous emails  later I am still waiting for my refund.  I am relieved that I did not move into one of their properties and would think twice if I were you.  Policies seem to be in their favor with little to NO care for the families they impact.  #ThinkTwice and keep looking...
Negative	"My husband and I recently spent the weekend at Bellagio, Las Vegas. I accidentally left a silk dress and called in  a few hours after we checked out. 
Bellagio promised to let us know on the following day which they did not. We also left 2 reports on this . When we called in 2 days later, Bellagio said there was none. The dress somehow disappeared from the closet.
Is this a 5* hotel? 
If I can leave a zero star rating, I would, based on the lack of honesty as well as professionalism. 
Newport Beach, CA."
Negative	It's been a week now and I had some time to think about our experience we had here on New Years Eve. We made reservations for dinner about a week in advance for New Years Eve when we arrived for dinner the hostess looked confused we were there but she found our names for dinner. Shortly there after the manager came out and apologized to us but they made a mistake and could not seat us for dinner. They had a private party for that night. So my only experience was not good since every place in town was booked being New Years. So thanks for ruining our evening
Negative	"Ambiance: the outside actually looks quite authentic, but among entering, you basically have an awkward blend of Westernized Asian. The place was very empty.

Service: the lady kept rushing us but was very friendly. She answered our questions. In general, it wasn't bad. she filled our water very promptly, the towels were very good!

Food: TERRIBLE. I will say I have very high requirements for sushi since I lived in japan for a while, but go to Tamari if you want fresh sushi. The tuna was dry, the sea urchin was down right disgusting. The prices are extremely extensive for the quality they offer. The rolls weren't bad, but that's mainly due to the sauces, and not the ingredients themselves. I would rank even cheap places like oishi bento or campus sushi places higher than this. Their tonkatsu was also VERY DRY. Expensive, low quality. NOT GOOD. I should've known from the start with the cliche ginger dressing salad and the artificial miso soup that this place wouldn't be good."
Negative	"Our experience at Hooters today was less than mediocre. We waited 25 minutes before a server came over to tell us ""it will be a few more minutes"" we had to go over to a random table and ask them to use their menus because we never got any. After 30 mins we got our drinks and then after another 30 mins we got our food. Well not all of us. There were 7 girls at our table and only 5 ordered food- wings and onion rings (doesn't take long in the deep fryer). We were missing a platter and a plate of onion rings- which came another 30 mins later. At this point we asked to see a manager- who honestly did not care at all that we were waiting for this long and that we were basically ignored the whole night. The manager said ""sorry she's kinda new - we can take the platter off the bill and can I make anything else faster for you?"" Well no - that was the last of food and drinks and we had 3 servers at the table how were they all new? he just said ""ok"". 
We were a table full of servers so we get it's busy sometimes 
 BUT WORST SERVICE EVER. Not even great ""hooters"" could have fixed this experience. 0.5 star."
Negative	This was not a good experience. You know when you walk in a place and get a bad vibe. That was ours. We should have just left but we were starving and really wanted a good bowl of pho. It was cold outside and very windy. First of all everything looked dirty. The person who we think was the owner was there and he was sitting in a booth. He was sick and coughing and sneezing all over everything.  No kleenex. .... on the table and into the air. The pho came out and it had a weird fowl flavor. It was not clear like every other pho I have had. It was cloudy...eeewwww. The eye of round did not taste fresh. The bean sprouts and basil were limp and browning. Then the owner decided to open the doors. I told you it was windy outside. Everything  blew off our table. The cold air was Bone chilling and made the soup get cold very fast. My hair was blowing all over the place. We could not get out if here fast enough. I am happy to say that we didn't get food poisoning but that's about all good I can say for this place. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Viet Noodle Bar on Spring Mountain. It is in Chinatown but it is worth the drive.
Negative	I would have given a zero if I could. This place does not even deserved a star. I am in need for a vehicle to replace the one that got totaled. Walked into the dealership at around 8pm, I know it's 1 hour till close so sales maybe little grumpy. At the door, the salesman asked, do you need help? I was like, you serious? I am at a dealership, of cause I am looking for a car. So I told him, oh I am just looking for some cars. Then he didn't say a word, and back down looking at his phone, did not say his name, did not offer to answer questions that I may have. Definitely not recommend
Negative	Being in Vegas for 3 years, I learned that most of the Chinese restaurants here taste basically the same and is very mediocre to disappointing. I work very near this place and gave it a try for lunch. I judge how good a Chinese restaurant is by the quality of their fried rice. I ordered the combination fried rice and I have to honestly say it is the absolute worst I ever had. I can cook better than this on my worst day! Never ever coming back here to try anything else! I'm so upset I wasted my time and money!
Negative	"It wasn't super terrible, it really wasn't, but I probably wouldn't return.  

I've had much better fish and chips elsewhere for $6-7.  I'd rather eat the fish and chips or fish sandwich at Jack-in-the-Box or Burger King.  

Everything here was super salty and the fountain drinks were limited to diet-this and diet-that.  Yuck.

My meal was edible but it took a lot of strength to actually keep it down."
Negative	"The ownership changed, but we kept going. Last time, one of servers was so friendly and nice. He was great, but tonight was very disappointing. This was very obvious favoritism or racism, I should say, experience that I ever felt.
We( Asian woman and Black guy)walked in, and they welcomed and seated us. Then a white man walked in and they welcomed and seated him. They didn't even ask what kind of drinks we wanted, but one of the servers asked  the white man who came later. And a couple of minutes later, a white woman walked in. And seconds later a waitress took the drinks to the table for the white man and to another table for a white woman. Finally she came to us and ask  what we wanted to drink. Really? We closed our menus and we were sitting obviously that we were ready to order. They didn't even acknowledge us at all! So I told my boyfriend, ""Let's go"" 
I had to let them know why we were leaving.  So I  asked for a manager. Of course he or she wasn't there. So I told one of servers that we were here first and you guys were serving them who came later after us. All she said was ""sorry"" trying to give me a hug. If you were trying to hug me because I am your sister, you should have served us fairly.

It really made me sad and disappointed."
Negative	This is my second visit to Hakkasan, I decided to blame Spring break on my first visit. The nightclub is horrible... horrible... horrible... They pack sooo many people into the club that people are literally jumping on top of one another! You cant move on the dance floor and you have to fight to leave the club. I can withstand someone stepping on my foot, I can withstand people splashing a drink or bumping into me... I cannot withstand nonstop barrage of people pushing you and the inability to move. Save your time, go to the their other nightclub Omnia!
Negative	Not as good as Tasty-Yo! Plus, it's more expensive, more of a scene, and you have to deal with lots of crying kids and smooching couples while waiting in the line that goes out the door. Definitely overrated... Try Tasty-Yo instead for better flavor, fresher fruit, and a more pleasant overall experience!
Negative	Waited over 15 minutes to get our order. Was promised fresh hot fries. Got home and they were the exact opposite of fresh! horribly stale I fed them to my dog. I won't be going back.
Negative	"I don't know what they we're thinking with this Pink's. Most if not all the dogs offered in Hollywood have been replaced or renamed for Vegas. I was so confused. 

Either way, I went with the desert named one, Sonora or what have you. It came loaded in a fry dolly. Bun, dog, grilled onions, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. I think I got it all, honestly j could have forgot something. There was so much junk on it that I couldn't pick it up and ha to cradle it with the fry holder. 

It was a huge mess that didn't taste amazing but got the job done. I was hungover as usual and this was a good fix. Throw a cold beer in, and I was good to go. 

I won't return, it's a tourist spot that doesn't need to be there. Pack up shop and move to Hollywood where you could alleviate the long lines at the flagship joint."
Negative	"Was walking by yesterday to eat lunch (elsewhere), and was thinking to myself, told ya so!!
Roaches and gross hygiene!  Here's links to the health department advisory, and notice they gave them SIX inspections before the consumer advisory.."
Negative	"Went there on Sunday evening for my Dad's birthday party.  First of all there is a $1.50 per person ""cake cutting fee"" to be able to bring in the cake for his birthday which I think is ridiculous with a ten person party that they know they will make money on.  And it's a birthday, not like we are just bringing our own dessert for the heck of it.  We decided not to do it.

We order probably $200 worth of food and drinks and asked if we could have 3 rolls to come with our dinner.  No big deal right?  WRONG!  Our server came back and says they have 5 left for someone that may come in for a sandwich and will not accommodate us with any rolls and did not offer for us to purchase a couple.  Basically, you get what you get and you don't get upset.

Food was nothing more than okay especially after them not making any reasonable accommodations for us.

So 10 people and a $200 bill absolutely not worth the trip.  Try Two Brothers BBQ in the South Hills."
Negative	"If you like cupcakes with zero taste, but tons of frosting AND being treated like you're not good enough to be there, then this is the place for you.
My husband and I went there today, and we probably won't go again. First off, their selection of flavors is pretty small, especially compared to LuLu's, down on McDowell. When I asked what the ""Momo"" flavor was, she rattled off something quickly, and then said, ""Look up on the board. All of our flavors are listed there."" I'm pregnant and I thought I might have been having an irrational moment, because I thought that was rude. As soon as we walked outside, my normally uber calm husband says, ""If you don't want to explain to someone one flavor of your cupcakes, maybe you shouldn't have a cupcake shop. That girl was a batch."" (spelled correctly). I couldn't agree more. 
And my cupcake was lame, to boot. The 4lbs of icing were just okay, and the cake part was super bland. For $3.50, I expect a lot more flavor and a lot less attitude. Disappointing."
Negative	"I used to live in Orange County where Lee's first started to populate.  This Lee's sandwich is over priced (Most likely because it's Vegas).  It looks like kids are running this place.  They don't know how to offer service.  Lines are unorganized; can't tell who is up.  Pick-up is a mess as well.  Their sandwiches are the same as the other Lee's.  Must eat right away otherwise the baguette will harden.  Usually get the Special and it's average; bread wasn't warm at all.  Coffee was over price; should have went to Starbucks for that price.  Parking is a pain in this are with Hot n Juicy a few stores over.  

Not worth the time or money."
Negative	"I have been going to Dutch Bros for years now and I have never had a bad experience until tonight. We went to the location on McQueen and Guadalupe and as we were waiting in line the girl at the drive thru window began petting the dog in the car in front of us. She let the dog lick all over her hands and continued to pet him for a good five to ten minutes. I asked one of the other workers if the girl was going to wash her hands and she promised me she would. Needless to say she did not. Then to prove a point my boyfriend asked the same girl who just pet the dog that was in front of us if she could throw a cup away for him from another restaurant and she told him she couldn't because it ""was against health code policies."" Since when did letting a dog lick all over your hands and then not washing them before you serve drinks become okay. Not to mention the straws are unwrapped so your filthy hands touch the straw I'm expected to drink from. I'm disgusted and disappointed. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a huge supporter of this establishment but this was unacceptable."
Negative	"Woah. So disappointed.
Food delivered after an extremely long wait, cold as ice, so when I mentioned this to waitress (not our usual one), she snatched my plate without a word (i.e. Oh, I'm sorry. Let me heat that up for you.). After a while she returned my plate and it was slightly warmer. Got to the fish taco and it contained one tiny piece of fish about the size of two golf pencils side by side. Wasn't very good, like the old days (last year)."
Negative	Came here for a special occasion- completely disappointed. Ordered the chicken, steak and fish- all tasted dry and old. My girlfriend had the vegetarian options and they were burnt. The bill came out to 100. Would skip out on this joint.
Negative	I was there last Friday night.  Stacy if you see this, contact me and I will give you some needed feedback.  I see where some last few reviews were good, but my meal was pretty bad on Friday.  I spoke with at least 4 other people who were at your property this past weekend and everyone said they would not eat at your Noodle House again -- they all said the food was bad since you changed chefs.  In addition to bad tasting food, your F&B QC is really going downhill fast.  I can give you examples if you want to really hear them.
Negative	It's OK, the service is typical of any Chinese buffet and the food quality is OK.  It is better than the Chinese buffet down the road in Oregon so I guess they have that going for them.
Negative	"We had seen the storefront, then checked them out on here.  Wow, they had 4 1/2 stars!  So, we decided to order for our football watching pleasure.

The pizza was not good.  It is sooo heavy!!  I can still feel the one slice I ate sitting in my stomach...almost 10 hours ago.  The crust/dough had no flavor, the cheese was incredibly greasy (not in a good way) and each small slice felt like it weighed 5 lbs.  Not enjoyable at all.  Let me put it this way, there is almost an entire pizza still sitting in our fridge (probably going to be thrown away), and if you knew my hubby, that never happens.  There's usually barely a slice for me to enjoy the next day.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars...the BBQ wings were very good and the ranch was good.

Very disappointed, because we were really expecting a lot better."
Negative	"So, 14-15 months later.......First the grass died at the south end of the building.  When we told the Res Mgr about it he had no idea.  I still haven't figured out what the new guy does.  The mystery continues.

Also, the dues were raised (no issue with that), but our auto draft didn't get changed and they keep wanting to charge a late fee of $15.00 for the two months and I refuse to pay it.  I send them letters telling them I am not paying and they keep mailing the same amount due.  I guess I will try hitting up a board meeting to see if I can get an edict from them."
Negative	Kevin did my nails and I totally adored them but it seemed like he rushed and left a lot of bubbles in my nails. I paid $44 for a mani pedi and my nails are for prom like cmon now. My nails should be spotless.
Negative	"Blecch!  This would have been mediocre food at half the price.  But if you're feelin' good about shelling out $15-$20 for humdrum corned beef hash or a tasteless omelet, this is the place for you!  And adding tasteless lobster to that omelet still doesn't justify the price -- I can make a plain mushroom and chives omelet taste better than what they serve here.  Also, the butter that they use to fry the hash browns didn't smell quite right, and I couldn't dodge the smell no matter how much I shifted my head around.

They also seem understaffed.  So the service, while friendly, is really slow.

You're better off hopping onto a cab and getting burgers at the In N Out."
Negative	The food here is gross. We ordered nachos, which were mostly crushed round chips with some sprinkle cheese and a jalapeño or two on top. Then I got a shrimp po' boy. It was a long roll with a few Sam's club frozen popcorn shrimp and some lettuce, no sauce, dry as a bone. I ate a few of the shrimps and pitched the rest. Even as far as bar food goes, this place sucks. And it took almost 40 minutes for them to make it.
Negative	I wish i could rate them worse. I just moved after 3 almost 4 years, First off they are on their third manger for the property. So that give you a hint about management and structure. 2nd Parking even though spots are marked is always a issue. 3rd the place is not kept up like it should be for the price in this area of Vegas. I mean your neighbors are a trailer park and meth heads. 4th security is not as posted, they are monitors. I have had problems that they would not get involved in. 5th Dogs shit everywhere and it not cleaned up. Oh my worst is the building is like a brick oven in the summer it does not dissipate heat.
Negative	Not sure what happened to this place, loved it until almost 2 years ago, then the quality seemed to drop off enough to make it not worth it.I gave it 3 more chances in case it was a fluke, but it wasn't.
Negative	"Came here for an ESP. Dealt with Jerry. Got my bike inspected and they said there was too much oil in my bike. I changed it myself including filter. I asked how much does the bike use. They said 3.5 qt. I used 3. They said there was too much oil when they checked the filter. Prob wanted me to get an oil change by then. It didn't make sense, but I'm not going to argue over this. Another part of the rejection was the clutch needed to be adjusted. Understandable. Next was my tires (still had some life) needed to be changed. I don't understand why that would effect it since I'll be replacing it on my own dime (not covered). Another thing is the bike had a wobble over 80 mph. I thought it was normal lol. Paid $126 for the inspection. Asked if I would be charged again the second time once I got
Things fixed elsewhere and they said yes unless I got the work done here. 2 stars because Gavin was really responsive and got me going quick."
Negative	"We all own cars and from time to time they need maintained and/or repaired. Sadly this is NOT the repair shop it once was. I recently contracted with this store to install rear struts on my Hyundai. Not a difficult job for a qualified mechanic. Well, I just had to replace one of the struts they installed because the mechanic stripped out the main shaft threads allowing the strut to rattle nonstop and somewhere allow the process snapped a bolt on the mount and tried to torch it out, unsuccessfully. Now, I've had to replace the new strut they assed up AND have to make another appointment with a different auto repair shop to fix their fuck up. Do not go here if you need anything more than an oil change or tires. I actually expect BOTH State Rd Monro's to close within the next year due to problems like this. 

Update- I played tag with Monro customer service since THEY reached out to me. Nothing has been resolved. Here is my email again so you can send me yours Brittany @ Monro. Feel free to send me an email and I'll send you a copy of the other repair shop invoice to fix Monro's mistake. 
jim@akron.usa.com
Don't call me before 4 pm. I am teacher and can't waste time trying to help you feel good about trying to help me. Either call after 4 or email me. Wasting my time isn't helping Monro's case."
Negative	"I must preface this with the fact that I eat at chipotle quite frequently. However, after today I don't think I will be eating there any time soon. I went on lunch break to get my husband and I a quick bite to eat. 

I ordered a burrito with chicken for my husband and a burrito bowl with chicken for myself. It was the lunch rush hour and the chicken was empty, so I agreed to wait a few min for some more to come out. I patiently waited about 3-5 min and finally the chicken came out they finished our meals with the toppings and I was out the door. At home I opened my bowl and much to my DISMAY the chicken was RAW in the middle like not just kind of pink, TOTALLY PINK. I ran to my husband to have him check his burrito before eating and it was also RAW. I couldn't believe it so I called the branch immediately and asked to speak to a manager. The girl on the phone informed me that due to the rush hour I couldn't speak to one. I explained to her that my food had raw chicken in it and she offered for us to come back for a free replacement. 

I quickly said absolutely NOT! I watched them throw the chicken from the grill onto a used cutting board with a used knife that cuts all the cooked chicken, they MUST know that if there was just ONE breast of raw chicken that was cut with those instruments, that means that the whole process and kitchen area has been contaminated. 

In conclusion I will NOT be returning to that Chipotle."
Negative	My family had tried the Lotus of Siam at their old location. The foods was good but not great. There are other Thai restaurants in town are much better then theirs and the prices was also cheaper then theirs. I happen to be in the area of their new location so I stopped by for lunch. The restaurant was busy and the girl greeted me asked if it was Okay for me to have lunch at the bar which I agreed. I had to wait for 10 minutes before the bartender acknowledged me. I placed my lunch order and it took them more then 20 minutes to bring me my food and the food was cold. I wouldn't go back there again. I
Negative	"Do not go to this place if you intend on using a groupon, they will no honor it. They basically told me that it's not accepted on their daily specials even though nothing on the groupon's fine print that says so. Very deceitful business practice not to mention lousy customer service. 
Sushi was bland and unappetizing and my steak was under cooked with raw pieces."
Negative	The food here isn't good. Your better off going to chipotle. The girl working here needs to smile. They are stingy with the toppings. I thought it would be a nice health alternative than fast food, but I was wrong. Their salads are loaded with carbs and it's super expensive. I wouldn't mind paying for it if it was tasty. Although they do have a nice seating area though. Definitely will not be returning.
Negative	"Used to love this place

Just went in for buy 1 get 1 apps. Was happy to buy a drink but was told I HAD to buy liquor. Asked to buy any other drink but booze and told no.

I need to pick up my kid from daycare in like 30 mins.

So I left.

Not sure if just me, but never had the ""only liquor"" rule before"
Negative	"Yes they're tasty but if they rip up your gut, they shouldn't be advertised as edible because they are not. 
These are indigestible. 
They should not be sold as food. 
My belly still hurts and it's been several hours since I ate three (3!) dinner mint-sized chocolates after a dinner I eat often with no problem. That's less than an ounce and a half! And my belly kept me up all night!  

I was lured by the special offer to pay only shipping as risk free. It's not. They will not refund shipping and handling. You are spending money on a product that's so bad don't even want the majority of individually wrapped, uneaten portions, back. 
That should tell you all you need to know about them.
Do not buy these. 
There's much better chocolate out there."
Negative	08/02/2017 United Nissan el día de hoy me robó $300. Después de haberme firmado un papel de que en caso de no quedarme con el carro al siguiente día no había problemas, resulta ser que me mintieron y nunca resolví mis $300 para atrás, esto fue (JESUS) se parece a Matute los cubanos saben de quién hablo y el manager de ventas, me sacaron del dealer por reclamar mi dinero y me quitaron todas mis copias para no tener pruebas.
Negative	"My family and a friend met up at Maggiano's in Fashion Show and I'm experiencing mixed feelings about it. 

Locations: Great place to meet but mall closes before the restaurant. It makes the underground parking difficult to access. Consider using the valet. 

Service: Our server was very nice but she also presented the olive oil/balsamic vinegar plate in front of my four year old. It was a very messy spill. 

Food: Pretty good overall. The fried zucchini appetizer is always good. My friends chicken salad looked fine and my pepperoni flat bread was not interesting in the slightest. 

Summary: I'll go back if encouraged but great Italian food is easy to come by in Las Vegas. I'm not rushing back."
Negative	This airline is super dirty! On my flight to Vegas, I saw a chewing gum right next to my seat, and then I saw nuts on the carpet on my flight back to LA....don't they clean it?
Negative	"Quick summary. They charge you to remove food, charge you to breath, and charge to you  live.

The food is okay but boy do they love to charge you for anything and everything. If you want to remove beans from your burrito, they'll charge you an extra dollar. How does that make sense? They dont even tell you the extra charges.  The $6 burrito only has meat and beans, if you dont want a dry ass burrito youll pay $3 more. They should atleast let us know. With tacos they'll ask you if you want it with everything and if you say yes, they'll almost double the price of the taco which is already almost 4 bucks a piece. So if you want tacos with more than just meat and a tortilla be prepared chuck your wallet at the cashier. After we looked at our receipts all we saw was extra charges eveerywhere. I understand if you want guac or something it's always extra every restaurant you go, but they actually tell you about it. But seriously they charged us to remove a food item from our burrito, they didn't mention it or even tell us why. If they atleast say ""hey this stuff im adding to you order is more $, is that ok?"" We wouldn't be so upset. So all in all we paid almost $45-$50 for 3 waters, two tacos, a small burrito, small torta, and half assed nachos. If want better tasting food walk across to Tacos El Gordo, great staff bomb food."
Negative	"The food is usually very good. The hostesses lately have been very rude and our last visit may have been enough to not return. We had a pair of exchanges while waiting for a table that had our party discussing leaving after 26 minutes (when we were ""quoted 30-40 minutes"") and after 45 minutes (when the hostesses refused to answer how long into the wait we were).

After being seated our server flatly refused to put an order in of cheese on top of bread, which included us asking if they could just take cheese and put it on the bread before they warm the bread and her saying, ""we don't have cheese.""  Other sparkles of the attentive service received are the expeditor trying to hand a hot plate to a toddler, getting our order wrong and failing with refills. 

While the service is not typically this bad the rudeness from the hostesses is typical.

Such a shame because the food is usually so good."
Negative	Our car overheated on the freeway and we brought it in to My Auto.  They said it was a bad Head Gasket, and the vehicle only had 40,000 miles on it, so that seemed strange to me.  They wanted to charge me $1,600 for a new head gasket...I took it to a different auto mechanic near by and they said it was NOT the Head Gasket, but the water pump that cost me 400.00.  They said that even if it was the Head Gasket, it would have cost me $700.00 (max.), but they said it was just fine and that the water pump went out.  I was discouraged and brought my car to the second auto shop.  They fixed it for under 400.00 and it has been running great ever since.  I have not, and will not not go back to My Auto.  I do not appreciate being taken advantage of, especially by auto mechanics.  Please be careful, and if it seems like too much get a second opinion.  Good Luck.
Negative	This is the saddest buffet I've ever been to in my entire life. It was awful. The quality was sub-par at best, and disgusting at worst. Various sauces had a thick, congealed layer on them, shrimp were covered in a gooey mess and everything felt dirty. A party of 7 came with me before we went bowling for my birthday and it was just a whomp-whomp sort of meal. I have no desire to go back.
Negative	Soo 3 weeks ago I ate here and u have one word for this place that will be Disguest is a good word for this restaurant food was horrible tasty like a newly born baby puke on my green beans the hush puppies are like turd overall only because they comp us some of our food they get 2 stars never eating here again
Negative	Leonard's carries women's shoe sizes up to a 14 or 15--but you better have a E-width or wider shoe to buy there. And there are two basic styles--grandma's shoes or cross dresser shoes. Being the only shoe store in town to carry a decent selection for those with a shoe size greater than 10, it's a shame that they only cater to those with double-wide feet. They've also moved locations over by the Hard Rock Hotel and now carry a selection of clothing that would make someone's grandma proud, but not mine.
Negative	So so....free bread basket was ok...service was terrible..out waitress had her parents there I think , Sunday March 4th around 8p ish....cuz we kept looking around to get a wine and she was conversatiing we noticed. And her table in front of us was waving her down as she kept conversatiing, won't be going back, I tried the meatballs it was good and I had to wave our waitress down to get parmesan cheese, if I would have paid for dinner she would have got nothing for a tip, luckily I didn't phew !!! Joe's stone crab and Al Mulino at ceasars palace go there,  Amazing service and AMAZING food
Negative	Omg omg where to begin...I decided to try this place based on a friend, her hair turned out amazing so I wanted mine to be just as amazing. Mind you when I say amazing im referring to she had no hair and now it is down her back. She always always always talked about how her stylist was so awesome and treated her so well and I craved this treatment too. I'm very punctual or at least I try to be anyway. If I am late its no more than 5 or 10 mins. Anywho im getting off topic. So I go and im sitting there and waiting and waiting and waiting but I will say that after she was done my hair felt amazing, it might have had something to do with Sonya the shampoo girl, I think I love her lol and if I could take her with me I prob would have due to the amazing shampoo job she did. But back to the topic on hand. I wouldn't suggest this location just based on the service and this is just based on the girl I had. I wish I could remember her name but I was so mad I wish I would have wrote it down.  So after 40 minutes of me sitting there staring at her while she has a conversation with another girl im boiling but like I said after she was done I calmed down lol and I did try her again because I loved her so much but same shit happened. This for me is a HUGE no no like don't treat me like im not a reliable customer that won't come back when I would've been if she actually tried. If u have time to sit in a shop for hours after your appointment time then have at it but my time is important so im gonna pass on this location and for what u pay it is TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. you forking over tons of money to look good but have your time wasted. I THINK NOT
Negative	"This place is the worst. I think it must be a front for some other ""business"" because they couldn't care less about their customers or customer service.  My husband really wanted a specific car he had scene on Autotrader and they wouldn't even let him test drive it until he made a down payment! The car was in the middle of their showroom blocked in by lots of other cars. I guess to lazy to do the work of moving all the cars.

My husband ended up buying the car. He had to wait a few days to pick it up because it was supposed to get a tune up as he noticed a few things that were off when they finally did let him test drive it.When he picked up the car someone said they would go get it for him and so he waited at the front of the shop for 45 MINUTES, he then went to ask when the 20k car he had just purchased was and they were like ""oh right'. Over the course of the next week we realized that not one thing they said they would fix was actually fixed. There wasn't even a wiper blade on the back windshield!! The list is long of the things wrong with the car but the main one was the brakes. They made an awful grinding noise and didn't work as well as they should. kind of important, brakes that work. Call me crazy.

We had 36 days to return the car and have repairs done if there were things that were off, so we made an appointment and went back with the car. The mechanic took it for a test drive and of course came back saying the brakes were fine as they still fell within safety standards, if even just by a hair. This is at which point we made a scene inside the dealership about the horrible service and the shady business practice. The manager then came over and said fine they will fix the brake pads at not cost. We only had to make a scene to get this done. Another main issue was the drivers side seat heater didn't work, this of course was never looked at or acknowledge and still doesn't work.

Bottom line is this place REALLY sucks and we would never go back."
Negative	Le pain naan était dur et brûlé, le riz me semblais très banal. J'ai pris une entrée avec les trois choix (les ognons bhaji étaient très bons) Je suggère de prendre un lassi à la mangue. Je donne 2 étoiles sur 5 mais je ne crois pas que mon choix représente vraiment le Taj; j'ai pris que des plats végétariens.
Negative	"I've used Overnight Prints for over a year to have postcards made for our exhibitions program. They just ruined three cards with terrible trimming. They refuse to offer a refund and sent me their crap ""defective print"" policy. Don't use them, as the quality control sucks and they don't stand behind their product."
Negative	Id give it NO stars if i could...Food was awful. Pizza was soggy and flavor was uninspired and flat. The wings were the worst wings I've EVER had...overcooked, and tasted old, threw them away after eating one. I never throw away food. Buyer beware!!!!
Negative	"I wish I checked the reviews before I rented. They just started to get bad after 2015 . 

ZERO stars Walk Away do not go here. Total rip offs. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
I prepaid because I thought it said the process would be faster but of coarse it was not took 2hours. On top of that she charged us for the 19.99 a day insurance I told her we do not need being that we have insurance. She made up this elaborate story that vegas is a no fault state & we had to pay for their insurance. My sister just went to vegas in May  & rented a car and did not pay for extra insurance at another rental Company. Because I prepaid I stayed there & rented the damn car otherwise I would have walked out once I saw the long ass line. And I was charged for the extra insurance she lied. Their ethics are bad. Walk away"
Negative	"Didn't mind the high price! Dropped my vehicle off a week ago and am still waiting. Every time I call it's 30 more minutes.
 Will not be going back for any service. Even though I was referred by a friend of the owner, I never let them know that. 
 Your experience will be like this! You walk in and they may be talking amongst themselves to figure out who is gonna help you. After a few minutes they'll ask what you need. If your lucky and it's a minor issue (check the air in my tire) you'll be out the door in no time. Anything else good luck and be prepared to rent a vehicle for a few days to a few weeks!!!!"
Negative	"Maybe because I was assigned a bad tech but I'll give 0 stars if possible.

I had an A/C problem and I had to go through my home warranty company, schedule a service call, the tech showed up early. He spent a few minutes checking the A/C unit, check for freon charge and was determined it was low. He diagnosed a leak in the evaporator which is located in the attic and I was also told that I needed a new AC unit that will cost me about $9700. The problem was he didn't actually go to the attic and check the evaporator for leaks.I knew this info from the 2nd AC company that I scheduled to do another diagnosis and to get a 2nd opinion. The 2nd AC company is in the business for 45yrs (too bad they're not in the home warranty list to call for service) 


The 2nd company did the actual leak test and found no problem. They used a freon probe that will detect if there's a leak within the unit or the copper line and found none. They also performed a bubble leak test of all the brass fittings and found none. The 2nd AC company also noted that in order for the Mojave tech to determine the leak was coming from the evaporator that evaporator cover needs to be removed and visually check the coils, use a probe to detect freon, and inspect for corrosion which in our case was never done. The tech only grabs a ladder, peaked his head and used a flashlight and BOOM the diagnosis was a leak from the evaporator.


All I needed was a freon charge. This company was charging $120/lb but the 2nd company only charged me $80/lb. Just beware!"
Negative	"Two different cars. Two different experiences. Came in with my girlfriends Honda. It was 9:55, I was told they couldn't help me until 10am. Then was ignored by 3 different people. Next day came in my S550 at 9:45. Had the door opened for me (not the door to the building, the door to my car). Was helped instantly. You guys shouldn't judge books by covers. For a company that prides themselves on not being a ""dealership"", it certainly feels like it."
Negative	The clinic is clean and the equipment looks fine, However I paid for one year hair laser removal and the technician who started the treatment, was very friendly and helpful and tried to do her best, the 2nd session there was another technician and she refused to provide me with the treatment on same area I had in the first session and said the first technician was fired because she had given wrong information, which is not my fault as a client. I got those information and trusted this clinic and paid and then they change their commitment which is totally unaccepted and unprofessional. when I told the receptionist about my dissatisfaction, she kept herself busy with phone and didn't answer me.  now I am looking for another clinic to cover the area they refuse to treat.
Negative	I have been taking my dog to this boarding facility for years. I'm particularly attracted to the large grassy area for him to run. However, the last two stays have been less than impressive. The first resulted in less than personable staff during both reservation and departure. My dog couldn't get out of there fast enough, which seemed odd. I wanted to give this facility another try though because I'm rather picky about where I will take my dog. Sadly, the second stay was worse than the first as my dog split his tail on their kennels (confirmed by the vet) - something he's never done before! What upset me the most was even though there was dried blood on his tail the staff failed to bring this to my attention. So, when his tail started bleeding all over my home again it came as quite a shock! While I was assured there hasn't been a change in management lately, their services indicate otherwise. The only saving grace for two stars is the lovely older woman who has worked here for years - she shows genuine love and concern for the well-being of your pet. Please go back to your old pleasant ways, Applewood!
Negative	So came in here to see about starting to buy my foundation here because my current target brand kept drying out my face and looking blotchy. I walked into their very busy store and said I was in search of a good foundation and wanted to get color matched. They wrote my name on a list. After 40 minutes I decided to start looking on my own. Not one person in this store of many workers even asked me if I needed any help. And I needed plenty. I ended up trying a Clinique and some Sephora concealer. As far as the color we will see how it goes . Hopefully it works out ok. After not only waiting forever in the store to not get matched. Then the line was forever long and their MPOS or mobile register person starts pulling the person behind us in line . From the back ? So instead of pulling people that have been waiting forever , you pull someone who just got in line . Makes no sense . Worst customer service ever and even though I really wanted to get good quality product and wanted someone to help me pick all the right products I needed, because of the horrible service from start to finish I'll just stick with the same service and cheaper prices at target .
Negative	"I don't recommend this dealer for anything. I have a 2007 vw Passat one day it stopped working because of the fuel controle module. Luckily the week after I got a recall letter over that exact thing. I took the car right away in a tow truck on a Friday, they said they had to order the part and the car would be finished on a Wednesday. The car lasted there a whole month and didn't receive no call so I went and they told me ""oh yeah your car is done but it still don't run"". I went to go check we're the car was at it was exactly at the same spot we're I had left it and it still has the check engine on over the same thing . So my guess is they didn't even bother to fix it. I really don't recommend this dealer."
Negative	"I was a fairly long-term customer. Used them for maybe 2 years.

A few notes on my experience:

1 - In the beginning, they were fairly accommodating with my last-minute schedule.
2 - $20/hour is a good rate


Two of my last experiences with them were as follows, which is why I am no longer a customer:

1 - I booked an appointment, the time came the next day, no one showed up. After some back-and-forth with Anna, it was revealed that the cleaner had some emergency and did not give any notice they wouldn't be coming.

2 - I booked an appointment on a Wednesday for a Friday. Explicitly confirmed on Weds that Fri is good. Called on Thursday to confirm, was told yes, we are on schedule. Friday came, no one showed up. After waiting 30-40 min, called to see what the problem is, was told there was a computer problem, and they did not schedule my appointment correctly.  When I expressed my frustration, I was told that I had to understand that they had a computer problem."
Negative	So the food was good. Not like what everyone else was saying about the beef being hard as a rock... seriously guys?! Everything was clean, employees nice enough however I almost tossed my ish when I saw the kid working on the line hand a patron the bathroom key and then go back to making a platter without changing his gloves. For real?!? I get being young and working, good for you dude, but holy hell...
Negative	Horrible horrible customer service! They have one person working early morning and she moves slower than a snail! She hates her job and it shows! She talks down to people she trains.. Starbucks is known for their great customer service and she doesn't have what it takes!
Negative	I went on a busy day. The aisles are too small. The bakery was extremely small for it being a schnucks. I did like their selection of yogurts. Everyone was over there when I was trying to look for some yogurt. Prices are a bit high to my dismay, but their parking lot is always full.
Negative	"Beware of series attempts to upcharge. Dude tried to talk me in to an $80 car wash to ""scrub my seats"". My car is fairly clean all the time and does not need that deep of cleaning, nice try. 

I still feel like the prices are ridiculous for a car wash. I paid $25 and they barely wiped down the dash and the inside of the windows were still dirty. Very disappointing. They do have a nice waiting area and good snacks. I'm just not sure I got what I paid for..."
Negative	"Food is good. Over priced!!! Not worth. 
Service: VERY BAD. We went with our family including a baby. While paying the bill in middle of the lunch buffet, the owner adviced us not to take more food and waste them. He asked us to restrict to whatever can be only consumed. In fact, we had some gravy leftovers which could not be taken. This was really dissappointing and hurting. 
VERY INDESCENT behaviour to customers in a buffet. I spoke to the owner in person and informed him that there was no food which was just wasted without even being tasted and asked him if he was specific in any item being wasted. 
His response was that ""Next Time I will take a Photo and show you"". This was the most filthy answer you can get out of a guy owning a restaurant. 
I would definitely stay away and keep my friends and fellow beings stay away from this restaurant!

The last thing, we had to step out to take care of our baby towards the end of the lunch. When I came back to check my dish at the table, the table was fully cleaned and was ready for the evening. My bags and my baby car seat was still hanging around in that table and the table looked very well that it was unfinished. 

Stay Away! I read the other comments just now.. Will not repeat getting in here.."
Negative	"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars, is because we had good service. Aside from that, it fell short. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and I'm pretty sure they forgot the vodka. My boyfriend said his chicken Caesar sandwich just tasted like mayo, and when he opened it, it looked like 4 oz of chicken on the entire sandwich. I got a mixture of two types of wings, which were actually pretty good- although not $14 good. $14 for buffalo wings seems a bit absurd! 
Here's the kicker. I turn to check out the bar and see the bartender doing her lipstick in the mirror in the bar. I think, ok kinda unprofessional. Then she starts touching up the sides of her mouth with her fingers. I think to myself eww, I couldn't believe she was touching her mouth while standing in front of guests. And finally, she turns around without washing her hands and proceeds to serve guests. Gross!!!
I would not recommend this restaurant."
Negative	Just came back from 5 days in Vegas. Went to Guy Fieri's for dinner our 2nd to last night. No one finished their dinner. Presentation was good if not over the top. Fries were delicious, nachos were good. Burgers were laden with so many things the bottom bun was soaked to the point where it fell apart. The worst part was the horrible gut wrenching bowel movements that followed it. Two people didn't even last til the check came and I, your courteous narrator, almost crapped my pants on fremont st. twice. The drenching sweats that came along with the cramping was the cherry on the sundae. If you eat here you better give yourself 30 - 45 minutes in your hotel room just in case...
Negative	My boyfriend and I decided to try out this restaurant because we love seafood. First let me say it is a really nice place.  The waiter was really nice and helpful. We started with the crab, spinach and artichoke dip. It was ok. I ordered the walleye and some vegetables along with New England clam chowder and he had prawn linguine and lobster bisque. The clam chowder tasted like flour and the lobster bisque was thick and flavorless. The walleye simply tasted like fish without any seasoning whatsoever. Everything was just room temperature like it sat a while before being brought to us. We were not pleased with the lack of flavor of the food. One thing I can say is you will never know if you like a place until you try it. Well, we tried this place and can cross it off our list. This is just what we thought so you may want to try for yourself because you never know until you try for yourself. If you decide to try it I hope you enjoy it more than we did.
Negative	"Such a disappointment. $50 for 6 treats and the cupcake I could have bought at a grocery store and it would have tasted better. Cannoli was good, everything else was a bust. Dry and ""old"" tasting."
Negative	"Slooooooowwww!  Stopped in for lunch, maybie 4 tables with people.  Stood at door waiting to be seated while servers walked past at least 4 times.  Once finally seated waited and waited for service.  Finally ordered drinks and waited some more.  Got drinks and ordered sliders.  Waited 45 minutes, while other tables arrived, were served AND LEFT with no word or check in from the server.  Finally the sliders arrived, but not the tots we ordered.  Those came after we had nearly finished the sliders.

The sliders we're solidly just OK.  The best was the short rib, the ahi was also good, but the spicy chicken wasn't very spicy and was a majority breading.  My burger slider might have been good but it was cold.  The long awaited tots we're nothing special, just Ore Idas dropped in the fryer served with plain ketsup.

I like the concept overall, and the selection of wines and beers and flights is great.  I had the bubble flight which was great and hubs had a great beer flight.  Happy hour pricing is also very good.

Overall I will probably give it another shot, as the concept is good and HH prices and prices overall are appealing, except the extra charge for sauces, come on, really?"
Negative	"I am an online student. I was placed in a local intern placement where I was sexually harassed by the supervisor. ASU pulled me from the placement and expects me to repay to take the same course again when none of it was my fault ($500+ for a one credit course). Further, my husband also is an ASU student we are both majoring in the same area. They are continually up his butt for all different problems from 3 way phone conferences to placement phone calls and then they want him to register for more courses even though he can't budget it. After these last two internships he has one or two classes left. He had to give up his job to do a fulltime internship to finish his degree so I would say he and I have both been very dedicated to finishing our education. However, ASU is just about impossible to work with and there are days they are worse than bill collectors with riding him for more money, for more time, for more everything. They even dictated how we couldn't move because they'd need to know the address right away to get internship placements by June or July. They took until September finding him the internship location so that was false. It is just a nightmare. It is soul sucking and draining. The curriculum is graded to these rubrics so don't expect to input any creative input or say into your work. You recite what they want you to with quoted sources from books and websites they give you to work with only. There are so many students you never work with a teacher but instead with a ""grader"" you never get to know much about. I wouldn't recommend doing their online education program. At this point in time going local or moving to an area with a local education program would have been a better option. He is going to complete his additional certification for SPED at WSU after finishing the degree this Spring, if he finishes it. They have tried every roadblock they can."
Negative	I ordered the corned beef hash with fried rice. They messed up and gave steamed rice instead, so had to wait longer for my meal, so that held up my friends from eating. The corned beef was disgusting, it was all fried pieces of fat it seemed. Hardly any good meat from the corned beef hash. I feel gross and kind of nauseous from that meal. Girlfriend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, she says it was mediocre. Never had a good experience at any of the Bachi places. Won't return anymore, since I am always sickly after eating there. Fries are delicious, but those are easy to pull off on your owns
Negative	We were here on 8/11/2011, they would not let my friend in while wearing a sleeveless shirt. It's 105 degrees out here!! But a woman with a sleeves is okay? Really?? You suck, we drank somewhere else. By the way there were 10 of us and our tab at the last place was around 400.00, your loss Coyote Ugly.
Negative	"I was so excited to eat here!  I love the name, the ""Flower Child"" since I grew up in this era.  The restaurant is old school, retro, with shelves of vintage objects, industrial lighting, organic foods menu.  LOTS OF SEATING.

A picture of Twiggy is on the east wall, who was one of the 1966 fashion's,  first, super model, ever!  She was short  at 5'6"", weighed 112 pounds, but was influencing fashion, hair and makeup for generations to come.  

There is a ""peace sign"" painted over her face, which is strange and confusing,  because she was British and wasn't involved in any Viet Nam protests, like Joan Baez or Jane Fonda were.  So they should use one of their images instead, with a peace sign,  Fonda and Baez symbolized peace and protest, not Twiggy.  

In addition, a peace sign is a Missle,  encircled...a little history lesson, no extra charge.  

With that said, the food was JUST OK and very expensive.  Two wraps, a tiny plate of spinach, soup and a lemonade put me back $38!!!  Definitely not, ""1960 era prices!"" 

 We were honestly, still hungry, when we finished.. could have eaten, much more,  than I received at The Flower Child.  Bags of spinach cost 99 cents, field greens, 99 cents.  MY WRAP had some kind of turkey lunch meat in it...

Lose the tip jar, staff didn't do one thing to warrant a tip, no one came by to ask,"" how our food was"", no one got us a refill of lemonade. It is, all SELF service, So why, the exorbitant prices??  $13 For a half a wrap, for heaven's sake. 

 I got a rap, alright,  ""Baby, I got ripped...""


My friend had half a bowl of soup and a similar half a wrap, half the size of a normal wrap, (we have bought wraps, before, at Pita Jungle, full wrap, salad and you are waited on for $10.79)

...this is outrageous pricing...we could have ordered  two meals, with salad and appetizer at Chili's for $22.  

Lesson learned, the decor is 5 star, food, service and prices 0 star.  So next time, if I ever return, I will order the cucumber mint lemonade and guzzle a few cups for $3.50 but no tiny food plates, big prices.  Remember it is 1966 inside your restaurant,  your prices should reflect that."
Negative	How is this place in business? I stopped in over the weekend and spoke with Rob in sales. I mentioned I was considering the C63S and would like lease pricing and to test drive the vehicle. He said they would not let me test drive and I explained I would never drive a car without driving it first. Who would? He absolutely refused. I then asked if he could give me some pricing on a lease and he said because I was not leasing today he wouldn't give me figures because he said they change daily. Unbelievable. Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I also test drove an M4 at chapman and received a lease quote that same day. This place is a joke
Negative	Used to be good. Now it is crap. Service and food have declined so much you'd think they are deliberately trying to go out of business. Too bad. Oh well, there's a million other places to dine.
Negative	Honestly this place is the spot to eat at! But the customer service this restaurant consists of is absolutely  absurd... the food is divine honestly!, but the cashier that has been serving me lately is tremendously rude . I come into the restaurant ready to put in my order but the service that i have gotten from the cashier was so rude. I understand  that u guys close An hour from now but that doesn't mean u have the right to give shitty service, you know what you signed up for. Like I've said before... great place to eat but the service is fucking terrible!
Negative	Super disappointed after reading the reviews. The food quality itself was good, but the service was horrific and the prices were way too much for what you get. We definitely will not be back.
Negative	While my experience with dental care was good, unfortunately, I can't say the same with the accounting department. When I obtained my care and services from them, I was expected to pay the entire amount in advance. In order to do this, I had to obtain financing and paid almost  $1000 in cash as well, the same day. The dental office received my insurance payment over a week ago, and despite repeated requests, that money, MY MONEY has still not been returned to me.  This is now creating other issues for me, as not being one of the Elite, that $550 is absolutely necessary to my budget. I am more than frustrated at this point, and seriously doubt I will be doing business with Abbey Dental in the future.
Negative	Do not use this company. We decided to go with Birkett Entertainment and mail a check for the initial deposit totaling 500 dollars the week that we cancelled the wedding. The contract was never signed. Birkett Entertainment especially Chris Birkett is highly unprofessional, unethical, insensitive and extremely rude. My mother and I called the company on behalf of my ex fiancé indicating he needs his money back and the check cancelled. Chris Birkett told my mother and I we were liars and demanded a list of our vendors to call and confirm the wedding was cancelled. I told my ex he needed to cancel the check but it was too late. Chris Birkett was rude to him and demanded he come to his house in person so that he could consider refunding his money. Chris Birkett gave him back less than 200 of a 500 deposit with no services delivered agreed upon in a less than 7 business day timeframe. Do not hire this company, and if you do hope that you can be treated respectfully by Chris Birkett should you encounter any problems.
Negative	"This 1 star is for the response provided from the business.  The customer is not always wrong as it appears is the philosophy being taken.  Please respond honestly and keep the facts straight.  The manager called to tell me he did not mean to have this happen to me, that is all that was said.

The company is acting like only one technician came out. 
Two came out to my house, not one.  Is it customary to send out two plumbers to give just an estimate?  Fact is, I was told I would be able to have work done.  I am confused why in the response he said only one worker came out... I was also told that Monday, NOT Saturday was the soonest they could schedule me.

I told the woman on the phone when she asked if I would like to reschedule, that I can't I need to have this done today.  I was never told at that point, this can't be done.  This was not a mystery of the expectations for the work to be done.  I was told that the work I was having done was common stuff and if nothing had to be special ordered it could be done then at the time of them giving me the estimate. That night, despite what is being said by plumbsmart, they did not keep their word or even try.  That tells me a lot.

I had plumbers come on Saturday, the next day, from a different company installed everything in less then two hours.  I was not planning on writing this, but all the comment had so much false information I thought I should point it out.

To summarize
Two plumbers came not one (they were planning to install)
They never offered Saturday install as stated
They knew I was expecting Friday install from talking to scheduler, original appt, two plumbers came.
The company is acting like none of this happened and the bad experience is the customer's fault.
Nothing was done to try to make it so we could have the planned party at our house.  When asked if we could at least get the sink hooked up, it was a no."
Negative	"This location is a joke. The bartender/ ""waitress"" has horrible service she's rude. There is a reason this location has 3 stars. Mind you, it was the second time we visited this  location. Don't waste your time."
Negative	"2.5 stars - not bad / not great.

I came here many years ago and had a good experience, so one night when I was craving greek food, my boyfriend and I made our way over to Greektown. We arrived at Mezes just after 9 and were able to get seated right away, even though it was still pretty busy.

We decided to go with the Assorted pites - A sample of all their pites: Spanakopita, one Tirokafteropita and one Pantzaropita ($8.95). 
- Spanakopita (spinach pie): the filling was just too salty for my liking
- Tirokafteropita (feta cheese, hot peppers and yogurt): Didn't really taste much of the hot peppers, overall just an okay pite
- Pantzaropita (beets, leeks): the filling was so flavourful and delicious. easily my favourite one (although i'm not sure that's saying very much)

Our next dish was the Grilled Kalamari - Fresh grilled kalamari, dressed with a balsamic vinegrette and topped with fresh onions ($13.95). It was grilled nicely and wasn't too chewy. The balsamic vinegrette was also nice. This was a decent dish.

Since we had ordered two starters, we decided to share the Pork Souvlaki Dinner - Served with salad, roast potatoes, and rice ($16.95).  The pork was on the dry side, but tasted okay with the tzaziki sauce. The rice and potatoes were pretty standard. Just a meh dish... and overall, just a meh experience."
Negative	I am a frequent visitor of this franchise but at the local Summerlin location. This restaurant by far has the worst customer service. The hostess have no idea what they are doing while standing at front counter giggling. The restaurant is always under staffed for servers and you will sit and wait for 20 minutes with a room full of open tables. After waiting 20 minutes the hostess lead us down a row of tables to a spot the server advised he could not seat anymore people in at this time! I would not recommend this location for dining.
Negative	"I concur with the majority of the one star reviews here. The selection of shows leaves a lot to be desired. Their website is not optimized for mobile use and is garish and unprofessional. Yet, there is value in a service like this and I don't think they're overpriced; just not nearly as well organized or resourced as their competitors (e.g. Houseseats). 

So while the lack of variety in entertainment and rubbish interface contribute to my one star rating, the primary reason I give them the worst score I can is all to do with service. Recently I contacted them via email due to an issue I had with purchasing a gift membership. I expected a reply that included a greeting, an apology/acceptance of responsibility for the issue, steps taken to resolve the issue and follow up contact details. You know, basic customer service stuff. All lacking.  In fact, there was smug, condescending, accusatory rhetoric in its place. Beyond disappointing. Consequently, the gift membership I was going to purchase went to houseseats instead.

So if the lack of shows isn't enough to turn you off fillaseat, make it the customer service (or distinct lack thereof) that does it for you. Go to houseseats."
Negative	I went to World Buffet on Mothers Day to 499 D'Onofrio Dr.  & it will not be happening again ever.  I asked not up stairs.  I can do 2 steps but not full stairs.  And I asked for a table not a booth. The guy laughed.  They seated a family of 3, then a family of 2 I watched the family of 2 go up 2 steps to a table.  I looked the guy in the eye and he said we have no tables yet. And he laughed at me.   I went back to my daughter out loud talking to her I said why don't we go to Journey on the East side of town where we can relax and Enjoy more these people are so RUDE.  I am not spending my money in a place where people laugh at your requests.  That is so very bad CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I will never ever step foot in there ever again.  I understand they were busy.  Journey was even busier.  But my requests were met with a smile. World Buffet you suck for customer service.
Negative	"Leased from Serifina for two years and overall it was a disappointing experience.  The property has become increasingly run down over this time.  Management was difficult to work with at times.  Their bill department was increasing delinquent with processing the monthly invoices, to the point of arriving a day or two until payment was due.

I experience countless water outages over my period there.  Many times I could have to go without basic sanitation.

There are several nicer properties in Ahwatukee and this one should be avoided.

Update:  Upon leaving the property, management undertook some questionable billing practices.  I left the property on good terms, placing the required 60 day notice and paid the remaining balance due.  Several weeks later I received and additional invoice for additional charges and withheld the security deposit.  

Please avoid this property."
Negative	"This pharmacy is a joke. 
I went in on 12/23 to pick up an RX that was ready, and update my insurance. It was updated but when they tried submitting it it kept giving them an error. 
They said they would call the insurance 12/24 when they opened and get it straightened out. 
Around 11 am on 12/24 I contacted them and they said they hadn't gotten in contact with the insurance yet. A little later I received a call from them but no message left. Next thing I get an auto call that the RX is ready, so I go thinking everything is well. 
I go and they say they still have not gotten in contact with the insurance yet as they were closed. When asking why they couldn't give a straight answer. 
I had to give 18$ for 2 pills to get me through til after the holiday. 
I called my insurance then and I was able to reach someone who said everything was fine, the store transmitting the info was causing the error as everything was fine in their end and they created an override in the system so the RX could be gotten. So not only did they did they lie about contacting the insurance, they just wanted to charge 18$ for 2 pills when a 30 day RX was only 30$ with my insurance. 
I go back and the people were not very helpful again and didn't want to do anything. The pharmacist was the one to fix everything but she also was not very nice. This place SUCKS on customer service !!!!!"
Negative	"My husband and I came in for massages. We have gone to reflexology before. This is the first one with beds instead of chairs which was different but it was comfortable. They started by placing our legs in a water bucket but the water was lukewarm. But I get it, I'm sure people complain about the water being too hot. I had a male do the massage and his hands smelled so strong of cigarette smoke. I am sure he did not wash his hands after smoking and came right in and got to work rubbing his dirty hands ALL over my face. I almost asked him to stop right there. Add in his smokey breath and I almost lost it but I didn't want to complain and ruin the experience for my date. 
Other than that the massage was good. When he moved away from my face, the smell didn't bother me as much. My skin smells of cigarettes after arriving home. 
I called afterward to complain, and was told ""sorry, next time ask for the female."" 
Not sure there will be a next time."
Negative	"Honestly, guys, you are lucky because of your touristic location. Have you opened your place in the Bay Area where there are lots of good competitive sushi places, you would be out of business in 3-4 weeks. 
Food: Very mediocre at best. Please don't tell me what is this red paste that you put inside your roll. In any case it ain't fish.
Service: Well, I ordered hot green tea, pot stickers for appetizer, and a roll. Waited for quite a while, the roll came first. I had to remind about the pot stickers. Seriously, serving an appetizer way after the main dish? What about the tea? The tea never came at all.
Price: The same roll in the best places in the Bay Area costs half the price and has much better quality. Same can be said about the pot stickers.
I leave conclusions to you. Just shared my experience."
Negative	"I advise everyone to NEVER put your trust in this location or give them any kind of business. I went in a few months ago for an oil change, and over the course of the service found out I needed my serpentine belt replaced. This was understandable considering the age of my car, it's mileage, and a squeal that had developed upon start-up. I have them replace the belt. They never gave me the old one (looking back: red flag). 

Then, frustratingly, the problems stated above resurface only weeks after the service. 

I take my vehicle to a highly-trusted local mechanic for an inspection and discover after they remove the belt from my car and show me personally that it's stripped smoother than a baby's ass. It looks like the old friggin' belt. Valvoline NEVER replaced my belt as I PAID for, and worse, there was a stripped bolt that was exacerbating the problem. It takes YEARS to wear down a belt to the shape this was in. 

I had the trusty local place fix the issue and haven't had a problem since. 

So, I ended up paying for services they seem to have never actually performed. I feel violated and taken advantage of (probably because I'm a woman-par for the course with the car repair industry). If you value your safety and the integrity of your car, DO NOT go to this Valvoline."
Negative	What a crappy airline! I will stick with United/ Continental airlines. At least they know how to take care of their elites unlike US air. They should upgrade their fleet of airplanes. Not sure what's worse, flying US air or staying at Motel 6.
Negative	"We met a couple of friends here yesterday and I was really looking forward to it.  We shared the chicken lemongrass potstickers, the Bulgogi beef buns, I had pad thai my son had the pork belly ramen and we shared the crab rangoon roll and the spicy tuna roll.  Our friends had the lobster nachos and we had a few bites of that as well.  The potstickers were the only menu item that was good and I use the term loosely.  The pad thai was so bland with no flavor and the shrimp and chicken were totally overcooked.  If it weren't for the sriracha that I had to ask for, I wouldn't have eaten it.  My son finished about 1/3 of the ramen.  I tried it and it was tasteless with the pork belly looking like ham....SOOO disappointing.  Top ramen tastes better than this.  The crab rangoon roll was also very bland and the spicy tuna roll didn't have a single hint of anything remotely spicy.  The few bites of lobster nachos we had were okay...again, very bland.  I understand this is Asian fusion....but jeez, talk about mediocre.  Sure it's probably somewhat our fault because we frequent actually Asian spots in CLE's Chinatown and Asian plaza....but the cooks at this place could learn a few things by taking a trip themselves.  We didn't finish the sushi....my kid left most of his ramen....and 80 bucks later I went home and had some hot-pepper cheese and crackers...which was much more tastier.  Service was subpar.  Maybe the guy was new...but he put in mine and my son's order before our friends and we were eating way before they were which also made for an uncomfortable experience.  Lastly, we were there at opening time (4ish) on a Saturday afternoon...so I don't want anyone thinking it was their ""busy"" time.  There were no excuses!  You can get spicier food at Panda Wok for a fraction of the price."
Negative	"I wanted to like this place....I really did!    It's the 3rd restaurant in this space in the 11 years we've lived in the area.  A fresh, bright and colorful interior change was so welcoming as was the 'full house' on our first visit.  The service was 'ok'....I cut them some slack because of it being a very busy night and the place being fairly new.  However, our waitress chose to stand and talk to the table next to us telling them about her life, rather than complete our order.
The first bit of food arrived - nothing to brag about.
Our entrees arrived and were kind of tossed onto the plate.  Mine was barely warm (I am a stickler for hot food being served hot - don't just warm the plate and call it acceptable).  We decided we'd give it a try another time.
The second visit was similar to the first, except that there wasn't a large crowd, there were empty tables and yet we had about a 20 minute wait.  We sat at the end of the bar where servers were constantly coming up to get drinks for customers.   A big annoying.
The food service wasn't prompt nor accurate and once again, the plates were slopped up with food and sauce, barely warm and noting to brag about.
I won't go back.  I give it a couple of months longer and they too will close their doors.
If I had to guess, I would say most of the food is prepared ahead of time so it's not really 'fresh'.   Nothing is loaded with flavors...pretty bland and boring
The location is fantastic!   Lots of homes around the area...a mixed crowd of young families and a senior community.   Seniors go out to eat and we like places close to home!!! !"
Negative	Nasty! My husband and I went to the Mexican food station to serve ourselves and a cockroach comes running by, of course we mention it to the guy over seeing the area he kills it and picks it up with a towel and never said one word. There was no way we were eating there we told the cashier what happened, and I guess he was the manager told him and he had nothing to say. The cashier gave us our money back and that's it.... only gave it one star because it made me.
Negative	Having spent a few years in Japan roaming the streets looking for good eats. Ramen houses were always the best with no need for trying to understand the kanji menus as a rockie. When I came across this place serving tan tan mein noodles I went bizarre about wanting to try some. I came during lunch time on a weekday and it was pretty packed so I took that as a great sign. The place is on the smaller side but it made me feel at home in Japan even with the modern design. I sat on a tiny two person table towards the wall. When the nice pretty asian lady came to take my order it was a big dissapointment from the start. I was in the middle of ordering and the table next to me began speaking to her in her native tongue and she straight up left me with the words in my mouth to get them sodas. Kind of rude I would say! I asked for an order of gioza and they told me they did not have any! WHAT? Why have it on the menu if you do not serve it, let alone carry it? You can not eat ramen and not accompany it with gioza! So I ordered tan tan mein noodles with much anticipation. When my bowl arrived, the bowl looked liked they had poured milk in it. The noodles were creamy?!?! Real tan tan mein noodles are composed of a spicy broth not a spicy milky broth like if it was curry. I understand there are many versions on how to make tan tan mein but this one was wayyyyy too creamy The ground pork was alright but it did not have great consistency, it was a bit like sand in my opinion. I'm on a tan tan mein fix so if anyone knows of a better place, please do tell.
Negative	Underwhelming.. Food very basic.  Sorry but I don't see them making it very long unless they get more creative with their food. I give them 9-12 months. Sorry just being realistic.
Negative	Unfortunate service snafus ruin good cuisine. On a Sunday eve there was no manager on site just a disinterested hostess. The kitchen or waiter forgot two of our dishes but when we finally got them the food was 4 star worthy. Hopefully, upper mgt will take note of the disastrous service reviews on Yelp and turn this restaurant around.
Negative	Worst place in mgm. Don't dare to go.! If you gonna be late you have to pay the full price and they were going to resechedule you mgm grand policy. Go somewhere else.
Negative	"I used to goto this Dominos about once a week when they had just released the new pizza. And you know what, it wasn't that bad if you ordered it without the overpowering garlic crust. Plus, this location had a carryout special for a large one topping for $4.99. Hard to beat that. 

I went back and they had the same deal, but offered made to order pizzas instead. So you don't have to call ahead, they just have them there in an incubation chamber or some shit. The difference is, these were like super-processed pizzas and totally nasty. I was hoping this sketch area could provide some decent, cheap pizza but I was wrong. Fuck Dominos. They suck. I would say that the employees here are usually nice."
Negative	"I have been to other fondue places before so I knew what to expect when we hit the door of this higher class restaraunt in a very high class neighborhood.  I came in with a Groupon and didn't know menu prices.  

As I found out later, saying the Groupon covered a meal for two was like saying you can wear a swimsuit to church.  We had a reservation but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated and this was on a weekday at 4:30 PM.  

We chose our meals and the food was very good.  We also had a nice interaction with our server Meg M. She told us she was going on vacation the next week to the Bahamas.  We wished her well and finished and paid for our meal.

TWO COMPLAINTS.  1. The Groupon no where near covered the cost of the meal minus drinks, not even close.  The bill was more than double what the Groupon covered   2. More importantly, the next monday I get a notice from my bank asking me about a $1300 charge on Caribbean Airlines.  Imagine my suprise and anger.

I called the restaraunt and talked to the manager about what happened and she basicly told me her staff is honest and I have to be mistaken.  I was treated like I was the one that took something from them.  The manager wouldn't ever concider the possibility that her staff could have done this.

Note:  when you pay there like most higher class places, your card leaves your sight.  It's easy for a server to copy the info as well as the 3 digit number on the back.

I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I ENCOURAGE OTHERES NOT TO."
Negative	This is not the nicest Rabba I have been to. Prices seem higher than other locations and sandwiches taste a little stale. The only thing this place has great hours  If you are looking for a late evening snack, Sobeys is a much better option!
Negative	"Came here few days ago for the Summerlisious - it was so disappointing! For 20$ lunch you would expect something fairly decent but the food was really bad. We had to add sauces and salt for it to be eatable.
If you come for a beer I`m sure it`s a nice place but don`t bother to order food, really. You`d be better eating in a foodcourt:/"
Negative	"I lived here for about two years because I liked the area because it was new (back in 2007) ya that was a bad mistake this building are not made well at all there is dog poop everywhere, bugs everywhere, and the trash cans were always full.

Don't spend your money here!"
Negative	"Comfortable atmosphere playing American pop music. Spent $40. Summary is a fast food version of Korean food where they cut costs by using cheap ingredients and attempt to supplement for real ingredients while cheating the consumer with overpriced food. This seems to be the trend in Pittsburgh. We had the noodles with bulgogi and seaweed salad, the rice with (Korean Fried Chicken) KFC, sweet potato tempura, miso soup and a chamomile tea. Chamomile tea was $3.  Miso was comparable to the miso you can purchase at Walmart but bae bae's is $3. I personally think the out of the whole meal the sweet potato tempura was the best because of the creamy spicy wasabi sauce. Their KFC was chicken tenders with
 Japanese breadcrumbs on it and tastes like the oil it was fried in with no seasoning. There was some honey wasabi sauce they added on the side but it did little to make up for the lack of effort placed in making the food. The seaweed salad was imitation made of cucumber (!) and was basically an attempt to take a short cut to make a base for their daily side the Crab Salad. The beef bulgogi had enough fat and tendon on it you might choke trying to swallow it (why did I pay for fat and tendon?) they also have half cups of iced tea. If you order one they fill it with ice and you may be fooled into believing you got what you payed for. Don't settle for the Americanized dumbdown version get the real thing at the Korean Garden in Shadyside or the Korean restaurant in Oakland."
Negative	This review is based on the only time that I've been to this restaurant. The staff seemed to be overwhelmed and unorganized. Even the manager didn't seem to have it together. I started to feel concerned about what the food would be like. It look a very long time to get our meals and drinks. The food was actually very good. We were all pleasantly surprised. With that said, if you're not in a hurry and you don't mind spending two hours here then give it a try.
Negative	"Spray Tan- go somewhere else.  Although the results aren't horrible, the service and area for spray tanning were unacceptable, especially considering the cost.  I waited nearly 20 minutes.  Was escorted into a dingy common change room to undress.  The worst was the room where the airbrushing took place, it was basically a shower stall, very dingy and unkept, and poorly ventilated, they had to keep the door partially open, and there was no discussion of safety, no nose protection offered.  Then, for me to dry, I was escorted back to the change room and given a blow dryer to dry myself off....I tried for 20  minutes, and I still wasn't dry.  The esthetician didn't even assist me at all.  Meanwhile other clients were walking in on me naked while I was trying to dry my tan.

Very disappointing."
Negative	"The valet did not give me and my two young children a ticket when we dropped the care off at the valet. When I got to the room I called down and spoke with a nice lady in the valet booth who found my car under my last name. When I got to the valet a rude and pushy valet attendant refused to give me my keys after I showed the valet booth attendant my license.  After my kids hopped on the car she still refused to give me my keys even after the booth attendant told her the car had been parked under my name and that she verified me by my driver's license. My kids who were hungry and tired had to wait until the hotel manager arrived before we were finally given our keys. 
What happened to Las Vegas? This was the town where the service was impeccable. Now the servers are angry about working and angry in general. Bring back the service with a smile that made this town what it is today."
Negative	Worst hotel / time share or whatever you want to call it.  Room service is non existent.  The plumbing in two rooms were all messed up.  out of the 50 something floors only two of the floors have Ice for you and twice one was empty and I had to cruise down 48 floors to get to the other level with ice.  I asked for limes to make drinks in my room before we went to XS for the night each lime cost $4.00, really?  Most hotels give you limes and other condiments if needed.  I ordered extra blankets for the pull out couch and it took them almost two hours to get them to my room. (its not even a holiday weekend)  I would much rather stay at the regular Planet Hollywood or just pay the extra price and stay somewhere that respects me more and could get me into the clubs for staying with them.
Negative	"It's already been 2 weeks waiting for the part to come in to fix our Space-Pac air conditioner, during Toronto's major heat wave. I'm told it's the norm for parts to take 4 weeks, so we are facing another two weeks before it's fixed. It's 27 degrees inside my house and it's only 8:25 am. And my brother, who was seriously ill last year and is now in remission, is arriving in less than a week.

It should NEVER be the norm for customers to have to wait a month for their air conditioner to be fixed. Our summer is only 3 months long as it is. I had this part replaced only last year at great expense. It must be coming from Asia, which perhaps explains why it's broken already. 
It's great that it's under warrantee and Ed is very nice on the  phone, but that's not enough. You'd better figure out how to do better than this Belyea Brothers, because this is simply unacceptable."
Negative	"My husband and I used to love the perch! That is where we had our first date. But the last two experiences left us sad and disappointed. They say they are dog friendly, but there is nothing friendly when you bring your dog. When I had called and asked, the hostess was clearly annoyed that she had to say yes they were dog friendly...We went anyways. Bad mistake. We get there and both hostesses were rude. They had said there was a 30-35 min wait. (Open tables everywhere). We decided to walk downtown while we wait and within 5 mins we get a text. We turn back, and she puts us in the very back nasty corner of the restaurant with a crooked table. After NO service and poor service we left and will never go back. Too bad. And no The Perch is not ""dog friendly""."
Negative	"Meh, I've had much better. There are a ton of restaurants in Vegas in this price option with a much higher quality of food. The service, decor, and menu were all good. I'll go through our orders now:

Pig ear Pad Thai- Solid dish, the flavors were nice and this had a nice blend of sweetness from the papaya salad. 

Thai Style Pork Ribs- The best dish we had- very flavorful and tender. Would get this again for sure.

Spanish Octopus- It could have used a bit more char. Decent flavor but I've had much better.

Yellowtail Collar- I wasn't a fan of this; not necessarily because of the taste, but more due to the portion sizing and it was slightly overcooked.

Beef short ribs (Korean style)- Go to any Korean BBQ place and these are pretty much the exact same. These weren't different than anything I have had before. This did have the best value at this restaurant, though. 

All in all, I've had much better. I like the concept a lot (small plates/slightly upscale), but the flavors weren't there and I thought that none of these dishes really stood out in any way, shape, or form. Sushi Samba in the Venetian is superior for similar prices."
Negative	"The Watershed is located in a pretty nice area and sits right on the side of a lake with great views. The inside is wide open with high ceilings, a bar and a pool table.
Everything seemed to be fairly clean and our waitress was friendly enough. There were a couple things I found off putting though.
I went for breakfast on a Sunday with several people right as they were opening.
 
1.) When we were seated we were given dinner menus and then no one came back to the table for 15min. Once someone did finally come back around we asked for the appropriate menu only to be given the dinner menu again! We were eventually able to get the right menus though.

2.) There are no condiments on the tables. Not a big deal in itself but when you only see your server once every 30min you realize how nice it is to have salt, sugar for your coffee, etc. Also note we were one of 2 tables in the entire restaurant.

3.) I actually made note more of when we placed our order and it took 1 hour for the food to come out. Most of the order was just eggs...

4.) Multiple orders were wrong! Some of the group I went with asked for things like no cheese or no onions but none of that happened.

5.) PRICEY! My order consisted of 2 eggs, 1 tortilla, a handful of diced potatoes and 2 strips of thin bacon. $11 easy.

6.) The server never returned...
 
Those were the main problems and as far as the food... just okay. Watershed has a lot of potential that they are doing nothing with. I don't see myself returning here again."
Negative	"This is for takeout review.

Honey fried chicken. It's one of my fav in the city. I'm glad it's still on the menu. The times I've ordered takeout it has been inconsistent. One time it was burnt. Today the side dish changed. This is the most drastic change to this dish in my 5 times ordering it. It came with couscous that has olives that doesn't go with the friend chicken!!! It doesn't matter if you gave me lots, it just doesn't go well with it!!! I'm used to this pickled veg with chickpea side that balances out the greasy taste not couscous that is absorbing it and those olives just adds salt to it all. Why? 

Chicken is still good but the side was a disaster."
Negative	unfortunately i have to give at least one star or else i wouldn't give anything. Went to the dealership last week to look for a car for my wife. It's sad to know that the sales team has no ethic and professionalism when it comes to females customers. My wife and i decided to just leave the dealership because she was feeling uncomfortable when the sales guys were staring at her and they were talking between them and looking at my wife. It seems like those guys from that dealership never seen a female. Really awful experience. Not recommended at all!!!!!
Negative	Yuck . Dingy, dirty , depressing . Holes in wallpaper, stains on carpet and furniture . Shocking . I travel all the time and expect more for this price . Not sure if I can even sleep here . Will not walk around barefoot certainly . There must be better options out there in this price range but I have not found them yet ! Note to Hilton ... maintain your hotels or this diamond member is finding a new hotel chain.
Negative	"After seeing all the cool looking cakes with various stars holding them we were so excited when there was the BYOB (Bring your own box)$1.00 a cupcake promotion. 
The location was a bit confusing to find so we called for help but the phone number came up as not working but with our love for cupcakes we were determined to find this place and we did...
It's a catering kitchen and the building said Renaissance Catering Inc. There was a sign that said ""Cupcakes-ring doorbell or knock"" So we knocked and out came a lady who let us know right away that they were out of Chocolate, the banana is just being put in the oven and the yellow will be ready in 15,20 min. Funny thing was those were the 3 flavors that we wanted but I guess everyone else wanted them as well...
I came ready to buy $30.00 worth but to my surprise it was cash only so luckily we came up with $16.00-so 16 cupcakes it was. 
If an event is cash only then that needs to be stated well in advance so that people come with cash-cause who really carries cash anymore?
We got a little of each flavor available which was Red Velvet,Coconut and White Cake. 
We noticed that there were cans of store bought frosting in the kitchen which was very surprising to me- I just figured we were getting a full homemade cupcake. The Frosting was too sweet for my taste and the cake was OK...I guess after seeing all the cool hella hard to make cakes I was just expecting the WOW factor but aftering trying each one of them I was not wowed. The cakes on the site are beautifully done but I don't think much was put into these cupcakes at all. For $1.00 each it was still a good deal though money wise..."
Negative	"For the price ($10) I expected a bit more. We did get to see an exhibit of the dead sea scrolls which was incredible (this was a temporary installment which has since left). However, the rest of the museum is disappointing. It felt like such a tease to see amazing artifacts and then read that they were reproductions. The dead sea scrolls were so amazing, partly because it is fascinating to stand before something that is so old and so important and think about the people so long ago who may have held or touched or seen those items. After this, the rest of the museum feels a bit fake because almost everything is a replica, not the real deal.

One very interesting exhibit contained WWII era postcards. Interesting, but the museum only has a few. I could have stood there and read these all day if they had more, but there was only a handful so I moved on.

You can probably see the whole museum in about 30 minutes. For the price tag, it's really not worth a trip (in my opinion). Check out the section on Judaism at your local library instead (for free!)."
Negative	This place needs serious help. I called a takeout order and the wait was 40 minutes. I went ahead and placed my order. Forty minutes later, I walked in and there were several people waiting who all looked agitated. I pay for my order and cashier says it will be another 15 minutes after I pay.
Negative	Went there with my girlfriend to watch football. Didn't mind it being fairly busy. When we did get an open seat we waited for over 15 minutes with the prior patrons food in front of us, after we informed the server. The server stated they would get our server, after they retuned to get our order (with the food in front of us still) we decided to move on. For a sports bar having only what appeared to be 2 servers and one food runner with a lot of uncleared plates and poor service. They do not have their act together and was not a great way to start the Saturday. We will not be returning.
Negative	Slow and poor service: Never got to eat. We had brunch reservations for a group of 30 and they thought it was for 20. We waited 25 minutes for them to bring extra chairs to our table. Finally, we went and grabbed three chairs from other tables. After being at the table for an hour, our order still had not been taken, and my wife and I had to leave to checkout. Not sure how it went for the rest of our party.
Negative	Heard it was under new management so hubby and I went to check it out and to see the comedy show. What a disappointment! Place looks like a dive, soda for mixed drinks came out of a bottle which was flat, which by the way I still had to pay for, and food menu was a joke. Not going to stay in busines long when you let your employees drink behind the bar.
Negative	Only reason why I gave 2 stars was because of the customer service i got which was great. When I arrived she welcomed me and was great throughout the tour. I couldn't give it any higher because i'm very annoyed and upset. Came to view this place all the way from Summerlin and I get in the model which looks stunning inside. BUT BEWARE the model looks nothing like the unit you will get as was shown to me after the model. Ceilings are 3 ft lower which makes it look way smaller. The vinyl flooring in the model you will NOT be getting which makes a big difference. The unit you get is nothing you see in the model. If it looked like the model and was the same obviously without all the furniture and etc it would've had me sold.... Don't waste your time...
Negative	Walked in at 10:15 and they completely ignored me, I mean not even a word.  I never ever complain about service but this was just ridiculous.  At least address me and tell me it's closed, but ignoring the situation is unacceptable.  I've been here a dozen times and I've enjoyed myself, just let down.
Negative	DO NOT GO HERE, its a long wait and the food has no flavor, the only decent thing is the corn. Just a horrible place, it doesn't even deserve half a star.
Negative	"Surprise, Surprise, Surprise! Another phony clone. Really folks, all of your customers aren't naive vacationers who don't have a clue about what good food is supposed to taste like. 

We're (unfortunately) in Vegas a few times a year on business and went to Bouchon for an early 6:30 dinner after working all day at a trade show. We didn't have a reservation and were offered a table on the outdoor patio. I protested that it would be too hot since I knew it was over 100 degrees out there. The hostess added ""it's not too bad"".... I should have added: ""we're here for dinner, not Bikram yoga""....I Googled the weather and found that it was 105 degrees. Up dog, down dog.... 

They miraculously found us an inside table. We were not famished and ordered: 

onion soup (I ate mine, wifey's went back: too salty and just not good). 

mushroom quiche - undercooked to the point where the egg was still runny (wifey sent back, they cooked it more, still nauseating)..... 

side order of green beans (haricot verts) okay, nothing special 

side order of ratatouille (more salty than the Dead Sea)

Action:  apologies.  soup and ratatoulle removed from bil.  Free extremely marginal dessert given.   Halved yellow cherries ON TOP of FOLDED crepes with a sugary sauce and tiny scoop of bland ice cream....This was ""on the house"" after I reminded the waiter that it was supposed to be on him.  

We had a couple glasses of acceptable wine.  

Verdict: Guilty.  Just another Vegas shit hole with a fancy name."
Negative	I went to this location around 11:30 pm and ordered a shaken passion iced tea with lemonade. The cup was filled completely with ice, and only had about 1/4 cup of actual tea in it. The barista needs to be trained properly to make well proportionate drinks.
Negative	"Decided to do a ""Jewish Xmas"" ... Chinese food and a movie. Wish we had skipped the Chinese food. First and last time at Great Wall. My Vegetarian Lo Han was simply tasteless. Walked out with a stale taste in my mouth and couldn't wait to find desert or something sweet to clear my palate. The menus are labeled ""15% gratuity added"" but the server could not seem to clarify if our bill included the gratuity or not. We left a 20% cash tip and paid the bill at the front counter. The proprietor took my bill and cash payment, slipped it into the drawer, and started serving other customers. I had to ask for my change ... and added 'tip left at the table' in case there was some confusion. That was awkward at best and cheating at worst. Will not return."
Negative	"I went here for lunch on a Saturday and had an extremely negative experience. I ordered the half chicken sandwich/soup combo. They were short on staff and it took 25 minutes for my order to arrive. The soup was extremely cold and the sandwich WAS NOT FRESH. I am pretty sure the chicken has been out for a while and not stored at the proper temperature. Despite their claim as using ""fresh"" ingredients, I was very disappointed in quality and value of meal. Because I was running late to a meeting (didn't think my order would take 25mins), I could not go back to the restaurant to have them fix the issue. Never again."
Negative	I came in today to get a piercing and the hours on the door as well as on here stated that they opened at 1pm on Mondays. I showed up with a friend at 1:30pm and again at 3pm and there was no one to be found. There was no note on the door and no reasoning on the answering machine when I called. I'm very disappointed and took my business to another shop. You'd think a business with 4 1/2 stars would be run better than this.
Negative	"I've been a loyal fan of this place for over 10 years.

What happened to your Prime Rib???? It was so awful, me and the others in my party took a few bites and did not eat it. First off, it was disgustingly salty as if we put a spoon full of salt in our mouths. Second of all, it was obvious that you went to a lower grade meat. I do NOT call this slab of meat Prime Rib. It was like some nasty slab of meat that could not even be cut w a knife. All of the people in our party agreed. We complained to the waiter who then told us we were not the first people to complain that night and that many others complained as well. What did he do? He took the prime rib off our bill and charged us for ""all you can eat salad bar"" that came with the prime rib. Whoop di do!! Prime rib is $9.99, all you can eat salad bar is just a few dollars less. I've been getting your prime rib every year for the past 10 years and it's obvious this is NOT the same grade of meat, it honestly tasted like Ass.

I gave stars because the ox tail soup reminds outstanding. The mahi mahi was still outstanding as well.

A big fat zero to no longer having daily specials we could use our Hawaiian Package coupons on where Vacations Hawaii advertises ""free meals."" These are all gone. Now, coupons only can be used for breakfast and saimin. Boo!  Customers notice when you cut costs like this."
Negative	"While Sushi Kawa wasn't terrible, there was nothing memorable or essential about the experience.

Their gyoza didn't have that one golden crispy side, and was just an average dumpling!

The tuna sashimi was a generous chunk and quality was much better than the to.ro I also ordered, which was too thin and fibrous. 

The deep fried spicy salmon roll was a little strange. There was too much rice to salmon and next to no mayo  or spiciness.  The salmon almost seemed to have come out of a can, which I know it didn't but it wasn't the texture you're expecting.

Dragon roll missed the mark too. Avocado wasn't ripe enough and the unagi was sparse and not nearly enough of the glaze I'm used to enjoying with it.

We ordered the special california roll as well as the calamari roll. The Special California roll was fine, lots of crab. The calamari roll's squid was overcooked so it was chewy.

The wasabi and ginger was very generous, and a good thing since you'll probably need it.

I did enjoy their rice, which was pleasantly sweet and held together well.

If you just need a sushi fix and you're in the area, all this was only $60, which isn't too bad, but there is better sushi out there!!"
Negative	"I really had high hopes for this place, after all the good reviews, so I went in there with a picture of what I wanted my hair color to look like, and asked her if she could get the hair color I wanted without using bleach, she said she could so I went ahead with it, I had blonde highlights from my previous balayage and wanted an even color all over, which I mentioned to her. My hair right now just has a tint of brown. 
Later when I asked told her it's not light enough she said it will be extra to lighten it.
I could have understood if she told me in the beginning that my hair couldn't come to that color without bleach.
The reason I am giving her 2 stars is because she gave me a good haircut and put in some treatment for my hair because it was my wedding coming up"
Negative	"I contacted the office this morning after being referred to Dr. Moss for an issue.  I spoke to a very terse receptionist on the phone.  I asked to make an appointment.  She asked what insurance I had, I responded that I have ChampVA.  She stated that the office isn't a provider for ChampVA and that I should contact my insurance company to see what doctor was on my provider list.
  I called ChampVA and was told that I have an open referral insurance and can make an appointment with any doctor that I choose.
  I called rude receptionist back and patiently explained to her that my insurance would cover my visit.  She stated that it would not and refused to make an appointment for me.
  If the staff is that obnoxious on the telephone, then no thank you for an app't!

Negative	"I have been three times now and it keeps getting worse. Sunday morning it was busy and they just do not have enough help. We got our coffee and juice and I asked for a spoon to stir my sugar and cream into my coffee and by the time the spoon came coffee was cold. I ordered Plain Jane Eggs Benedict which advertised lots of hollandaise. The ""lots of hollandaise"" turned out to be about two tablespoons full and so I asked for more sauce........again a long wait so I ate one of the eggs and then when the sauce came I poured it over my other egg and the potatoes. When I took a bite I found the sauce was refrigerator cold!  Prices are on the high side and it just is not worth it.  Coffee had grounds in it.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous, however!"
Negative	Really disappointed! Yesterday I ordered edamame and a side order of fried chicken which was three small perfect sized pieces and it was $4.50 today I ordered the same exact thing got the same exact amount of food and it was $7.50. I asked the bartender and he basically said oh well they changes that bc lots of people were ordering it but you get more. (Not only did I not get more, I didn't want more.)  Feeling swindled when 5 minutes prior to ordering I was bragging to all my coworkers about how amazing it is there.
Negative	"so here is the thing i came back here after having a pleasant experience last time in Vegas but this was the worst. first the host man was very nice. I was sat at a table from the time i was sat at the table the waiter seemed to not be feeling me. I dont know why. literally he approaced my tabled with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered with me. i thought whatever just give me my food and ill be out. Let me tell you this man never came to check on me. i saw him when he took my order, when i asked for a new dish and that was it ill get to the rest. 

So i ordered sophie or sophias salad something like that as I just wanted vegetables. it was ok needed more dressing and a cut of protein wouldnt have hurt.so im eating the salad and halfway through (its very small) when i see what can only be described as a produce sticker in the salad. ugghhhh so i waved him down (again this man never came to check on me) to tell him there was a piece of paper in the salad. he simply said oh ill take this back. I then see him walk all around the restaurant making stops with the tainted salad adn then he finally takes it back. he comes back about 5 minutes later and says they are going to get this to you as soon as they can. what you mean as soon as they can? its a barely there salad. the salad literally consisted of romaine, large blocks of white cheddar and some canned kidney and garbanzo beans and barely any dressing i say ok but im thinking what in the entire fIIK. there was NEVER and apology or any offer of a complimentary bread, 50cents off nothing!!

i dont know what the people are called who refill but the man who kept refilling my water and brought my bread was phenomenal!! idk how restaurants work but he definitely needs to be a waiter instead of just water, appetizer man ..he was great not only did he refill be he checked on me appropriately as most restaurants at intervals asking if i was ok. He was great !! he seriously needs to be promoted to waiter if thats how it goes. i didnt catch his name ..he looked eritrean or ethiopian to me.

so i finally finish the new salad and im just ready to get out of there at this point as i was over it. I waited and i waited and i waited and nothing. i was dining alone so I take all my stuff with me. im just going to the bathroom. NO LIE!! at this point i COULD have just walked out of the restaurant without paying. the host and a female were saying good bye to me. and i was like oh im just going to the bathroom.. damn my moral compass. i should have just walked out. .i was completely fed up at this point so when i leave the bathroom i literally stand next to my table like YOO!!! im ready to go where is the check and who shows up?? oh not my waiter of course not his sorry excuse of a waiter but the wonderful busboy/water refill person. and says do you want me to take care of that for you? i say please!!!! i guess protocol dictates waiters have to do it. bc next i see sorry waiter ringing up the bill. he brings the check back and says thanks and scurrys off ..

i wanted to leave a tip with the other guy personally so bad as i trust no one at this restaurant at this point but he had disappeared. i left the waiter no tip.. sorry this is why i cant subscribe to the oh they only make $2 a hour argument. Im suppose to pay you for poor service when thats your job....service!!! and you KNOW thats how you actually get paid and still give poor service ... ummm methinksnot..*sigh* i only went here bc the bacchanal buffet line was ridiculous i was clueless and uninformed at the time..i now know..but i dont plan to ever step foot in vegas again so im good"
Negative	Another crappy hotel needing improvement in Vegas, what a surprise. First of all, the customer service is absolutely horrendous. I have never spoken with more unprofessional women in my entire life. They are completely attitude ridden and clearly hate their jobs, should probably reconsider hiring newer, more friendly employees. The hotel is completely outdated and smells like a mix of cigarettes and old fruit. Hair on the bed and pillow cases, dirt on the floor everywhere, and uncomfortable beds. Needs extreme improvement.
Negative	"Mario is a gem who should not be taken for granted. 

This does not change that I spent so much time here trying to get my prescription that my phone auto navigates me to the location when it notices I get in my car."
Negative	I would certainly avoid this place, for starters the staff give off the impression they don't care about their customers. On top of this, the sushi burrito I ordered made me sick with what I felt was dysentery. Avoid at all costs, not worth it.
Negative	I'm not very impressed with Haggen. I really miss albertsons when it was there. The prices in the entire store seem to have gone up by a lot which is annoying since it seems like a downgraded the staff there. The only bright sport they have is that they carry thrifty ice cream.
Negative	I completely take back my comments.  They are so slow that they hardly care and staff is uninterested and complacent.  Maybe lunch is busy but dinner is a ghost town. Ended up walking out after waiting 10 minutes to grab a beer before the hornets game.
Negative	"Sadly, this location in South Side Works used to house a beautiful Joseph-Beth Booksellers, but this bookstore closed about two years ago. This is the second Halloween season that the Spirit Halloween store has taken over this normally empty space.

The costume selection appeared to be relatively limited this year. I noticed that their fixtures were about half the height of what they were last year. They had a lot of costumes for kids, but not as many as I had anticipated for adults. I stopped by Spirit today to look for a dark brown or black wig for a costume. Their wig selection was very small, and I didn't find anything that I liked. I'll be checking out the Halloween store at the Waterfront. I shopped there last year, and the selection was significantly better than this store."
Negative	Love me some Pho, but this place is definitely not the place to go.  When entering we sat ourselves as indicated on the posted sign, and we could tell there was something wrong with the AC.  There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the menu and pricing didn't look too bad. They had my favorite Pho with rare steak. Our server Jonathan greeted us, no smile and it seemed like he was not happy to be there (bad vibe). He was pretty speedy and did check back, but his body language and chewing gum was difficult to get past. Our food came out and the quality of pho is way under par. It tasted like it had a beef bouillon base and the steak....well it wasn't rare.  It looked old.  I went to get chop sticks and a spoon and that is when I noticed all of the dead bugs on the windowsill just above the silverware.  I was disgusted at that point, so needless to say I just wanted to leave at that point.  Jonathan ran out check and he was talking to a coworker where he confirmed he was not in a good mood as he was telling his coworker he wasn't happy and used a few f-bombs. I do not recommend this place.  Go to china Town to Pho Kim Long. Same pricing and the food quality blows this place out of the water. Here's hoping I'm not sick in the morning, and I will be doing a first....calling the health department in the morning.
Negative	This place is so ridiculous. I'm sure the views are the only nice thing about this bar. We were in line and got told we were going to get in for free (party of 4 - two couples) and so we waited. A security guard comes to check ID while waiting in line and he looks me up and down and said I can't wear my sandals because it's not business casual. I told him the girls in front of us are wearing jean shorts and dirty vans slip ons. He changed his excuse to the top floor having glass shards and it is a liability for me to step on them?!?! ‍ wtf haha. Whatever so I went and changed my shoes and we came back. They check our IDs and stamp our wrists. Then another bouncer told my bf that his outfit is not business casual and that we can't go in. Im assuming they were more hesitant to let us in due to us coming as a couple and not a group of women. Sorry, but your club only has 35 reviews and is at 3.5 stars so good luck with that act you guys have going on - there are many other clubs/bars to enjoy in Vegas~
Negative	Bourbon burger. Ugh. Sounds appealing with caramelized onions, bourbon whisky sauce and cheddar cheese right? Nope. The whisky sauce is a sweet pungent sauce that does not go with this burger at all. If they wanna use a sauce, scrap this one and use something enjoyable. The burger patty is a frozen patty cooked on a grill which already is disappointing. There's little flavour from the burger...as good as it can be for a frozen patty. The caramelized onions taste like something like you'd get from A&W. UB just opened up in the Mississauga location under condo buildings and unless they pull something good outta their hats, I can't see this place surviving at all. Also, parking sucks. Bring extra quarters to fill the meter while you wait for your burger. Poor location. Poor quality of food. Poor customer service, the cooks were goofing around while the cashier was trying to yell out the order to them while she had waiting customers repeating the order. Huge disappointment of a burger joint. Not going back there. Good luck...
Negative	Maybe I came at the wrong time when the place just opened, we came at around 1:00 pm in the afternoon, for the price the food in my opinion was not very good, rice tasted like tomato sauce, beans straight out of a can with lots of cheese, and green chile was full of fatty beef and had absolutely no heat or flavor, I don't know maybe I'll try it when they got their top cooks in line, but the food I ate was terrible
Negative	"Horrible, in a word!! 
Their sandwiches are decent but their customer service is the worst!!  I use to pick up breakfast for a co-worker and myself a few times a month because it was right next door,  and they forget something EVERY SINGLE TIME!! They would charge me, of course, but then lie and tell me they didn't, even though I had the receipt!  I work in the industry so never made a big deal about it, I gave countless chances and excuses.  Until finally, I just stopped coming in.  I came in one more time after a year, again, for convenience, and they forgot the bacon on my sandwich.  When I went back in, they said they were out....That's fine, BUT WHY CHARGE FOR IT?!?  They have over charged me every friggin time and have forgotten something (no exaggeration) EVERY TIME, unless I check and go back.  But the worst of it?  They're never are apologetic or try and make it right, or ask me to come back in for a free coffee even?  They just aren't worth it, they are all around the worst I have ever experienced because of their consistency to disappoint and rip me off."
Negative	"Traffic was terrible and it was the middle of the week.  There were crowds of intoxicated people everywhere.  It was hard to get around and casinos seemed to be separated from each other by streets lacking safe ways to cross them.  I gues I am just not turned on by large mobs of people.  Also everything was exspensive so that explains the number of people at anything ""free"".  Except a lot of the freebies were closed.  I doubt I will ever go back."
Negative	Staff was friendly for sure. Good attitudes at 12:45 on a weds night. Unfortunately the food was blah. Ordered a few things, fried pickles burgers wings salad. 2 out of 5 is pretty bad. Pickles were undercooked fries hot were undercooked. Burger meat wasn't great and over cooked.  It felt half assed and unfinished. Should have guessed,  tables were barley bused and crumbs on my new plate. Thanks for being open. We were hungry. Wanted to like it. 74 dollars was too much for what was offered. Cook was obviously tired. Our Waitress Rachel was great. Attentive and positive. She made us smile and we liked her a lot.
Negative	"Very disappointing.

I came here recently with a friend hoping for flavorful Cuban food but we both found the food  to be mediocre as far as Cuban cuisine goes. I feel bad for leaving such a short review, but there just isn't much else to say. I can't complain about the service, wait time or the atmosphere, the food was just rather bland and very disappointing. 

I am a vegetarian and my friend a carnivore and we were both disappointed with the our meals. The food didn't taste horrible, it was just lacking in flavor (think Luby's) and we left with no reason to come back in the future. 

I have since heard that the Havana Cafe location down on E. Camelback is much better so will look forward to giving that location a try next time I am in the area. Hopefully I will have great things to report."
Negative	"This isn't really a restaurant, it strikes me more like a bar that serves food. 

Their soups were far too salty, completely inedible. 
The guacamole and chips with plantain was good but a very small portion. 
Had 2 tacos, the fish and beef. Beef was with a very runny/oily sauce. Fish taco was the best thing on the menu (that we tried). 

It strikes me they are going for the late night bar crowd who needs something to chomp on. 

Music was loud and waitresses were there for a reason (if you get my drift). 

Would only go back if I was in the area late at night and nothing else was open."
Negative	My husband bought a silent auction gift certificate which expired at the end of May. I could find the certificate until the end of September. I called and asked if I could still use it (and offered to not have all the services done). The receptionist took my information down and said her supervisor would call me. Two days later I called the salon again. The receptionist said her supervisor told her no the gift certificate was not usable. When i asked to speak to the supervisor i was told she was discussing the matter with the manager. 3 days later and still no call back. Poor customer service!
Negative	Not impressed with deli at all. Tried to order a sandwich and they don't have the bread for one of their specialty sandwiches on the menu. Poor guy in front of me tried to order the meal and the soda machine is broken and they can only substitute with a water, seriously????  Not a good way to compete with the new frys deli across the street.
Negative	"I reached out to 5 different security companies providing exact information, details, and specifications of what I wanted on Yelp. 4 our of 5 provided me with direct pricing and information. Progressive Home told me I needed to call someone or email someone. I explained Yelp is most convenient for me, and I was told I needed to send an email to info@xyz to get information. I then explained when someone is spending money, the company accommodates the client, not vice versa. They forget, they need the client, the client does not need them. I think this fact is lost on a lot of businesses nowadays. When someone is spending money voluntarily for goods or a service, you accommodate them. Period. And the request was literally for pricing, not for something absurd. I was responded to with ""I'm glad you have 4 other companies to go with"" So I have no idea how the quality of work Progressive does, but the customer service interaction was terrible, and I will be spending thousand(s) on a security system somewhere else solely based on the fact of how I was treated."
Negative	"Food: really can't complain about the food or price. Both are what you'd expect. Nothing to wow you but nothing to disappoint. 

Server: considering she was the only one with 5 tables I'm not upset but it wasn't the most attentive. 

Inside: they had to wipe our table in front of us because someone didn't. Host and supportive staff could be more attentive. They seemed disinterested."
Negative	It's Black Friday and I just heard an ad on the radio saying that Best Buy matches price guaranteed and free shipping. I went right in the store on east side of Madison wit my Walmart at in hand. I waited in the cyst service line til it was finally my turn. Only to be told they don't price match on Black Friday. Talk about false advertising. By y Best Buy. Mark me off your list
Negative	"I'm sure they are all very nice people.  But i should of walked out when i had the chance.  I scheduled a chem peel at the last minute on a Saturday.  I called at 1pm and they said they could see me at 3:15.  I got there 5 minutes early and checked in.  I then sat for over 40 minutes before someone said the person I was seeing was running behind.  No, really?  I kept getting ready to leave, but I really wanted to try a peel and i knew all other places around there would be closing soon.

Finally I get in to see the person I had the appt with.  She was really nice but was having an off day it seemed.  She couldnt find anything she needed, other staff came in and out of the room looking for stuff during the peel and the atmosphere was not at all relaxing.

When she started the peel, I guess it was supposed to tingle or something...I felt nothing.  She said we could do more ""layers"" but each layer cost an additional fee.  Fine, whatever.  We did all the ""layers"" allowed and I literally felt a slight tingle on the last layer.  Then she started going ""serum"" crazy.  Like Serum after serum after serum.  One was a vitamin C serum.  And it turned me oompa loompa orange.  So she hads me a mirror when she's all done and I'M ORANGE.  So she finally realizes it - blames the lighting - and starts trying to wipe it off.  But all the serums start coming off and its just falling off in chunks.  So she's like, eh good enough, otherwise I'll just rub all the stuff off...um, ok.  BUT I'M ORANGE!

She kept telling me I'd peel a bunch in by Monday and I needed to use this really good moisturizor.  Gave me a .25 oz sample size and charged me $5 for it.  Thanks!

My skin DID look pretty good.  and the next day it was tight and dry.  But i never peeled.  and that $5 lotion?  Instead of peel, I broke out like a mo fo.  No nice skin a week later, no reduction in scars or age spots, nadda.

I was going to give them a 2nd chance, but after writing all this, I realized what a crappy experience it was and I went ahead and cancelled that 2nd appointment.  I'm going to try a dermalogist instead."
Negative	While being processed here I had to sit in a chair for over 24 hours being sleep deprived. It shouldn't take that long to process an inmate. And they once tried to tell me I couldn't use two debt cards to post bail...I had to use one. You have a right to bail, nothing in law says you can only use 1 payment method! Please train your staff and update them in accordance with the right to bail. Oh, and to charge me twice with prostitute, lol. Ya, I beat both cases. Total corruption!
Negative	"A friend was itching for some Italian food last weekend and wanted to try some place different so we looked on Yelp and saw the good reviews for this place. They offer gluten free pasta so I was game. I ordered the Tuscan pasta dish with spinach, artichokes and feta cheese, along the GF noodles. It didn't taste like there was any sauce on it, just the veggies and cheese. I added pepper and salt, but it was still a bit lacking. My friend got their spaghetti with meatballs and an order of garlic bread. I have to say that it was disappointing to me that, like so many other restaurants that offer a GF pasta noodle, they did not go the extra mile to offer a gluten free garlic bread is beyond me. Garlic bread and pasta go together like Forrest and Jenny! Aaand no GF dessert either. 
This is why they garner 2 stars and a big Meh from me."
Negative	There is something wrong with this Dominos location. Sometimes they don't answer the phone at all that even the other dominoes close by told me that they hear that from customers a lot. I ordered their gluten free pizza and the guy on the phone just said thank you and was about to hang up. I asked him if he knew where he was going to send it and he then confirmed the address but did not tell me my order back to me. It wasn't gluten free when it was delivered and when I called they would not answer the phone. This place is awful.
Negative	I've been there several times and the young woman who gave me a pedicure was really good. However the last time I went, the shop was generally messy, so I looked closer. There was a lot of accumulated dirt and dust behind the spa chairs. Cleanliness is very important to me especially with any kind of body work, so I won't go back there.
Negative	I agree with the review below that this place has gone downhill. It was decent before, though not that memorable or special by any means. I ordered a basic pho tai nam and the broth was fatty but bland, no sign of anise which is a critical ingredient and a smell that is quintessential to the flavor of a good bowl of pho. They also gave us wilted basil so I asked for another and they charged me a dollar. The wait staff was obviously overworked and even though they asked the courteous 'are you finished', they grabbed my boyfriend's bowl before he was through. He still was chewing...big clue guys! Definitely will be going elsewhere. For the first time, I felt unsatisfied after eating a bowl of pho.
Negative	"The ONLY reason I am giving the bar 2 stars is because of the band. We stopped in to listen to Roxie Gunn Project and sat at one of the sofas with a table. It wasn't very comfortable but we didn't mind. After waiting 10- 15 minutes my husband went up to the bar to get us drinks. The cocktail waitress was walking around, stopping to chat with 2 guys any time she walked by them. There were many tables with drinks covering them and she was making no effort to clear tables or wait on the people with empties. She would walk right by. We were at the our seats for 2 hours and not once did she stop to check on us. 
The drinks that my husband went to the bar to get were ok but you can't screw up beer. My mixed drink was ok, not too strong not too weak."
Negative	"I'm not quite sure why people love this place. Food is pretty expensive, but at least it tastes fine.  

Probably the worst part of the meal came because we tried to get there early.  It was almost 95+ degrees in dry Las Vegas at 11:15 AM, but the misting fans that were on the outside patio didn't come on till noon.   Really guys?  You don't have control over your own fans?  Take them off the timer, seriously...

At least the servers were on top of refilling water, but that's only because we were dying on the patio during the summer time heat.

Maybe just come for dessert?  Chances are you'll be drunk and won't want to walk to Caesar's Palace though...

Might as well skip it, and just lie to your friends who didn't Vegas with you (and say it was whatever)."
Negative	Any restaurant that scores a D from the County Health department is disgusting.  Even more disgusting is this place is supposed to be upscale. Unfortunately their prices exceed their cleanliness.
Negative	"I found this place on Yelp, I saw there was a bakery and wanted to try it out the food and see what they have. Walked in with my fiancé, no one was there at the counter. We waited probably a few minutes for some one to come and greet us. The place looked nice and clean. The food was eh okay, we spent $17 for two sandwiches with a combo. I got a lamb sandwich and he got a gyro. He got his plain with just meat. Mine tasted like it had mayo, I honestly was expecting like that Mediterranean yogurt sauce (jajik). After eating I tried a sample of their Turkish delight and it was really good. So I asked to buy a piece. The guy at the counter got my piece and said it'll be $1.50 so I pulled out my card and he asked if I had cash? I looked through for cash and didn't have any. So he literally opened his drawer and went through all the credit receipts and found mine that I used to pay for the food, and made me write $1.50 tip on the receipts. Like are you really that cheap with the credit card fees? I didn't see a sign or anything that said there's a minimum amount to spend in order to use your credit card. I asked him THREE times on why he wants me to that. Because I was honestly confused at first. 

Honestly It just felt really awkward. Not a warm feeling. Maybe I have high expectations in customer service. But for a place that claims to have new management, it just seemed like they didn't care. I was really interested in buying their bread too, I tried making conversation asking about the bread and guy was just like ""it's $6"" just really blunt as if he didn't want me to be there. I felt as if I was bothering him being at his restaurant. 

I was really excited at first to find a place with a nice bakery, to buy bread. I'm Turkish, and we make a lot of Turkish food that goes with those style bread, and it's hard to find fresh bread. The place I usually go is downtown Phx and its quiet a drive. But if this is the customer service  they have, I'll stick to my original place."
Negative	"The gym is awesome, kept clean, I like how small and personal it is. It's convenient and isn't bad on pricing . But everytime I walk in, the staff never has a smile on their face , their intimidating. I don't find you better in anyway , I'm coming to YOUR gym to feel better about myself when I can clearly go somewhere else, which is what I'm doing now. I could only imagine being an overweight person, if you make me feel uncomfortable, I'd feel bad for others who are really trying to make a difference in their life . *note their are a ""couple"" staff members who actually act like they care. You're a business and a business who is suppose to make a difference , start doing it ."
Negative	Leaving for vaca soon and just got a shellac manicure and regular pedicure. I selected a coral color for my shellac nails and asked the technician to paint my toes in a similar regular polish color. The lighting is so bad at the back I didn't realize how off the colors were until I was outside. My toes are hot pink! This is not the 1st time this salon has burned me like this - you think I would have learned. Now I have to go paint them myself, what a waste. Total damage was $75. When I came back in to point this out to her she just keep saying my hands were lighter - yes I know this is why I'm annoyed. I looked at the polish wall and found 2 coral colors that would have worked. She didn't bother to look in the beginning.  Ugh.  Lesson, don't let them match your colors - pick your own or a different salon that pays attention.
Negative	The emergency room can't find a shattered heel bone with X-rays.  Suffered with it for awhile until I received better care from Banner Estrella.   Don't go here for suspected bone injuries.
Negative	"Lunch for two on a Tuesday. Not too busy. 5 tables out of maybe 20?

Located in the basement. Nice and spacious, and looked pretty clean for a restaurant in chinatown. Did not check the washroom facilities however. Will remember in the future.

Offers flat chopsticks that you usually find in korean restaurants here, but wooden disposable ones are available by request if that is your thing. Other tableware includes spoons and napkins at arms-length. A bottle of water provided for easy-access self-serve.

Menu comes with a lot of options.

Five side-dishes were offered, though from other pictures it looks like they offer random options, so YMMV.

Ordered the stone bowl bibimbap with bulgogi (#82). Size wasn't too bad. The meat looked kind of like ground beef with sesame sprinkled on top but perhaps they just decided to chop it up into small bite-sized pieces so that it is easier to eat. No visible sauces were added and all of the vegetables were nice and dry, with a small egg on top. I'm left wondering if I was not eating it the proper way.

Came to $13.50 after tax.
Minimum $20 for credit card.

Definitely like the way they've worked out their prices when it comes to rounding however.
Experience wasn't that great for the first time, but perhaps it's just what I ordered."
Negative	"Was excited to try this place with my boyfriend. The pizza was good, but nothing special at all. But there customer service is something else...

We ate in, and they forgot to give us straws so I walked up to where they usually have them by the machines and noticed there weren't any in there either. So I walk up to the counter so I can ask, and notice some employees just look at me then continue going to the back... like all I needed was a straw. One of the girls finally came, said nothing, reached down to grab the straws under her, walked past me(when she could've easily just handed me one lol) stocked them and left, no word. Hmm ok thanks. Anywho.

We also only ordered one pizza, and ended up waiting probably 30 minutes for a regular, schmegular, pepporoni pizza. It was not packed at all by the way. They finally give us our pizza and we start eating. The reason it took so long is because they gave our pizza to a different customer. We were eating that customers pizza 5 slices in and the girl comes up to us really confused and was seriously explaining the issue for a good 5 minutes there. Like girl, we're already eating it what did you want us to do... making it look like it was our fault. He just needed a Large that's all. Super awkward interaction. Mediocre pizza."
Negative	My dealings with PO's over a bunch of years fall into 2 categories - very positive or very negative.  The BC PO is one of the worst.  It really should not be this way, as long wait times are not an issue.  The issue is a human one - sorry attitudes from counter help to whoever acting postmaster.  The management at the main PO at Sunset is aware of this PO 's sorry state, but nothing seems to change.
Negative	A busy place on the weekends and seats are very close to the other tables. Didn't get my right order from the server and had to stand in big line to pay for my bill. Bagels are delicious but this place is too pricey.
Negative	From the moment we were seated began the horrible experience. Took 10 minutes and me asking the manager if we even had a server to get our drinks ordered. After that, we ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time. Our food came out and by the time we were finished and ready for the check the appetizer still had not come out. We told them not to even bother with it at this point. $50 meal that was not anywhere near worth that price. The experience was really bad even though the food did taste good. Won't be coming back anytime soon.
Negative	I had the worst experience. My crab cake was good BUT, it had huge pieces of crab shell in it and it almost chipped my tooth and I don't mean a little piece of shell because that is understandable but I could tell you exactly where the piece of hard shell came from(claws, legs, and it body..and it wasn't a leg shell). I did takeout and it took an hour just to get my food and I was hoping that well hopefully I will have a great experience with the food...NO NO NO I ordered the blackened catfish Po'Boy as well and my fries were burnt, very flimsy no crispness, and they weren't hot. Oh I did have one crisp fry that wasn't burnt...Like the fries were fried this morning and been sitting there all day and they mixed in a fresh batch just to make it seem like they were just fried or they recooked them. Then my Po'Boy uhhh where do I start!!! The fish was very bland and I don't understand how it can be bland and it's blackened. It definitely needed salt for taste. Waaaay to much mayo and the tartar sauce tasted like unflavored mayo. So in my mouth I just taste a bunch of oily based spread. The bread was stale so when I bit into it..well I tried to. The whole inside slipped out and I was left with still trying to tear a bite off the bread. Overall I give it a BIG ZERO. That's why either Guy Fieri only talked about the Beef Debris Po'Boy because everything else was nasty or they allowed for the recognition to go to their head and now they don't care about the food quality...and I'm guessing the second part is right because I had autographs on both of my takeout containers and I didn't even ask for it. Thank you LOLA'S for the horrible experience I will never come back.
Negative	Ok so made a 1030 appointment for an oil change been here over and hour still waiting to get out of here look to see mechanic working on 2 cars really? Can't get an oil change done within 30 minutes? Agin I tried this place and it is such a rip off and scam looking at my bill you can see labor charge over $500 parts almost $500 none of it adds up oh yeah shop supply $25 I wanted a brake job rotors and calipers the pads are free and try to make sense of it it's really a joke I tried talking to manager he made no sense as well as the service advisors this place is a rip off stay away I went to another shop on Silverado it cost me $645 for the entire job it was a firestone as well makes no sense!!
Negative	"We saw the newly opened Laotian place and were excited to try it.  However, the experience was sorely lacking.  The food was mediocre for the area, there are comparable places serving southeast Asia food.  But the main complaint is the hidden ""admin"" fee to use your credit card.   This was not reflect on the menu nor was I informed about it before getting my card swiped.  The aggravating part is that when I asked the waitress about it, she passed it off as the norm here like I've been living in some other world my whole life.  I can understand if there's a minimum limit to charge my card without a fee, but we spent nearly 40 bucks.  Furthermore, after reading about Visa credit card surcharge policy, venders are not allowed to charge a surcharge unless you are paying the government and the surcharge must be a flat fee, not the 4% that sticky rice tries to pass off to the consumer.  This is not the right business model, either increase ur price to reflect the proper cost, or just man up and say this is how cheap we are.  Asian food is not lacking in Chambana and there is no reason to put up with this."
Negative	"I moved here 5 months ago, never had issue with package delivery as here.
First they push you to sign up for locker, than when I did, doesn't work, so, I have go to post office to pick up order for 6 dollars. 
They told me how they can't help. I never saw that your packege can't be delivered without lockers. I would like to ask Managment how they can't help with that, What they can do??.. they decided to put lockers.. with story how will be much better and easier for residents. 
What is easy? Go to post office for one herbal tea?"
Negative	"Please check your takeout order before you leave.
What a disappointment we ordered the chicken kabob plate with a side of soup and when I pickup I checked he had a salad in the house place of soup and beef kabob for chicken kabob. The rice was stale and dry what a Waste of time and money. The And the people are not that friendly too looks like a wrong choice will never be going back their again."
Negative	"This review is for the minute clinic-
Do not come here!! Go somewhere, anywhere else.
I caught the flu so I checked online to see there was no wait time at this location. Checked in and the computer said it would be a 10-15 minute wait. No problem... Well after 30 minutes, some lady calls me up front to tell me they cant see me because they close at 5:30 and the doctor will not stay past closing. So frustrating. I ended up going to UMC instead."
Negative	Horrible service. Ordered online and received a email confirmation for delivery. And never received order after two hours. When I called the owner tried to tell me it was for pick up they didn't have my address. I told her I had an email confirmation saying it was for delivery And it included my delivery address, she said what are you calling me a liar. Very rude and unprofessional. I absolutely do not recommend this restaurant
Negative	We made appointments and still waited when we arrived because the receptionist told us they were 'all full'. What was the point of making an appointment? Technicians are very hit and miss (Amber, Nick and Mindy are great) but this time my technician was the owner (Candy?) and she stabbed me under my toe, didn't even buff my nails or cut my cuticles. The whole pedicure would've taken about 20 minutes if I didn't need to ask her to redo the polish because she only put about 3 sparkles on each toe and it looked awful. So she redid it and I still have polish on my cuticles and my skin. Some technicians here really couldn't care less about what their work looks like. Make sure you get the right one.
Negative	"I like Baja Fresh, just not this location.  I was walking through the Excalibur hotel looking for something quick to take back to my room to eat when I came across this place. The guy taking my order was not paying attention when I was placing my order. Even though I was the only one in line, he was busy doing other things as I was telling him what I wanted. Not surprisingly he got my order completely wrong. I had ordered a Burrito Mexicano, Enchilado Style. He tried to give me a regular Baja Burrito. As I was explaining to him, and the lady at the counter, what I wanted he walked away again. I was then not surprised when he took that Baja Burrito and threw it in the oven with some salsa and chips to make it Enchilado Style. I flagged the guy down and let him know that it was not what I wanted. I wanted a Burrito Mexicano! He seemed annoyed by me, and I was definitely annoyed that he couldn't stand still for long enough to take my order correctly. It took awhile, but I was able to finally get my order right in the end. 

I should have known better than to go to a place like Baja Fresh in Las Vegas when there are so many other unique options available. Service can really kill an appetite, and my experience at this Baja Fresh made me lose mine."
Negative	Great entertainment! Howie and Paul are the best in Las Vegas. The problem is the service sucks. To start I ordered a glass of wine and the waitress tossed it in the middle of the table and walked away. It wasn't even in a wine glass. She was very rude. We also had to call to make sure who was playing because management keeps switching the night for entertainment.
Negative	"I understand why they have 1-star. I'm following suit. Not only are they charging me a $100 late fee because they shipped the equipment to the wrong address, JILL at this location would not own up to the mistake. No apologies were given, no eye contact... she said the same to me four times, ""we don't give credit in the store, you need to call customer service... I can't help you in the store"". And I responded, ""so what can you do?"" And she said ""I can't have credit in the store, here is your receipt."" ABSOLUTE CRAP. Never again. Account closed for good, pay the extra $20 and go with COX."
Negative	My husband and I went in to buy 5 polo shirts for a family photo.  Five employees stood  6 feet away, in a circle talking and watching us try to pull shirts out of bottom shelf cubbies to check sizes. We were struggling because my left arm is in a cast. Finally I walked over , thanked them for not helping us and went to Nordstrom and bought the same shirts! Someone needs to train these people.
Negative	"I'm a local and I went to zingers thinking that it would be a quick, yummy place to get lunch. Oh man, was I wrong. None of the servers would talk to me, even though it wasn't that busy. Then, one of the ladies took my order and told me it would take 5 minutes. I had to use the restroom, so I went there and returned 10 minutes later. My food still wasn't ready. Then she was extremely rude telling me that my food wouldn't be ready for a while, in a super condescending tone. I asked her if I could at least get my drink that she failed to give me at the time of my transaction and she went off and did other things, then put the drink on the counter, not even bothering to get my attention. Long story short, rude service and TERRIBLE, OVERPRICED FOOD (McDonalds has better burgers, for HALF the price. AND their ""world famous chili fries"" were atrocious). I will NEVER eat here again. TOURISTS: there are WAYYYYY better places to get delicious food for the same price! Don't waste your time on this dump!"
Negative	Might have been an acquired taste but my taste buds weren't happy. The food made me feel horrible. I was sluggish for the remainder of the day and just wanted that food out of me.
Negative	"I frequently eat at and take out from this location however I don't know if they changed ownership.
Because I had the sushi and was extremely disappointed.
The rolls were all rice as was the sushi. The fish was sliced so thin that it was transparent and I could barely taste it. The dragon roll was all cucumber with a little eel skin inside. I am embarrassed that I paid for it. I never write reviews, however I was so disappointed that I felt compelled to do so now. It was a disgrace to pas for a bunch of rice with a hint of fish."
Negative	i come to this circle k quite a lot as i work right next door with GCU. I come to this location when me and my co workers take our 15 min break. I was told today that i am not allowed to purchase powerball tickets since my co workers don't carry their IDs with them. I have my ID and we are all in our 30s. The circle k staff are familiar with us as we come frequently and i buy the tickets once a week. I do not recommend this location and i will likely walk to the QT across the street in the future.
Negative	"Update:
Giving one more star as someone (they didn't identify their position) from Ocotillo responded to my review right way. They addressed the menu changes (I certainly understand that restaurants do this) and photos, and that I did have prosciutto, they cut it to resemble bacon. What they didn't address was the long wait for our meal and that it wasn't hot. Also that grilled bread is a personal like/dislike and sorry that I didn't enjoy it. Well I've had grilled bread before and I do like it, but not cold!
They invited me to come back to get a better impression of the restaurant. Thank you for your offer, but my husband and I will pass."
Negative	Most dishes I have tried so far, has been dry and with low quality. The staff are not friendly either. Growing up with good quality Persian food I would not recommend  this to anyone especially of you are trying to give the first taste of Persian food to someone you care about.
Negative	Bought a used car here from Mark and he didn't mention to tell me that one of the windshield wipers were broken and CD player was broken. After a week of purchasing the car I got a flat tire and the spare they gave me was flat also. But I guess this is all my fault because it was my first car. I just think they took advantage of that. But hey, thanks for selling me a car that I have to take to the shop every month... You guys are so great!
Negative	"Put my suit in to be dry cleaned on Tuesday. It had gum on the bottom of the suit jacket that I pointed out to the person at the front counter. They asked if I could wait until the following Monday to have it returned. 

I thought the wait was a little long, but I guess they needed that long to get it out. Most other dry cleaners would have it back to me within two days. 

Poor marks for service...

I went in to pick it up. I paid the attendant, then looked over the suit to find the stain had NOT been completely removed. The attendant scratched the area to see if it was permanent, but the stain was still removable.

They put the suit back in to be cleaned... AGAIN, and now I have to wait until tomorrow to see if they can finally clean my suit. They gave me a lint roller for my inconvenience. 

If they can't seem to clean the suit, maybe they want me to see if I can clean it myself with the lint roller.... and why was I charged full price? No discount available?

Poor marks for quality....

The front counter attended was very nice and helpful, but I think I might try another dry cleaners... I would recommend you do the same, since service and quality at this business is 'spotty' at best (pun intended)."
Negative	Just because you work with dogs doesn't mean you have to have atrocious customer service. I took my dog there to be groomed at 9am which they said it would be about 3 hours until he's ready and they'd call me when he's done. I didn't get a call until almost 5 hours later that he was ready to be picked up. By this time I was attending my child's graduation which lasted barely an hour. Within this time I got multiple calls and an unprofessional voicemail stating that my dog has been ready for over an hour and needs to be picked up because they're done for the day. Mind you they don't even close until 4pm and it was barely 3pm. First, you keep my dog for hours and then basically harass me when it's unconvenient for you? And then on top of that, my dog's haircut was terribly choppy. I will most definitely not be returning for obvious reasons. Thanks for a horrible experience.
Negative	"Never get help from Kenn Jester! I bought what he told me off the website to get told I bought the wrong stuff and it would cost me $500 more plus what I had already spent $322. Just for the remote start. I will not be having the remote start installed by them. All they could say is ""I can have a talk with him."" WTH Clearly he doesn't belong this that department."
Negative	"Service was great, but didn't enjoy my tonkotsu miso soup at all. We also ordered the shrimp tempura and that too didn't taste like any shrimp tempura we've had. 

I would highly recommend going to jenya or Sapporo instead for great ramen."
Negative	Accidentally ran into this one after visiting the Botanical Garden today. Ordered a beef kimchi toufu which was horrible-beef must be old and had a bite that actually tasted rotten. Rice must be left over from last night with chunks in the bowl.
Negative	I've been going to this bake shop for a year and really like their stuff. Suddenly very recently their baked goods are not very good. I got a cheese bread and it was so stale and not very fresh. Same with cinnamon buns that we got same day it was hard, stale and the next day my husband and I got a diarrhea (it was the only same food we ate all day so we figured it's from the cinnamon bun). It's so sad, I would come here every week but now I'm not sure if I'm coming back. It's not a good quality anymore.
Negative	"This place is the TGI Fridays of cajun food. Don't go here if you have a taste for cajun food, or creole food, or anything even remotely similar. If your idea of excitement is ordering something other than your 'usual' at Fridays or Applebees, this place will be perfect. Otherwise, it will bore and probably disappoint you. My shrimp po' boy was basically a fried shrimp, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, meaning it had almost nothing in common with an actual po' boy - and the hoagie bun was stale at that.

Don't go here looking for classic New Orleans drinks either. Their mixed drink menu contains exactly five items, and while the full bar might tempt you to order something else, when I tried, the terribly overworked waitress asked more than once if the drink I wanted was ""on the menu"" before I gave up and ordered one of the fairly tasty but overpriced Dixie Black Lager. If the lower octane stuff doesn't suit you (and you're willing to stick to the menu), be sure to note their signature ""blue"" martini - (you'd be hard not to, as they take every opportunity to push it). This drink deserves a special mention. Why is ""blue"" in quotes you might ask? Well, I don't know - it certainly is blue. Maybe they migrated over from the word ""martini"" because I can't think of a drink farther away from a martini than this coconut rum, blue curacao and pineapple monstrosity.

The bottom line: skip this place and stumble just a few feet further to E. 4th where you'll find a whole host of great, unique Cleveland restaurants much worthier of your patronage."
Negative	Eh. It's okay. Food is good and so is the customer service but I honestly wouldn't eat in here again. Lots of ghetto people. I get it, it's busy, but dude, this is like ultra ghetto scum in here. Tables were sticky. Bathrooms dirty. Yeah. There isn't much space inside to begin with so just use the drive through.
Negative	I went to table ten with high expectations. We ordered their sampler the best part of the meal was the desert and even that was not that good. We also had wine that was twenty six or twenty eight dollars extra the wine was very vinagary. The whole meal was a big disapointment. The server we had had no personality at all he did his job but that was about all. I would not recommend this restaurant don't waste your time or your money.
Negative	Was told by a few friends this vet will do payment plans... One of my feral colony kitties was attacked by someone or something and was gone for 4 days. Came home with hole in the side of her face, tooth hanging and major infection.. When i went to the vet they said they only do payments on emergency surgery animals and determined my baby wasn't an emergent candidate.. WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER!! DIDNT EVEN TAKE HER OUT OF HER CRATE!!!!! They said it was an abscess and gave me the name of another vet.. Please see the review for Madison Animal Hopsital
Negative	"Ate here in June for a Friday Fish Fry with my 11 year old daughter. The place is under new ownership, was previously named Nelson's Crossing.

I was greeted by a familiar face behind the bar as I entered, so my hopes for a good meal elevated immediately. I was subsequently told by our waitress that the former Nelson's Crossing cook was retained...which also got me thinking that I was in luck. 

No Such Luck!

Not sure what happened with the cook's attention to quality, but it has suffered for sure. I always loved the cod dinner with hash browns; adding cheese and onions to that made it the star attraction on the plate and is what really brought me back. What I got though resembled reheated via microwave mush that had a powdery consistency of improperly prepared Kraft macaroni and cheese. Not sure why you would cook hash browns in a microwave...or not use real cheddar cheese...no love!

The fish (cod) was overcooked and tough. Flavor was ok but hard to get past the fact that you had to chew forever just to be able to swallow the bite.

Service was not the priority of the waitstaff. No smiles, many half-hearted apologies including those offered to the couple seated well ahead of us that received their meal as we were half way through ours. 

Hint to owners...if your friends and family are serving for you but are  ruining your business because of their lack of personality and focus on customer service, get people in there who will or you will soon not have to worry about customers at all!

I so wanted to love my meal and have a place near Marshall for a decent fish fry...I am so hoping that some changes are made so that I can give JD & Me another try. 

If you do go, please add a review and let Marshall know if it is worth another trip!"
Negative	"Service was good and appetizer ,Caprese,was good !!so thought we were off to good start. And the Venetian is a very cool place to hang.

Husbands Ravolis were ok and overpriced of course (it's vegas!$$$$$)
My dish was interesting,Rigatoni Allan Napolitana...kept having flashbacks to my husband's Irish Lamb stew he made for St. Patty.  
Wasn't a fan of the dish at all.   

If a well known chef star has his name tied to something I'd hope it would be good ?!
Overall been sorely disappointed with the nicer dinning places in Vegas.  From now on think we'll stick to the lower priced options, pubs, bar food etc."
Negative	I usually go to Midway Chevy for all devices on my car, however I decided to give Autonation Chevrolet Arrowhead a chance since it is closer to me. Today is the first and last time. I arrived and asked the person who greeted me if they accept competitors coupons and was told yes they did.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a service rep I was told by this service rep that they don't accept competitors coupons and that it would be $12 more than what the competitor would have charged. Midway chevy does accept competitors coupons without any question. It isn't like I was using the $12 coupon from Big O tires. It was from a local Chevrolet dealership.  She asked who told me and then asked the kid who did and told him he was wrong and shouldn't be saying it. If I had known I would have either gone someplace else or gone back to midway Chevy. Be warned.. They will tell you yes until it comes time for them to take the car,  then tell you know and charge you more. I will not come back to this dealership in the future,  for service and definitely will not buy from them if this is the way they treat their customers.
Negative	I will not be back to this location! This was my first time here and I ordered take out and because it was over $50 they took my card number in case I didn't pick up the food. I went in and paid cash but they still charged my card and now I have to wait forever just to get refunded this is bullshit and will probably will happen to other people to!
Negative	"I came in with a last-minute print job that I needed right away for a presentation.  Since they have an ""instant"" print center, I just figured they could...you know...print instantly.  I was told they couldn't start my job for ""at least"" three hours, maybe more.  I tried to explain my urgency and the ""instant"" part of their name, but the counter person truly did not care whatsoever.

On the office supply said they are alright, but sometimes out of stock on just basic things you need.  If you need help or have a question, good luck finding someone!"
Negative	"No stars. I had the worst experience ever at this so called ""fine jeweler"" their product is crap, and their service is even worse. A necklace purchased 14 months ago from them is now ruined, by them (during my 6 month warranty inspection/ cleaning) and they refused to do anything...other than suggest I but a new one (not exchange), or spend more money on sending it in only to be lost or ruined, again. I probably would have had better luck at some really really crappy and cheap place, like Claire's boutique where I know the jewelry is cheap. Next time, I'll be taking my business to Jared"
Negative	Strolled in here with a buddy one night after work in search of some mouthwatering burgers as depicted through pictures. Instead we were thoroughly disappointed. For what is supposed to be a somewhat quick in and out burger joint we waited 20 minutes for my friends burger to come out. That being said he was finished with his by the time mine was placed In front of me. They even forgot we ordered milkshakes and that just took even longer. Food was okay but still left hungry. For the style of the place you are way better off heading over to five guys. Prices are extremely high for what you get.
Negative	"Absolutely greasy! 
Go back to the basics of BBQ.
Lost for words....that's hard for an establishment to make me feel this way. The ribs were smoked at one time. Then they were heated back up in a deep fryer. Very gross lemons at the counter. I  went to get some lemon wedges to find that the lemons were slimy and sticky. The dining  room was dirty. The people who waited on you were very loud and unprofessional. The person in the background cooking yelled out ""get me a drink, I'm dehydrated and dying back here "".  Mayonnaise based coleslaw and Velveeta mac and cheese. 3 people at the counter and they looked terribly bored counted money over and over...instead of cleaning or asking if everything is good? 
THIS IS TO THE OWNERS... SINKING BUSINESS, LOOK INTO YOUR HARD WORK FROM THE PAST AND SEE IF THESE PEOPLE CARE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR LIVELIHOOD. I LOOKED AROUND AND SAW THE OTHER PEOPLES REACTIONS.  THIS IS WHY YOUR SALES ARE DOWN AT THIS LOCATION."
Negative	"We were very excited about this restaurant opening. We visited for lunch on a slow Sunday afternoon. There was no one in front of us when we ordered yet it took over 25 minutes to receive our sandwiches. It then took another 15 minutes before our fries came out. 

Very unimpressed with the food. Small portions with unremarkable flavors. And there was no manager around for us to speak with. 

I will not be returning to this location"
Negative	Mom and pop has made egregious errors that can't be overlooked anymore. I'm not trying to be malicious, I only hope to change them and the way they treat customers. I've looked past failed health violations before because they were mom and pop starting out, they didn't know any better. I should have questioned them further when they only changed their practice of keeping food warm to pass the inspection, only to revert back to how they failed the first place. This last visit charging my friend $1 for tap water was the final straw. The service and food is simply not worth it for a return anymore.
Negative	Terrible experience! If you care about workers at all please don't go to Bondurant.  Saw workers who don't care about safety or quality at all.  Flat tires, bad brakes, broken seats, junk in the car, all a daily occurrence here. A $5000 course here doesn't mean you end up with the best training in the world- you just get the biggest headache and an empty wallet.  Try training at Miller Raceway Park, Laguna Seca, etc.. Get your money's worth by learning from a school who actually cares about the people working there, and those coming in the door. No joke.
Negative	"We came in to our parents ""favourite"" restaurant expecting the same usual taste but left with a rather bad taste. The food just wasn't the same. My parents noticed right away and were turned off. The flavours, textures and abundance of spices were just off. The service of the Dosa and anything behind the counter was slow and we had to ask several times for assistance. Everything from the buffet line up to desserts has changed for the worst. They even took out the chocolate fountain. 
Definitely new chefs and management/owners that are cutting corners and trying to make another dime. So sad to see one of the most popular places in GTA fizzle out."
Negative	"I bought out my leased car in December.

Since then, I have been getting multiple daily calls from the 'warranty service department' trying to get me to buy an extended warranty.

So either Toyota or Findlay sold my information.

Buyer beware!"
Negative	"I came from New York and my husband told me this place has great food. We were seated for 15 min without anyone serving us. I asked on waitress if we could order, and she replied with anger ""no! Because I'm busy with other people!"" She came back later and told us there were more tables in front of us and if we didn't want to wait it's whatever. Thanks god that I knew people in Pittsburgh are mostly very nice otherwise it will make very bad impression to people who travel here. Also, i seriously doubt if she is racist because we are Asian."
Negative	"Decided to try the new Club Cafe after it reopened following renovations which basically appears to be just new paint, flooring and some additions of some wall decor that looks straight from Big Lots. 

The menu is varied with a few new items. Mainly sandwiches, burgers, and a few entrees.  

The waiter reeked of cigarettes which made me lose my appetite and question if he even washed his hands. 

Food was barely warm which was even more unacceptable given it was slow (230pm).

Doubt I'll ever be back. The whole place is smokey as it is and I think every employee there are 3-pack/day smokers."
Negative	I give this restaurant 2.5 stars. This was my first time going to hooters. I came in with my boyfriend and his best friend. During the entire 4 hours we were there, the waitress constantly kept giving refills to my boyfriend and his friend, but did not give me a refill. I was offended because I felt like they were being very disrespectful. I don't know if they were trying to be more flirtatious or thought that they was going to get a better tip from the guys. But I think it's wrong that the entire time I was drinking from the same drink. Only reason I was able to get a refill is because my boyfriend gave me his. Shortly after he gave me his, the waitress gave him another. I would not be coming back here again. The food was alright, but I will say I like the fact that it wasn't too crowded.
Negative	Was very unimpressed with this place. They kept switching doctors on me which I didn't like. I was also have problems with ear infections and they put me on antibiotics that didn't work, so I had to keep coming back. I was put on different antibiotics which also didn't work. Finally they referred me to an ENT.
Negative	"The first time I went here, I waited almost 2 hours to be seen, but they did really good work on my pedicure. I have to say that the last few times I've been, I haven't really felt welcome, if that makes sense.
I can't put my finger on it, but I just didn't enjoy my visit. Also, it hasn't mattered if I got the deluxe or regular pedicure (a difference of 10 dollars,) I always left wondering what the girl next to me paid to get a really enjoyable foot massage, extra time taken with foot filing (dead skin removal,) and nice conversation, because no matter what, mine came with none of that. They do an ok job, but I can get the same results at home and save my money for other things."
Negative	I would of rather went to McDonalds.  Poor selection, the meat carver cut portions so thin had to make several trips.   I would recommend not wasting your money.  Breakfast no better juice machine out no one filling them there are five them go figure.  No coffee cups you think that is something you would want to keep up with.
Negative	This is the worst restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale. Ordered the jalapeño crudo and the fish looked and tasted very old with a brownish color on it. The soft shell crab bun also tasted very greasy and fishy. The only edible thing was our sushi roll which was just ok.
Negative	"Hated our visit today. We been here several times and it's one of our family's favorite. This is way we decided to make reservations and bring our guest from out of town to one of our regular spots. 
However, I am not sure if they got new management or was sold, but this afternoon we waited over 45 minutes, from ordering, for a little over 1/2 of our food. The other orders came out 10 minutes later. The wait staff and manager appeared to be clueless in the food they serve and never apologized for the extremely long wait. The manager did apologize for not ordering enough food because of the holiday, but today is Saturday afternoon! 
I got a black bean burger salad which sounds good, but was not. Everyone else stated the food was okay, due to the super annoying hour leading up to eating."
Negative	"Judgemental @ssholes!!!!!

I went to Grace O'Malley's tonight. I had one drink, and knowing I reached my limit, was at the bar drinking water, conversing with my friend. 

Before I could argue, I was then escorted out of the facility. When I asked why I I was being escorted out, staff answered ""because I was intoxicated"". I agreed that I had enough to drink, and stopped over an hour ago. I knew I had not been violent, aggressive, or vulgar in language or behaviour during my stay. I had already stopped consuming alcohol over an hour ago. When I asked why I was being escorted out, the staff simply stated that all they could do was retrieve my coat from coatcheck. but I was not permitted back into the facility. I was never offered an opportunity to defend my position. My opinion was simply dismissed by staff. I was dismissed based on a presumed outcome and behaviour, but not one that actually occurred.

I was unfairly judged by staff at Grace O'Malley's Do not go to this establishment!!"
Negative	"I went to the museum today which by the way was free so that was great! However, the workers were extremely rude. One of my friends daughter, a year old with active ADHD touched a painting and the worker touched her, cornered her and yelled at her to never touch the painting again. She felt super uneasy and scared as the mom took her away. We understand you can't touch the paintings but he did not have to aggressively address her. As for me, I had a backpack on which I found out when I came in, are prohibited. You may only wear it on one shoulder though, so I did. At one point, I forgot about the rule and had both straps on my shoulders which the same worker than told every other worker about through a radio/headset. He went up to me and told me to take it off and I quickly apologized and did so. I thought I was fine, you know, just a simple mistake..brain fart, whatever you want to call it so I just continued to walk around the museum in awe with the paintings UNTIL I realized that every single worker was watching my every move. It turns out the worker who told me to take off my backpack warned all the other workers to keep an eye on me, telling them what I had on and everything. My family confirmed this as they talked to him and he said I was ""on watch"" I felt insanely unsafe and uncomfortable throughout the rest of my time there with every eye of each worker watching me like I was some criminal over one small incident that wasn't even a big deal."
Negative	"I feel bad for the people who buy their dog food and don't look at the expiry date. I came in here after reading the first review, looking to buy a bag of Wellness Dog Food.

All the bags, 4lb, 6lb, 15lb, they were all Expired in Sept 2011.

And to top it off, they were selling at regular price. I'd understand if they sold it for $10/bag and stated the food was expired. But c'mon, don't trick the public. That's not operating in good faith. This behavior could make our beloved dogs sick!

In addition, after asking if they have anymore Wellness products, because the ones on the shelves are expired, they stated that they are discontinuing the Wellness products."
Negative	I have utilized the services of Somerset Landscape and I've found the services to be of sub standard quality. In the installation of my landscaping several steps were left out of the process leaving me with an incomplete job. The management was of no help in solving the many problems. I would not trust Somerset again.
Negative	Terrible I waited with my friend for 20 min. Could not even get a hello and we sat in the middle of the bar in front of 3 bartenders. Worst ever so we moved on. Over crowded and over rated. I would skip this stop.
Negative	"Been to this place a couple of times.     Used to be a Hooters.  Still kinda looks like one.  Not a bad thing.   Quite a few flat screens,  some farily nice size.  First time went with my son.  He ordered the steak (medium) with some fries.  Steak came well,  very dry, and fries were out of a bag, and not very fresh.   I had the pork chop with corn and roasted fries.  Pork chop was cooked perfectly,  and my fries were better than the ones my son had.   Son was only able to eat a few bites for his meal before he gave up.  After a bit of a wait,  someone came by to ask how the food was,  and I told him that the steak was over cooked.  His response was that it tasted good though,  and walked away.    Granted for $10 that is a very good price for a steak,  and if it was cooked right,  I would give this place an extra star.  But coupled with the bad fries made me not want to ever come back to this place again.

Well last night my gf wanted to try it and watch the game.  I decided to take her to see what she thought.   Service was better this time (no long waits between check ups).  I ordered the pot roast, with garlic mashed potatoes, and baked beans.  My gf ordered the appetizer sampler platter.    My pot roast was quite tender and tasty.  It could have used some slices of onion, carrot and celery to make it a little better.  Garlic mashed potatoes were also quite good,  but my baked beans were way too sweet.    My gf's appetizer platter had fried mozzerella sticks,  wings and nachos.  Everything on it was actually pretty good a well.  

So after a bad first visit, and a good 2nd,  I'm willing to give this place another chance.  

Sill have a problem with the fries and the steak from the 1st vist though.  Otherwise would've been 3 stars.  But the price is quite good otherwise."
Negative	"In Sept 2016 we started interviewing pool companies. We spoke to 5 companies including Presidential Pools. We selected companies well known in industry, referrals from friends and of course through yelp reviews. This was a very lengthy process as each company requires 3-4 hours over two separate appointments. With that said after 3 months we decided to go with Presidential Pools based on reliability of company, best warranty and finally our sales person Jeremy Hunt. Out of all the pool companies he was timely, answered all our questions (even the stupid ones) and most importantly we felt he was honest. I'll write more about the mishaps with the construction next but I still believe Jeremy was the best sales guy we meet with.

Alright everyone you speak to about building a pool warns you of the construction process and how it can be painful. For us we had that in mind so when the first few issues arose like the electrician showing up to lay wiring before the gas line was put in we simply called our project manager to let them know there was an issue and the electrician walked off the job since the gas wasn't laid. Then there was the issue with the pool equipment not being laid out according to plan but again it's already in so it probably doesn't really matter. We also had the steps in the pool put in not according to the plan and we were not informed of the change.

Then we had our paver coping installed which we questioned since it wasn't laid out to the pictures from the Presidential Pool website. We were told there was two ways to lay paver coping and they weren't aware of our choice however we were never asked before they laid them either. I also requested pictures of both options and was only given one picture of what we thought it should look like. Presidential Pools is correcting however the concern will remain if we lose any integrity of the paver as they now go and cut 1/8 between each paver to make space for the sand to correct the issue.

Next issue our spill way off our spa was not to plan and thus making it off center of the pool.  Again Presidential Pools is correcting by making the spill way wider. This issue will have to be seen if it doesn't create more issues in the future due to me requesting a wider spill way in the planning process and was told it wasn't a good idea for two reasons. First the pump wouldn't be able to get enough water over the wider area and second it would ultimately make the pump work harder to get the additional water over the spill way. 

We also encountered a grating issue in our backyard which I still believe is Presidential Pools fault. Our paver decking is higher than the rest of our patio. It is exactly 6 inches higher and potentially will be a tripping hazard. I understand we will have to work around this issue however Presidential Pools should have measured and at the very least given us a warning that this would be the case.

Lastly it's been exactly a year and we have 6 tiles around our pool that needed to be replaced due to cracking done by the contracted company ""Elite Landscaping"" and at this point I've been told by Presidential Pools they are trying to find the right color match to our tile but still it's been ONE year since they started building my pool. Just unacceptable!

Advise do not use or sign contract with Presidential Pools. Go with a company that will stick with the project until the very end."
Negative	Very disappointed in the service. If the employees don't want to be working until 10pm, then i suggest closing earlier or finding different employees. I approached the front at 9:30pm asking for a drink to-go, and the two employees chuckled as one rolled her eyes bc she had to get back up. Throughout my dinner i constantly had to get up and waive their attention since they hadn't checked up on us, or even asked for the order. There were only 3 tables seated at the time.
Negative	The rude service made me not want to eat anything at all. My boyfriend are while I just sat there with him. I've never been treated as terribly at a restaurant as I was here. It was my first time at any Greek restaurant and most definitely my last. We came in at 9. Tried ordering but was told they didn't have what we were planning to order. Had to look over the menu again and was rushed by our waitress because they close at 10. I will not suggest this place to anyone.
Negative	"I purchased a car from this location about 4 months ago for my little sister. It was the most horrible experience I have ever been through. Being in sales for the past 6 years I am very well versed in how a negotiation should go [this is not it]. My sister test drove the car with a sales associate with a sticker price of $13,400. We agreed with the sales associate that this was a fair price and begin the purchase. He then brought his manager over who told us that was the [BASE PRICE] of the model and that all the ""extras"" brought the real price up to $15,900. After laughing at him and threatening to walk out he caved and gave us the car at less than the original $13,400 price. If my little sister didn't love her Jetta I would have walked out hours ago. After that the rest of the process took 3.5 hours AND the next day we noticed the AIR CONDITIONER didn't work. We called the manager up and he offered to pay HALF. Being so sick of arguing and speaking with this company I just agreed. I will never purchase a VW again. Thank you Camelback VW."
Negative	"Maybe I've eaten at too many buffets in Vegas to notice... but I feel like The Wynn Buffet is not as good as they use to be. Yes, they have food... but the food selection is very limited and isn't that fresh. Their oysters dry, sushi, and pretty much everything are all VERY DRY since they have been sitting out. 
The only thing that I can honestly say tasted decent was the Congee and Gelato. Everything else was average. I would save my appetite next time and go to The Bacchanal at Cesar's Palace. It's worth the wait, experience, and money."
Negative	"Came here due to all the good reviews. Many reviews? Many good reviews? Why not? My boyfriend and I decided to come here to grab dinner. 

The wait was terrible. Although there were several open tables, we were stuck waiting. Service is terrible too. The sushi was terrible. It tasted like it has been out all day and no one wanted it. Overall, everything was terrible.

Food? 
It came out pretty fast... Like lightning fast. But I rather get struck by lightning than eat this lightning fast food. I was gagging due to the terrible taste of each roll. It tasted rotten and terrible. The spicy rolls tasted salty, sour and bitter at the same time. I did not even expect that to be possible. It did not taste spicy. It took all my strength to continue chewing. It took half a cup of water to down each roll. It got harder and harder as we went along. At first, I was wondering how I can get rid of the rolls without paying or eating them. But it got to the point where my boyfriend and I just had enough. I was willing to pay EXTRA to not have to finish the rolls. I didn't want them anywhere near me anymore. 

Cost?
Pretty cheap but for each roll you fail to eat, they'll charge you extra. Bail out on the rice? Charged for the rice you skipped over on. I'll accept the lost over the torture.

Service?
Waitress.. Are you even trying? I left the tip but it was more for the gentleman than you. 

TMI. Read if you are willing to. My boyfriend has terrible diarrhea from the food. After 3 times, he still isn't done. My stomach is uncomfortable and I feel like my food is about to come out of both ends. At least if I ever come back to Vegas, I know to never come back to this restaurants."
Negative	"I am soooo disappointed, and frankly dusillisioned.  I'm in the midst of a vacation and I had seen nothing but positives about this shop from the other Yelp reviews.  Based on the selection and variety I was going to rate this at least four stars.
Here's why I'm not.  I actually found several items to ask about, and was prepared to buy one or more of them.  The person at the desk, someone about my age or at least mid thirties, was talking to a friend who apparently comes in there a lot.  The clerk had said ""hi"" to me about 7 minutes into my visit, so he knew I was there.  I stood back a respectful distance so as not to intrude on their conversation more than was necessary, and tried to make eye contact.  I know he full on looked me in the eyes at least four times, but made no attempt to talk to me or ask if I wanted something.  After 23 minutes of this, the friend left, without buying anything I might add.  I should have left a long time ago but I was trying to give the clerk another chance.   Instead he left the desk area for the back, and peered out twice at me.  Finally, when he returned to hia counter I walked up to him and told himbrhat I don't know why he didn't want to sell anything yor me today, nor why he chose to ignore me for thirty minutes, but that he's lost a sale, as I was intending to buy today.   I'm still not sure why he treated me so rudely, but I did catch him saying ti his friend twice the word ""tourist"" in a derogatory way.  I don't know if that was about me in particular, but a specialty toy shop in Vegas should expect tourist customers.  I'd rather think that's the reason, beacuse otherwise my only other inference would be that me being overweigh and/or balding offended him, and that's too CRAPPY to think about.  I will still be in Vegas a few days, but I doubt that will make a difference if the owner reads this.  For all I know the clerk IS the owner.  But I do hope that this man feels remorse enough to never treat a potential customer that way EVER again."
Negative	"Usually great pizza. I'm not sure what happened. Ordered one tonight that was so salty that we threw it away. 

Maybe the owner should taste-test once in a while. 

We also ordered wings. For the first time, they were tough and chewy. 

Will probably give them one more chance before moving on to another pizza place. I will update the review then."
Negative	Damn it ever time I order online they fuck up my order. I don't know if anyone experiences this but it's getting really frustrating. Don't get me wrong they got good food. I wish this could get addressed.  Maybe it's just my luck or bad luck in this case.
Negative	If you want very expensive pizza ($14 for two slices) that are very doughy, tasteless sauce and boring cheese that isn't distributed evenly and not melted, this is the place!!!! I don't have high standards for airport food but this was insanely disappointing.
Negative	"I stopped by the Buck and Badger after work for a quick beer and an appetizer while waiting for friends.  Their beer selection was pretty good.  They had the beer that I prefer, so that was good.

But the reason for my review is the bartender was a bit of a dick.  He was wearing a cap bro-style (on backwards) and had this phony superior air about him.  It was off-putting.  Some people sat next to me and their first three beer requests the B & B did not have.  The bartender gave them some pretty strong 'tude and said ""You guys have to broaden your horizons.""  They handled it well but seemed slightly put off by it.

The menu options were limited and the prices pretty high.  They wanted $14 for their fish-fry special.  In Madison, a good fish-fry is usually $10.  

Overall not impressed."
Negative	"I took my daughter who was visiting from Colorado to this restaurant because I had been there before and I absolutely loved it! When we got there we were given no time to look at the menu,  there were three of us and we were given 1 menu! We hurried up and ordered since we felt pressured to hurry up. Our food arrived and we're given no plates to place our food on so we used the napkins that thank god were provided. We asked for plates and finally got some.  As the waiter cleared the table he spilled sauce all over me! I talked to the manager Tony and explained to him what had happened.  His response was ""ok I will ask my waiter to be more careful. ""  I was very disappointed that the manager was very nonchalant about my situation.  He made no effort to make this right. Very disappointed in them not valuing me as a customer."
Negative	Well where do I begin,came in for some food and drinks.Place seemed pretty upscale. Big wine menu, food menu sounded catchy.1st dish-Evgplant chips,drowned in greasy oil,sent it back after a few bites!2nd dish Poutine-ended having hair in it,sent it back and walked by the kitchen and both cooks have long beards which are NOT covered. 3rd dish Steak bites-drowned in oil, mushrooms were actually floating with oil. Ordered regular fries,how can someone screw that up....RIGHT....well,came out soggy due to drowned in grease as per last dishes. Manager stopped by and informed They will not charge us for the dish w a hair in it,hahaha, imagine if they did. Anyways, I'd look else where for a quick bite unless you just want WINE and some more WINE
Negative	"Overall okay experience, I ordered the Strawberry and Prosciutto Salad.  It was good, but nothing special and definitely not worth $13.

Once the waitress brought the salad I noticed there were no strawberries but pineapple instead.  The waitress didn't even mention it, but once I asked where were the strawberries she said ""oh we are out of strawberries so we use pineapple now.""  Hmm okay then.

My coworker got the BLD burger and it looked okay, but was a sloppy gooey mess to handle.  

Service was slow for a non-crowded time and waitress never brought extra dressing for salad but still charged me for it.

I would probably go back for happy hour or on the weekend for brunch, but experience was very forgettable and overpriced for the quality."
Negative	"If I could give it a 0 stars I would.  What a disappointment . Definitely not worth the money for 2 people. I love Michael Jackson and his music . Definitely my inspiration when it came to buying tickets, however this show did not live up to its Yelp reviews . The views of our seats were ""ok"". Security was annoying everytime I had to check my phone he was flashing his bright LED flashlight in my eyes.  Now the show was ""ok"", I'm a fan of MJ and the music is what saves this show.  Way too much just dancing and not enough production behind it.  If you were to compare the ""o"" show to this its like a high school production to broadway.  There were short creative scenes but the people at Cirque definately skimpped on the stagging and being more creative.  With all the access vegas has for its shows and cirque being able to put awesome shows I expected more. Hopefully Cirque isn't loosing its touch, hiding behind its name and getting too big for its own good.  Not worth the close to $400 we paid for not even center lower seats"
Negative	It pains me to write this review... On Feb 9th I was taken in immediately and had my car looked at. The guys are very friendly and thorough (so I thought), and showed me what was leaking and needed to be done. I agreed and consented, had my coolant hose replaced, oils flushed, etc. Yesterday, Feb 20th, my car starting smoking. In a panic to pulled into the nearest parking lot. Upon opening my hood, there were fluids EVERYWHERE. My boyfriend called this jiffy lube location, gave my name and license plate and the man on the phone said i wasn't in the system and i never had my car worked on here?!?!?! No. I have the receipt to prove it. I took my car into a different auto shop, and the man inspecting my car told me devastating news (and showed me)... I need to replace my coolant hose AGAIN because the hose was fastened too tight, caused a tear, and caused pressure to build up making my damn radiator crack. Everything I had done at jiffy lube was $222, now I'm paying $943 for jiffy lube's mistake. I urge everyone to stay away from here, I left a happy customer and my car working decently better, and less than a week and a half later; my car is not operable.
Negative	Left my truck was told it was going to be ready at 4 got there at 4 was given the excuse that the tires were delayed did not end up leaving until 7 pm 1200 dollars not spent wisely and told the manager that I had been here since 10 am his response was I've been here all year not professional never coming back.
Negative	"This was the place to be! back in 1983 now time has been harsh to this place. Maintaince issues and rough edges detract from this place.

Ceiling  lights missing their covers, Tiles on the outdoor baseboards falling off and covered in over spray from a cheap paint job. Staff wearing tuxedo like clothing that on paper looked good but in reality was wrinkled and a thin facade.

The food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor. The bar did seem to have decent prices, and to add to the class the urinals in the restroom have cup holders so you can bring that drink with you."
Negative	Wow... I was so disappointed.  I consider myself a Cirque snob as I have seen about a dozen of their road shows and I will only sit in the first five rows.  Minus one other show, I have always left in awe wondering how the heck those acrobats do what they do.  I was so excited about going to Ka as my boyfriend had never been to any Cirques and I talked it up so much. We sat in the front row but that did not help the show.  I was bored from the beginning but kept telling myself it had to get better!  My boyfriend actually fell asleep it was so dull.  I enjoy Cirque for their unsurpassed acrobatic abilities and this show had none.  Minus the death defying guy on the spinning wheel, nothing left me breathless as so many of their other shows have.  And on that note, we were talking to someone who went to Zarkana and he was talking about the same performance on the spinning wheel and how they made pictures out of sand.  Come on.... they have the same act in two shows and they have the sand images?  I saw that on America's Got Talent.  Cirque is SO above that.  I'm beginning to think Cirque just doesn't have the WOW factor left in them.
Negative	"The food is hit or miss, the service is pretty much miss.

The family decided to check this place out on a Friday evening based on a recommendation of my wife's co-worker.  The Rick Bayless Everyday Mexican cookbook holds an esteemed spot in the kitchen, so I'll admit I set the bar pretty high when evaluating this style of cuisine.

We arrived at 5 pm and our server promptly took our drink order, but things started to slow down.  Despite having three servers working five tables, it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips.   Did I mention that the basket of chip was small?  Our party of four devoured them in three minutes, but no one came by to ask us if we wanted more.  (It should be noted that the first basket of chips was free, after that, you'll be charged $2 for a bottomless supply).  The chips were the star of the evening.  Hot, fresh with plenty of crunch.  I would make the trip to the west side just to get another fix.  The consistency of the salsa verde was a disappointment.  It was far too watery, making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip.

I also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer.  The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection, but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling.  The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish.

After a long wait (about 20 minutes) and only one refill of our basket of chips, we received the entrees.  I ordered one of the specials, a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server.  The beef was tender, but a little under seasoned.  The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef.  I like onions, but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste.  The sides also were disappointing, the re-fried beans were overcooked and lacked texture, the Mexican rice was mushy and bland.  With the little more focus on the details, this could have been a great meal.

The kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas. The salsa verde lacked punch.  The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth.  The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was frustrated with the the use of mozzarella as the filling for the cheese enchiladas.  There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish.

After another long wait, we finally received the bill which totaled $65 before tip for our group of four.  The meal cost was reasonable, but I can't really recommend La Mestiza given the below quality of the food and service I experienced."
Negative	I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally.
Negative	I have been going to this location for several years and it was always a great experience except for the last two times - went there about 2 months ago and the food was not that great. Decided to give it another. On January 20th I went there with my 8 year old grandson and within an hour and a half we both got very sick within a few minutes of one another. I mean SICK. The next day my stomach was still cramping. I will never go back to this location even though it's very close. Heard a lot of good reviews for the one at Queens Plate. Just warning patrons to be EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS if you are brave enough to try this location (Queensway) Absolute worst experience in my life from eating out and had to be close to restroom for 2 days- it was awful, embarrassing and degrading. Shame on them for selling bad or contaminated food smh
Negative	"I loved Umi Sushi in TD Tower until management changed.  Price went up on the Bento box, which i can understand, except now you cant customize it.  I would have understood the change in price, but not the change in recipe and ability to customize. The meat was gross, the Sushi tasted bad, i paid $15 for rice, and i missed the Edamame so much!  
Sad this will be my last time getting a Bento Box here. it was one of my faves."
Negative	OMG,  stay away.  I've anticipated their opening for weeks now.  And actually waited a few weeks so they could work out the kinks.         To start. The service was non existent and the weren't even busy.    Once the manager was made aware of our lack of service and care.  He was less than concerned and not even apologetic.   To top it all off,  I got the Fish & Chips and was sick from food poison I presume alll night.   Such a bad evening and following day
Negative	cpk airport, don't go there if you can avoid it!!!  i  ordered the romain salad, mostly yellow and stalel  lettuce and too much dressing, not eatble and i had to pay over $10 + tax........place was dirty!!!!!
Negative	They were scheduled to come out last Wednesday between 10am and noon and later called after 5pm that day to say they were running late (no way we could do it at that hour). Then they rescheduled for this Wednesday between 8am and 10am and just never showed. Don't waste your time just find someone else!
Negative	"I have had many good breakfasts here.
I decided to try dinner. It was a casual, not crowded early evening. Appetizers were fine. Wine was fine. When the steak was brought out it was well done though had asked for medium rare. I kindly asked  that they try again. The returned steak was a poor cut with seared rare preparation. Away from the outer edge, the steak had garlic and pepper flakes. Absolutely inedible. I did ask to talk to the manager. He was too busy. I simply paid my bill and left.
Will never return again"
Negative	"Wow, I really wanted to love this food truck. I've been following them for awhile. Even liked their Facebook page. Sorta even a fan of their story :-( . I hate giving a bad review but I wished I had read the most recent reviews posted. I guess the 5 star ratings I saw were from 3-4 reviews. 

I was so excited I walk up and tell the owner guy with the Mohawk that I've been following them for awhile. I asked what was their most authentic Korean dish he would recommend. Saying I'm 1/2 Korean and love Korean food.  Also I don't like Mexican food ( all taco meals). 
He says in a condensing way I don't know what you mean about not liking Mexican. He says in a very aggressive way he's the most popular food truck in Phoenix. ( Note I'm the ONLY person there in line) He says ""Gotta make the food sexy."" Blah, blah ok just answer the question.  I ask again. He said probably the kimchi. Then he asks have you had kimchi before? I say I'm half Korean and said I like Korean food. He goes on a rant about being half polish blah,blah. How I'm not going to get authentic Korean food on a food truck anywhere. Blah, blah Btw I have in many cities.  I just want the most authentic even if it's a little authentic. At this point I want to walk away but I'm on a mission to try the food so again I ask for a recommendation. He finally recommends the chicken and rice. I ordered it along with the kimchi. Asking for none of the mayo sauce.  
I hurry home to eat. 

Food review- the chicken was diced into little cubes. It was dry and over cooked. The dish consisted of over cooked white rice and purple cabbage. Also had the sauce that I asked to take off. I get it that's it's not authentic Korean food but it's not even good ""sexy"" food.  He did warn me the kimchi was a little different than the traditional kimchi so thank you. Thats  all I ask tell me about the food in a non condensing way. It was ok (Kim chi) not a fan and pretty pricey for $3. See pictures. 
All in all a big disappointment. If this is how you treat your fans .....All in all a bad experience."
Negative	"horrible, absolutely horrible. i bought a groupon and they refused to do my car unless i paid more and he was arguing with me and being so rude. it was the supervisor at the time and i had to ask to speak to his boss because when he was describing his work, he said that everything looks ""retarded"" and when i asked why he thought it was okay to use that would as anything more then it is, he said it was just a word. never going to even think about buying a service from this horribly ran dirt whole"
Negative	"A coworker booked us here again. 

I gave it 2 stars last time because of some saving graces, but I have to take one away.

Upon walking into my room, the temperature had been set to 62 degrees for some odd reason, and the AC was blowing wildly. 

I was tired and cold and just wanted to get some rest, so I turned the heat on. The room instantly filled with an overwhelming smell of burning death. I immediately shut the heat off, and then suffered (and continue to suffer) through the terrible smell and cold. 

The toilet seat in the bathroom had dried liquid spots on it - I could not tell what they were (I tried not to think about it), but they wiped away easily, meaning housekeeping could have easily cleaned them.

The internet username/password they gave me was case incorrect, and when I finally figured that out on my own and authenticated, the internet was the worst I had ever experienced in a hotel, bar none. Worse than my old 28.8 modem from the 90s. 

I'm currently using my phone hotspot to type this review, because I just couldn't let it go.

Worst starwood brand hotel I've stayed at to date."
Negative	I'd heard the ads on Mix 94.1 for years and thought, they must be true with this testimonials from JC. I bought a hair removal package as a birthday gift for my husband. He likes to have his hair line at the back of his neck looking like it's freshly cut. He went through all the pain of 9+ months of treatments to be hair free on his neck (he complained of how painful it was every time). The only time his hair line on his neck looked good was while he was in treatment. Once he finished all the sessions, the hair came back... and it looks hairier than it did before! Now, I am back to shaving his neck between haircuts and feeling like we were frauded! Hair removal, smair removal... And shame on Mercedes and JC for promoting it.
Negative	I went to get my nail fixed. Mind you, this is the second broken nail within 3 days and that has never happened to me, nor was I doing any type of activity to break them. Regardless, I needed it fixed. She pried the rest of the broken nail off with no regard to the pain it was causing me. She didn't smooth my now rigid nail before super gluing the over large fake nail to the tip. Without measuring this nail to the corresponding nail, she clips it. Obviously too short. She gets out the acrylic gel and plops it on top. I was told to put it in front of the fan to help it dry. Once it was dry enough, she filed the sides a few times, then started painting it!! I'm not a nail tech expert, but I've got my nails done enough to know that she missed a few couple steps. My nails were white but after a week of having them, they looked a little dingy. When she was painting my new nail, I asked her if she suggested I get a new coat all together and she said no. I got gel color and when all was finished, it was BRIGHT white. So bright that it made the rest of them look yellow. I was so unhappy with my service that I didn't say a word because I already knew I was never going to be coming back. The last couple times I've been have been rushed, unorganized and sloppy. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone. STAY away.
Negative	Ordered a meaty Italian pizza via Uber Eats. They send me a crust! Seriously, a frickin' crust, no cheese, sauce or meat. Being late in the evening, I was to hungry I ate the darn thing. I called and all the guy had to to say was I'm sorry, their dough machine went down and I should try and contact Uber... No customer service, shameful.
Negative	"M'kay, so, like - I'm probably one of only five other people on the PLANET who'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Why?  Dunno - just haven't, sue me.  Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.  

Anyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken. 

BUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated. 

There is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.  Otherwise, pass for me, I'll Grand Lux it out."
Negative	"The hype of this place let me down. I was so excited to finally try this place and after the yelp holiday bazaar my friend and I were starving and decided to try it out. I'm a girl who loves her cheeseburgers, but this place just did not win me over. I asked the casher what the best one was and I went for the Sin City burger. I also got the chili cheese fries and my friend and I both decided that those were a major let down. so bummed! My burger was just as this star review says, ""meh. i've experienced better."" it even left me with a stomach ache the rest of the evening.
The layout of this location was a little odd too. the soda machines are hiding on the other end. The people were nice, but that really was the highlight. For the price I don't even think I would be back. I'll stick to five guys."
Negative	"So just had the pleasure of taking my pride and joy 2017 Tundra to the WORST car wash I think I have ever been to. It started with a lackluster greeting from the lethargic employee whom I had to basically sell myself the wash. I selected the ""ultimate wash"", their best(or at least most expensive). I left for 45 minutes and come back to find my truck ""done"". I paid and got cash back for a tip. When I go outside, I don't have to look very closely to see that I have no tire dressing, stuff all over the truck that comes off easily with a tub of my finger, and the inside hasn't been touched(other than a crappy vacuum job). The young man replied when I asked why nothing was done ""there was no number written on the vehicle so we assumed it was the basic"" . He said he would take care of it. All of 5 or less minutes later my truck was miraculously finished. If there is only a 5 minute difference between a 10.00 and 40.00 wash, I clearly made a mistake. He waved me over, I left a tip(because I am still a gentleman) and I left. Upon driving away, I immediately have to adjust my seat because the long drive around the carousel required a seat move(drives me crazy) and the smell of my truck resembles a mix of a cigarette and stale feet. Thanks Francis and Sons for the worst experience ever. I could go on about the run down appearance of the inside, but I will stop with whats important. The wash. Final word, not a good experience from start to finish."
Negative	"4*?!?...have this place changed dratiscally or people just cant distinguish good from bad food?? Most definitely the worse brunch place that I've been in a long time. 

Took their signature dish pain perdu...oh god was it nasty! First, I don't understand why the chef put rosemary in this dish...it gave a weird taste to the pain perdu. Second, the dish was covered in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar...overly sweet.

Also had a meringue bénédictine.  The hollandaise sauce was cold and looked like it had been just heated in the microwave. 

Tried their fresh squeezed mango and strawberry juice and it was horrible as well...$5 for a small juice. It was so bad that I only took a few sips.

3 people and our bill came to $70...overpriced for the quality of food we had. Will never come back.

Heard the table behind us say that it's the best brunch place they have been to?!?..."
Negative	We went to Brothers because we heard the place was great... Not so much. Ordered wings and the Brothers special pizza.  The wings were drowning in sauce but tasted good. They made the decision to replace the green peppers with an over abundance of red peppers without asking us. Since I don't care for sweet red one on my pizza , it was awful.   Also the menu stated that it has extra cheese, more true it looked like less cheese and hardly any meats just a ton of red peppers and onions. Won't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza.
Negative	So second visit, and both times we never got our food?? No manager ever came over, even though our waitress said she would send one over. It was another horrible experience. Got there at 9:40pm, leaving now starved?? The waitress said the kitchen gets overwhelmed, however the table next to us who got there 20 minutes after us, after requesting their food to go due to the long wait, actually got their food, they were brought their food in boxes???? We left with nothing?? We ordered one pizza and 3 calzones, no specialty??? It was on the menu?? The fact that nobody cared, the waitress knew we were upset and could have cared less even after we sat there for 90 minutes. Why does anybody eat here????
Negative	The hotel in itself was very nice: walkable to the higher end hotels on the north end of the strip, KahunaVille had tasty affordable eats and Señor Frogs was a great free place to boogie down. That being said the resort fee was $28 per day and on a 3 night stay we paid about $84 NOT WORTH IT. The fee included some crappy coupons and Wifi that was so terrible I ended up turning It off and just using my 4G. Unless I get free rooms here I will NOT be staying here again.
Negative	It took a couple of years for me to come to terms with writing this review.  I spent a weekend at The Rio in Las Vegas in 2014.  One night, in between dinner and the convention I was attending, I was waylaid by a salesman for L'Core as I walked past their space along the casino.  He wanted to give me free samples and show me a quick hand salt scrub.  I figured, wth, I'll get some samples and my hands will be soft for the night.  No.  He corralled me into the storefront and actually physically tried to prevent me from leaving without buying stuff.  I spent about 75 dollars, which felt cheap to escape without being raped or otherwise assaulted .  Seriously.   I've never experienced the like.  Major fail.
Negative	"I will never ever come to this fucking place again!! I asked for an extra pillow and blanket Sunday night and never got it. Next morning we got up and went to fitness center but left the ""do not disturb"" sign in key hole. On our way we seen a maintenance guy and told him we ask for pillow and blanket last night and never received, he got on radio and told us they would bring to later. We got back to room to find 2 sets of pillow and blankets on our bed even though we left the ""do not disturb"" sign. We started getting ready to leave when my realize her wedding ring was missing from the night stand. We start searching the room and did not find anything. We then came to a conclusion that who drop of the blankets stold my wife's ring. We called security and made a report and they told me they would do an investigation. The next day i got a call from someone in there corporate office telling me that they will not be responsible for my wifes ring because i gave them permission to enter the room even i left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the for door. The cleaning guy said they would bring it up later, never did i let him come in to my room...all i have to say is fuck this place, it's a cold ass casino and there staffs can go to hell!!!"
Negative	I have been coming here for years and the quality of the food has gone down and the prices up.  I received my lunch today (cold), the chicken breast was minimal and it was completely tasteless!  Very disappointed.  With all of the competition they should be worried.  I won't be back.
Negative	"Very disappointed with the service. I called to book an appointment for tile installation and windows. They said they could do that since they are a general contractor they can do mostly everything in a home.
I wait a week for my appointment only to get a call 30 min prior to the appointment to cancel because ""the project that I am doing they are not interested in"".
That is not an appropriate excuse, specially since after my window and tile project I want to remodel my kitchen granite counter tops and I would have been calling them for my second project too.

Poor service, wasted a week waiting for this company when I could have move on with someone else."
Negative	"My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary somewhere special because we've had an extremely difficult year and we needed a cause for celebration.  We had one of our first dates at Va Bene and loved it so much (the only time I would have given it five stars, but that was a long time ago) that we booked the restaurant for our wedding reception.  As most brides, I don't remember much of the reception, but I was surprised to hear bad feedback several weeks after the wedding about the restaurant/reception/dinner from our guests (including my matron of honor who recommended the restaurant to us initially for our date)...so maybe they don't do wedding receptions well..I cut them some slack.  We decided to give them another try for our first anniversary and the food was awful, but the service was worse.  We left so disappointed that we didn't return until last night (many years later) at my husband's suggestion (he wanted a romantic evening).  After reading the great yelp reviews, I thought they had recovered their mojo, but they did not.  We arrived in time for our 7pm reservation, of which they did not have a record...and the hostess didn't apologize, but blamed their systems.  They were practically empty, so they had plenty of room and instead, seated us against the far wall near the kitchen entrance and a large loud table.  I mentioned to the hostess and again to our server that we were celebrating our anniversary.  The server never asked us if we wanted drinks (but we had plenty of water).  One would think that for restaurant that promotes itself as a martini and wine bar, the server would ask about drinks.  If he had asked, we may have purchased their most expensive champagne, but he never asked, never gave us a wine list and he hurried us through a cocktail-less meal.  The calamari appetizer, while huge (because it was served with a salad) was frozen.  I ordered the Va Bene salad and it was soggy. My husband ordered the linguini with seafood and it was salty and my fish (the special) was bland, the spinach was overcooked and the potatoes were undercooked.  The best thing we had was their butter for our bread. Our server did bring us a slice of cheesecake to celebrate our anniversary (I was expecting Italian style cheesecake, but it was the heavy cream NY style cheesecake...it tasted fine, but just not what I expected), but he never asked us if we wanted coffee, tea, after dinner drinks or a different dessert.  I looked around at all the other tables and they had wine, beer, coffee and tea. So I thought, ""what about our faces said we are in a hurry to get home""?  Our date night was an hour long and really, really disappointing.  We were hurried out of an empty restaurant at 8pm.  We will not be returning for any future anniversaries.  Three strikes and Va Bene, you are out!  Our marriage on the other hand, will survive this less than ideal anniversary dinner and we will celebrate next year at an establishment that considers an anniversary special."
Negative	It looks like the men's section is a fraction of the size it used to be. Too bad. Fit is overall unflattering on the mens side with the exception of a few select items that fit a size smaller than I normally am. I'll wait for Uniqlo this summer.
Negative	"Terrible service from sales and front desk management. Dirty hotel. Room not cleaned properly upon arrival. Dirty dishes and trays lined the hallway all day and night. Unauthorized charges on my room bill. Sales Management literally told me ""I don't care"" when I politely tried to share my grievances. It was the most bizarre situation ever I had ever been in at a hotel and I travel weekly for work all over the US. 

Trust me- stay anywhere else besides here."
Negative	"Good God, talk about the longest, weakest pedicure ever. I was already at the mall, and thought I'd spoil myself by getting the first pedicure I'd had in awhile. First off, the water was cold, and when one of the employees adjusted it, it was still tepid. Secondly, the massaging chair? Didn't massage. I don't know if they only turned it on to the rocket launch setting for folks who had both hands and feet done, but the guy who did my nails ignored me come-puh-LEET-ly as he was doing his thing, and didn't seem to understand me when I asked him a question. 

I went for the sloughing of mes pieds because I go barefoot all the time. So, the nail tech pulled out what appeared to be a cheese grater. He went to town after he soaked my feet in some goo and wrapped them in saran wrap. When he was finished, he shook the item in question in the aforementioned cold water, cleaned it, and left it in the foot bath with my feet for awhile. I know it's my dead skin, but I didn't really want to have it floating around in the water with me. 

The nail tech failed to mention that white tips were extra when he asked me what color I wanted, so I was startled when the cost of the pedicure was $10 more than the sign outside proclaimed. I was willing to pay extra for the grooming of my hillbilly feet, but a heads up about the extra $5 for white tips would have been awesome.

Finally, he finished, wandered off, and he just let me sit there. I wasn't even sure if this guy was coming back, or if someone else is going to remove the cotton from between my feet and give me some gnarly flip flops. When he did come back eventually, I was so bored and restless, I was mad I had to pay $27 for something I could have done at home, braless and comfortable, with some freakin' WARM water. My friend and I paid him and hightailed it out of there.

Bottom line: Forget these schmucks. I'm glad I did some maintenance on my lovely feet, but I will definitely yelp where I'm going before I patronize the place!"
Negative	"This is the first review I have done but I had to do it because I want to warn all of you about this store.
I bought a 9-pc dining set from The Brick that was about $1400. I received it and there were all these holes and dents all over the table and chairs. Not to mention that all the chairs have parts shaved off. In total, there was 14 of these!! It was extremely noticeable.
I wanted a return or at least an exchange. I called The Brick and they said that it was part of the ""aesthetic design"" of the table and they could not give me a return of even an exchange! What sort of ""design"" will leave imperfections like this and it doesn't even look good??
But I let that slide and all I wanted was to return the product and get my money back because I am a CUSTOMER and I was NOT SATISFY with my purchase... but they didn't let me.. because of ""policies"" stating that it was not damaged thus I could not do anything with it.
I felt cheated and robbed of my rights as a customer. This was extremely infuriating and I have never been so dissatisfied with a purchase before.

TL;DR 
Horrible product, horrible customer service, horrible ""policies"".
Don't buy from this store. Actually, don't buy from the Brick at all. There are always better options. ALWAYS."
Negative	This is my least favorite location. Customer service ladies always have such attitude and are unfriendly and thats the same with cashiers and sale floor employees. Noone really seems to have direction or a clue where anything is at or what there inventory is.. I dread shopping here just because of the employees...
Negative	Ok, went here last night for dinner.  I think that this place is owned by the gentleman who run the liquor store on the end of the strip mall.  The chicken was fried fresh, but It's no better than the chicken that I fry at home myself. it was just OK.  I do find it odd that they opened this JUST before the popeyes is due to open soon.  No competition what so ever.
Negative	"Well, I'm going to be one of the few naysayers here.  Immediately after being seated, one of our party had cold water splashed on her by the waiter when pouring.  She took it in stride, but still.  Next, I was excited by the prospect of ""the largest selection of sake in Madison.""  After being told that my first two selections were unavailable, the waiter left and then returned with what was available.  Easily half of the list was not in stock.  When the sake arrived, it was not the bottle I ordered, but it was about the same price so I stuck with it, as I was ready for a drink by then.  The 8 oz Kirin I ordered was also not in stock, but the waiter brought the 16 oz and offered to just charge me for the 8 oz, which was fine with me.  

Muramoto is one of the very few places to offer genuine, fresh grated wasabi, rare and expensive at $5 an oz, but worth it if you've ever had it.  Not available at any price.  ""We haven't had that for a year,"" said the waiter.  ""We should probably take it off the menu.""

We began to order.  I was interested in going with ""omakase style,"" to see what the chef at this highly-rated place could do.  ""I don't know what that is,"" says our waiter.  By then, I'm thinking of calling him Dr No.:  Abacore tuna?  No.  Spanish mackerel?  No.   Blue mackerel?  No.  ""We never have all of the mackerels listed on the menu at the same time.""  Too bad, since mackerel my favorite fish.  Bear in mind, we're there on a Saturday night. 

Then comes the sushi.  Although the fish is definitely fresh, the cuts were a bit skimpy for the price.  The bonito had a string of sinew that the chef had neglected to cut out, ruining it for my wife.  More importantly, the rice was a disaster.  It was almost devoid of flavor, and was not correctly sticky.  The raw fish in sushi needs to be properly balanced by the vinegar in the rice; since this had failed, the sushi was bland and uninteresting, regardless of it's quality.  Traditionally, a sushi chef will spend two years of his life mastering the rice.  Whoever is making Muramoto's rice probably started a couple of weeks ago.

Speaking of Muramoto, the restaurant is named for its owner, Shinji Muramoto.  His involvement in the food, however, seems to be zero.  At both Restaurant Muramoto and Sushi Muramoto (which I haven't tried, and never will), the executive chef title goes to others.  At Restaurant Muramoto, it's Brett Olstadt, who has only been with Muramoto and [from what I can tell from his resume] Asian food for two years.  He has not spent his time there studying rice, that's for sure."
Negative	"Absolutely the most disgusting food I have ever seen at a buffet. I know its under $20 but there is a reason for that. Nobody smiles, the place is a mess, nothing is filled up properly and once you are up close to the selections, you realize there isnt much there. 

Most of the food was inedible. I basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies. Everything else was gross and a waste. 

I cannot stress enough what a waste of money this place is. Please eat somewhere else."
Negative	We were so excited to do this and wanted a good challenge. We did the Sherlock room thinking it would be more cerebral than the other choices. What we got was a lot of chaos. One clue did not lead to the next clue. When we failed, we were let in on the way to solve it. Absurd. The idea that we were supposed to figure it out with what we were given was a complete fallacy. Feeling defeated, we asked how many people actually figured it out. Less than 20%. What felt like fun in the room turned to complete disappointment when we found out that the room was literally designed for us to fail.
Negative	So I'm conflicted  with giving this place a single star but I had to for the terrible treatment by the manager KAT to one of her employees BELLE. When on vaca my family always comes to this Dunkin because the coffee is always good and the service is fast.  This is the first time I came and was totally disgusted in how Kat was yelling at her employee. Belle was ringing out the customers the line was long out the door she was also making drinks the only one at the front. The manager KAT comes with her bullying yelling out what's the order I'm taking to you interrupting the customers and Belle taking the order causing confusion. She then begins to bang the sugar container instead of filling it up. I feel she was rude to her employees.
Negative	So I just got back from returning wrestling shoes to this location and I couldn't believe the way I was treated, like a criminal trying to hock stolen goods. I first called the store on S. Eastern making sure they had wrestling shoes in both 10 and 10.5 because I was unsure of my size, they told me they did, and only after I got there the kid tells me he misunderstood and did NOT have the larger size so I drove 30 mins for nothing. The manager then called the store on Durango and the 215 which is literally 45 minutes away from the Eastern store and they put the shoes on hold. I went and picked them up and bought them. I went to my jiu jitsu school and they informed me we are unable to wear wrestling shoes so I finally got in today to return them and went in to the Warm Springs and Durango location. I was well within the return time and they were unused, in the box, and with a receipt showing I paid for them with a debit card in my name. This eliminates any need to question the validity of this return and yet the manager (Marc) looked the shoes over like 5 times, giving me a dirty look the whole time, repeatedly asking me why I wanted to return them even though I explained I did not need them, and finally he asks for my id, which he snatches out of my hand and then drops on the counter, doesn't apologize, and then puts in back on the counter again without even looking at me and begrudgingly has the girl do the return. Am I missing something? I had them in the box still, with the 2 extra pairs of laces that comes with them, and I had a receipt with MY NAME and MY CARD on it and I was still treated so rudely. Why? This is fact though, I will NEVER use any Big 5 Sporting Goods store in town or otherwise and I am going to be sure to tell everyone in my jiu jitsu camp and anyone else I know about my experiences, that's right, plural, and how badly, rudely, and all around unacceptable I was treated from beginning to end. They wasted my time and my money and were rude to me to add to it. Terrible customer service all the way around the board.
Negative	When Mon Ami first opened it was actually pretty good. I most recently went for lunch and was not pleased that it had been turned into a glorified Chilis. The waitstaff has all the flare and service standards down but they are clearly working in a churn-em out place. Several items listed on the menu were clearly for the Chili's crowd as they are NOT in line with French food. The location and view are great. If you do not go to gourmet restaurants and think Applebees is fine for dinner, you will like this place. If you want gourmet- go to Bouchon instead.
Negative	This place sucked. The person who served me was extremely rude and whispered the whole time so when I couldn't hear him he would roll his eyes. He told me the queso wasn't ready but then I saw another guy give it to a customer after me. They literally put two barely fried, cold French fries in my burrito. The ground beef was salty. I really wanted to love this place and rarely give one star reviews but I left so disappointed. It must've been a bad day for them.
Negative	I ordered the new mint mattress on Black Friday and got a message saying that expected delivery was between 2-3 weeks.  4 weeks later I called to find out why my mattress was taking so long and customer service informed me that they were way behind on production and my bed wouldn't arrive until the new year which is actually more like 6 weeks.  The customer service solution was that i go ahead and order their original mattress if i wanted it delivered on time (before Christmas)....if i wanted the original T&N mattress don't you think i would have ordered that one in the first place and not the new one? 2 weeks ago I emailed customer service and the owner to tell them how disappointed I was in their lack of customer service and communication. Never heard a response back.  Wont recommend this brand to anyone and I regret ordering from them.
Negative	Went there last night.. it took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge that we were there and get our water. All we ordered were some strippers and boneless wings.... took an entire hour to get them and they were chewy! Wish I was kidding cause we love Native.. but they seemed more concerned with singing happy birthday 4 times then helping everyone else. Looking around, you could tell everyone was frustrated and had been waiting a long time. At least have the courtesy to come check on your customers and let them know why it's taking so long to get a small order out. Won't be back to this location. We'll make the longer trip to Westgate.
Negative	I'm so disappointed I've never used 1800flowers before. I picked out my bouquet, ordered the medium size asked for same day delivery and at the time of order it said I missed the deadline for same day delivery, ok fine. Then the flowers arrive at 6pm, which is pretty late for a delivery. Ok fine. But the flowers arrived in a tiny case overly shoved with flowers that are not even close to what I ordered!! I'm so disappointed and would not use them again!
Negative	"With all the places to go in Vegas, you would think people would know a thing or two about customer service. This place is a hot mess. We made a reservation for 9 and there is a ""minimum amount"" per person to spend. That is ridiculous in itself but the staff is beyond rude!!! We made a reservation. When we got there, They said they could sit us outside and they didn't have a table for us. Its 105 degrees in Vegas why on God green earth would we want to sit outside? What was the point of the reservation again?
I asked to speak with the manager and she was rude as well, so I wasn't getting anywhere with her. 
The food was meh. Not worth going back, especially with the rude customer service!!!"
Negative	"I definitely have a beef with this place.  There's a long wait, and the food is very very average.  Plus, they pulled that ""sparkling or still"" water crap.  Excuse me if I don't go to fancy places all the time where tap water isn't given as a choice.  Our table of 7 (? it's been a while, I don't remember the exact number) spent about $40-$50 just on freaking water!!  The food was expensive too.

Lastly, I take issue with the whole Buddha, fake Asian thing.  Seems kind of tacky.  And wrong."
Negative	I would like to give a higher rating, but at our annual HOA meeting this week, our manager from Brown Community Management came totally unprepared.  We are a very small community of 22 townhomes.  There is a proposal to change HOA assessment percentages and a notice to discuss this issue was sent to all homeowners and our manager 3 months in advance.  At our annual meeting with over 70% of units represented, there were no financial records available, the percent increase in last year's assessment could not be confirmed (or even remembered), and our manager asked two residents to leave the room to help count the 16 paper ballots instead of staying to participate in the discussion of the proposal.  How could someone responsible for helping our board manage our finances not know anything about our finances and come without a computer to even look them up?  There has to be better management services out there for a small community!
Negative	Only reason i like KK is the taste of really hot and warm doughnuts. The ones i got were cold.  was really looking forward for some fresh doughnuts m. Disappointed.
Negative	"I've been to the salon a few times and they never fail to make me very pleased with my pedicures. However today it was very half effort pedicure experience. I guess I got a fairly new technician because I've never seen her there before. (I usually get the twins but they only work on sunday). When I asked for the color she said they had it, then come to find out they did not have the color I wanted. So I settled for a color I didn't want. But that's no big deal I know that happens kind of frequently due to popular colors. Then as the pedicure began she asked me if I would want my nails cut or filed and I said filed Square. She proceeded to swipe one time with the filer and then stop and be done ,this was when the completely half effort started. She did not get all the dirt out of underneath my nails which made me pretty pissed and then she didn't do the cuticle remover.  when she put the exfoliate on my legs. She never rinsed it off completely, so my legs are gritty, Then whenever the hot rocks came, there was no lotion or oil on my legs it was completely dry and hurt my skin because it was dry and gritty. Then when she went to cure the gel polish she hit the handheld machine on he wet toes multiple times causing bumps that she never fixed. Then she said ""done, you like?"" I asked ""do I not get any lotion? She processed ""oh yeah"" just gave me a little and rubbed it in a little bit. No massage. Nothing.... if this was a $20 pedicure I wouldn't have said anything however this pedicure cost me $46, plus a tip I regret giving. Not coming back anymore."
Negative	I came with my dad on a Sunday afternoon in the winter and the area was pretty empty. There doesn't seem to be much to do or see (especially in winter) aside from the incline. There aren't many shops; most of the area consists of restaurants, most of which are chains like the Hard Rock Café, The Melting Pot, and Joe's Crab Shack. It's not really somewhere I'd go (nor recommend out-of-towners visit) unless it was to go to one of the restaurants.
Negative	We have the Italian beef sandwiches. Service was very nice, restaurant was clean. The sandwiches had no taste, I mean if I didn't know what I was eating and I wouldn't have known. It's really too bad because I wanted to like this place, but never again. Subway has better sandwiches.
Negative	Had a horrible experience . My server was rude and didn't tend to the table that often . Her name was Diana . I don't recommend this place because the food isn't that great and the employees suck at their job .
Negative	Well, it arrived, I can give them a star for that... I ordered using Eat24, and I'll give credit that it came earlier than expected. That being said, I'm kind of shocked that it wasn't hot, barely warm even.  I also selected the spice factor at very spicy, as high as it could be, and this was so bland a toddler could have eaten it. it bordered on sweet even.  I ordered Gen Tso tofu and garlic tofu, lunch and dinner, if you will.  After one was cold and bland I sampled the other, just in case.  The 2 were virtually interchangeable.  Only difference was the garlic sauce was thin and not as congealed as the Gen tso's.  I paid extra on one dish for lo mein, and the amount was not worth it in comparison the the rice that would have been included.  The veggie spring rolls were mush inside.  Over all I was completely disappointing and will stick with Emperors palace or Ty Fun when I need my fix.
Negative	The library is that big but its in the main area of Brampton. I usually go there for group study and its quite hard to talk loud as there are no proper areas for big groups to sit separate from other crowd and discuss. Otherwise its just another library, and is lucky to have a mall beside it where they let people park their cars for longer time.
Negative	"Leaving a bad review may not be one of my favorite things to do, but sometimes necessary. First thing, please remove pot of dirt in entry, it smells horrific and made me want to exit immediately, unfortunately, lunch breaks need to be brief and didn't have time to go elsewhere. Second, the place was empty....strike 2. 3rd issue.....too expensive for poor food prep, presentation, taste standpoint.

I ordered Carmina's, not on lunch menu....11.99, co worker, chicken fajitas, think 10.99. Carnitas came out and the meat was red. Looked like corned beef. Waitress sent manager who said they were cooked 8 hours and lots of paprika used to season. They sure we're tender, but such odd look and texture, I sent them back. Shared Co workers fajitas which were sub pat but edible.

Not good in any way, shape, or form....this place needs serious help. Actually feeling very I'll, hoping I didn't get poisoned!"
Negative	I stayed here just for the night as I was traveling. The room was spacious. I am giving this hotel 1 star though because there were 2 big issues that I had with them while I was staying there. I had my Service dog with me and when I checked in the front desk told me they were sticking us in a room inside the grounds because they didn't want anyone to see my dog in front of the hotel. That was all dandy until I took him outside to do his business and come back inside my room to hear my phone ringing at 1030 at night. It was the front desk informing me that I can not have my dog do his business on property grounds and that I have to take him off grounds for that. They obviously didn't have communication up front in the lobby and to call me at 1030 at night to complain was absolutely atrocious .  Then I wake up at 330 am to use the restroom and as soon as I walked into my bathroom is was crawling with cockroaches from the inside of the toilet to the bath tub and the walls. I had to wake my husband up to kill as many as possible b3cause I feared they would get into my bags. For paying over $100 a night I did not agree to have extra guest in my room. I couldn't go into that nasty bathroom so I went to the lobby to use the restroom and alerted the front desk of my findings. They wrote my information down as I demanded to speak to a manager and I have yet to hear from them. I do not recommend this place to anyone. I am only giving this hotel 1 star because the bed was comfy.
Negative	Dining here has always been delightful; however, Friday proved disappointing! Our delicious salads were delivered by an assistant manager who seemed to enjoy flinging my salad across the table and ended up slamming into my arm! I addressed the matter with him to no avail! This staffer ruins the experience and enjoyment of this venue!
Negative	I got a to go order for a combo of chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki and it came with a little scoop of rice and the salad was horrible.Only a few little pieces of chicken and beef! It was a total ripoff and guess what?$10.95 for the whole combo!!!! I'm never going there again! Oh and if u want good sushi and stuff go to yummy grill sushi. Man that place is bombing! P.S. not literally.
Negative	This place finally got me for the last time.....I had a 30¢ discount on gas which I was using when the pump quit at 5 gallons. Just quit for no reason at all. Cashier barely spoke English and offered no help at all. This is the second time I've had a poor experience with discounts among multiple bad experiences with the car wash itself. These people are crooks....period. My advice, run.....just run away
Negative	Be cautious when internet shopping with this company. They seem like great pricing but They post adds online then raise the prices when you get there.  I saw an add on Facebook stating they had a Buick for sale for $25000. When you try to buy it cash price it's now $26000. Their add said specifically no gimmicks yet here you go. Now you have to use their higher rate financing to get the internet price and nowhere online does it say that or subject to terms and conditions. This is a sleezy technique and I will take my business where they can be honest and upfront with me.
Negative	"I've never actually tried the sushi here but the last two times I've been here was for the chicken curry rice with croquettes on the side.

Its decent, but the croquettes are the best part of the meal. The service was always friendly, and the ambience is quite cosy.

I do think this place is too pricey though given the small portion sizes. The chicken in their curry rice tastes and looks like tofu which resulted in a small incident the last time I visited.

I won't go back, but based on other reviews, it seems their sushi is quite the stunner. So if you're going there for the ""cooked food"" items, then your best bet is somewhere else!"
Negative	This Goodlife location is not one of the best Toronto has to offer. The only positives this location has is their cleanliness and convenience of having it by Toronto's Union station. The staff are incredibly rude here and it's really packed during rush hour times with limited equipment. The free weight section is very small compared to other Goodlifes with 3 squat racks and 3 stair masters.  The gym is heavily supported with treadmills and only has one water fountain at the front.  The change rooms are at the back of the hotel which is inconvenient if you're just putting something in quickly and coming for a quick workout.  Overall, good for convenience but if you can, try to avoid this location during peak hours.
Negative	If I could give it no stars I would. The coffee was good. The staff was decent. It's nice that they had a play area for kids. However, my husbands and my food came out first and we had to wait an additional 20 min to get our children's food. By that time ours was completely cold. We also ordered a sweet crepe but the cream was completely broken and separated. We had such high hopes but needless to say we were completely disappointed.
Negative	This place has the LAMEST mini-golf course I've ever seen.  Maybe it was nice in 1971, but they haven't updated it since.  I haven't really checked out the rest of their offerings, but if they are anything like the mini-golf, I'll pass.
Negative	They recently changed management, chef and menu and this was definitely  a step downward !   Very limited menu, Pasta overcooked, just overall not a good dining experience . I'm a firm believer to give good reviews and not to give bad reviews, but in this case what a miss ! There are better options out there ! I was a fan of this place but not anymore!
Negative	I had to give one star but clearly no stars is warranted. Did not receive my order as I requested. I asked for extra sauce and what did I get.....a super dry ass pizza. SMH what to do? Do I call and say something,  no since I had to waste my money I plan to make sure others don't waste theirs either.
Negative	This place absolutely sucks. First time in Las Vegas - stayed last night at the Vdara (AMAZING!) and this place doesn't even compare to any resort. Their guest services is horrid, had to change rooms bc we got a smoking one when we requested non, and we showed up and they have no fridges/microwaves in any rooms (sucks when you have drinks and food you need to keep cold) Called to inquire, and they charge you (!!!!!) $15/day for a fridge in the room. Are you serious!?? I can go to a Comfort Inn or Best Western in a crappy area and THEY have fridges! Just pathetic. Can't believe this place is on the strip - I'd be embarrassed to say I'm affiliated with this place. Would never stay here again - thankful I just have to survive one night.
Negative	The raw chicken tacos that they served up pretty much sealed the deal on this review.  We're talking as pink as a rare steak - I've never seen anything like it at restaurant.  They comped our meal, but still - not acceptable.
Negative	I was really bothered by this practice. I've been a patient here for a little over a year now and came in to have annual blood work done. The physician came in, asked the standard questions...then proceeded to tell me I smell like marijuana with an attitude. I found that to be extremely bold considering I'm an Arizona State issued medical patient who suffers from chronic pain due to a chest injury from 2011. This isn't 2005 anymore and patients shouldn't be judged if they choose to use legal holistic healing methods instead of being a slave to pharmaceuticals. She made me extremely uncomfortable and the entire appointment felt weird. That being said, I will be looking elsewhere for my healthcare needs.
Negative	"Went to this place to pick up my lunch as I work not too far away from here. The waitress wasn't at all attentive towards the customers that were trying to take the to go lunch and while I was standing there for 5 minutes she never bothered to check if I wanted something. 

I have also noticed that the people who came to dine in after me were attended to immediately while I was just standing there for more than 5 minutes to see someone turn up to even place my order. It's a safe bet to say that I will never back to this place and won't recommend anyone to come here either."
Negative	It's ridiculous how much this place went into the dumps when the new owners took over.. completely different environment, staff, customer service & recipes. Very disappointment to see my fav pizza joint end up like this. Don't waste your time just try somewhere else instead.
Negative	I've been a member of Desert Schools for 5 years I asked the teller to order a new pink card for me and she said come on in we don't have a wait. I went in and waited 10 minutes, then Sunshine helped me get a new card. Not only was it not the color I wanted but when I went to use it my card didn't work. After being on the phone 30 minutes being transferred around to 3 people my card is finally working since Sunshine didn't update accurate card information.
Negative	"It's a No for me! I want to give it a zero but the food is always hot so I'll give credit when credit is due!....but that's it! This place is extremely over priced for the quality and quantity of food given! I have tried it several times, trying to like it. I actually purchased it once with my own money and I said NEVER again! I was so mad because I spent so much money then walked out side and realized I over spent! I basically ordered the special but because I didn't ask for it as ""the special"" they charged me individually which was more (strike 1)...when I asked the cashier she casually said she didnt know how to fix it and politely walked away...(strike 2)...I got home the food was hot but the pizza wasn't flavorful like the cheese tasted like a 50real/50imitation blend the sauce had zero flavor the crust was ok cooked well not too chewy or too hard...but the wings were tiny and not fresh like someone didn't pick up their order and they rewarmed them (strike 3)! I vowed never to spend a dollar there again...but my daughter gets free coupons for grades (she's smart or whateva) and she like using ALL of her freebies no matter what...the rating is the same even when its free! #hardpass"
Negative	"Wow. What a cool concept. I love interesting vegetarian options with tons of different ingredients. So right away Which Wich appealed to me. Grayhawk really needed a restaurant that is unique and offers variety from the usual schtuff. 
The first day I went there I ordered a Hummus Wich. The sandwich would have been awesome had they remembered the main ingredient (the hummus). It took a super long time to get my sandwich so one can only imagine my dismay when I had to go back to have them put hummus on.
Their mistake the first time, shame on them... I went back for a second go around, shame on me. I paid extra for the avocado on my Hummus Wich (which, incidentally, the cashier went through great pains to circle on the menu) only for them to forget. I wish I could say that I'm exaggerating but I literally waited 20 minutes for a milk shake for my young daughter. 
They do a fabulous job with trying to appease angry and frustrated customers and yet, they seem so good at making their customers frustrated in the first place. I was given a free sandwich voucher and a free milkshake voucher. 
It's truly a shame because I really enjoy their food but I really don't want to go back. I guess if you go with the expectation that they WILL mess up your food EVERY time, they will take 20 minutes to prepare a milkshake, and your dining experience will take over an hour (not fast), then this place is the place for you. Definitely come here if time is not an issue for you. Don't bring your antsy kids because they will have to wait. 
Which Wich? I think I will opt for the Wich down the street for now until they can get their act together."
Negative	I ate there many times and would have given four or five stars, but on March 14 The food was so excessively salty I had to take it home and mix it with something to tone it down for tomorrow. Even the bowl of fried tortilla chips they brought as appatizer were heavily salted down , which I never saw before anywhere! The Sonoran Enchilada was so salty I nearly choked on the first bite, and whatever that was they were calling corn enchilada tortillas were hard like cooked Dry-Wall. Even the beans and rice were inordinately salty. The young servers did as well, as they could  in obviously the first job they ever had. (very risky) Indoors and outside patio was busy. NO music balsting was Great!  High school children were serving beer, so check that before you renew your license to serve drinks of that nature.  High school kids as cooks and waiters may be cheap to get, but they will put you out of business fast.
Negative	"I have no idea how they've received so many good reviews. This was a terrible moving experience.

-They started the day by being 30+ minutes late. 
- One of the 2 movers would not stop going on about how hung over he was from the night before.
- I was told when I booked the move that they would provide a mattress bag. They showed up without one. The first time one of them picked up my new $3000 mattress he left his filthy hand marks all over it. They then proceeded to plastic wrap it, which is good, except they used all of it up and only had enough to do half of 1 of my 2 sofas. So not only were the sofas pretty much uncovered but my fabric headboard and bed frame were left completely uncovered.
- They put a nice size hole in my new sofa.
- Every other piece of furniture was left unwrapped and repeatedly placed on barre concrete.
- Once I called the owner to explain what was going on, instead of handling it like a professional, he started cursing about his guys.

I guess the saying ""you get what you pay for"" stands true, just wish $60/hr would buy some level of service.

Would never use this company again."
Negative	"They call themselves a courier company? I don't think so.

The first page on their site boasts ""We're in the business of over-delivering"" and I have never laughed so hard!

I know not to EVER use this company for deliveries, but sometimes when I or my company purchases items, the sender uses them and it's always a huge clusterf*ck. They consistently under-deliver, offering poor customer service and poor service in general.

First the tracking numbers don't work. Then somehow they got the address wrong. Then the online tracker says the item is out for delivery on the truck... only it never shows up. Do they apologize or try to make amends? Of course not! Loomis is in the business of UNDER-delivering, after all!

This most recent experience is infuriating. We ordered a time-sensitive item for work. It shows that it's on the truck, due to be delivered on Thursday. My employee stays home (it was easier to get it sent there, due to our line of work) all day waiting for this package to arrive. Tracking info is never updated and the package never arrives.

Now, my employee is off work for Friday, and not at home so he cannot receive the package for us. We need this for Sunday. I call in and get shunted around to all kinds of different CS reps and told different things. They can't deliver unless someone is there. They can't re-route it to another address that is just up the street. They are waiting to hear from the driver. No one ever calls me back and they're keeping piss-poor notes on this whole encounter, so I have to keep explaining myself over and over. Then they are asking for MORE MONEY to have it sent somewhere else, despite the fact that they screwed up and not us.

All I want is the package. That was supposed to be delivered yesterday. That my employee wasted a whole day waiting for. 

They won't re-route. They can't have the driver stop on his route to meet up (yes, we are offering to pick up our own damn delivery after paying for a delivery service. Unbelievable). They can't get it back to the hold location until Monday, and even then they're not sure if it will be there because they have some kind of issue with their own damn location. My colleague offers to drive all the way out to Brampton to pick it up (which defeats the purpose of using a courier) and they can't even get that together.

So now our time-sensitive package is lost in the ether and we don't know when we will get it. CS and even the supervisor can't just get our package delivered to us. It's so simple, and the whole premise of their business. It should have been delivered yesterday and now they won't go the extra mile to get it to us. This isn't how our own business operates and I'm shocked that they aren't doing everything in their power to get it to us. Someone from their company should be going out and getting it and hand delivering it to us at this point. They're in Brampton, we're in Toronto. It's not far.

I've had to do so much work trying to track this down and get it delivered, I can't believe it. So here I am, having to air my dirty laundry on Yelp. I'll be forwarding this to the company and also encouraging every other business owner I know never to use this service. I'd rather pay more for UPS, which even while totally shitty, will still get the package to us after some prodding.

Avoid this company at all costs! Pay more to get a competent delivery company!"
Negative	Very rude and homophobic people here, ruined my credit when I came back trying to by a 2nd new vehicle and ran it through over 12 banks with hard inquiries even though I asked them not to
Negative	I don't get it.... I thought the food sucked. The people weren't very nice and the food was mediocre at best. Yeah the banana nut muffin was ok but not like wow! The seasoned potatoes were kinda nasty. I like season salt on my fries but theirs was GROSS!  Maybe I just didn't want breakfast that day... I do try to have a rule to try a place out 2x before I say no completely. I just don't think I will be trying it soon.
Negative	"It's very off putting to see a restaurant with the volume of clientele be so petty to charge 3% for credit card transactions. Most people don't carry cash in a regular basis.  Especially when they don't know how much their bill might be. 

I own a small business as well. Yes, we do charge a convenience fee for credit card payment. But our business transactions in 1 months probably doesn't even come close to their daily charges. Unfortunately for small businesses who have very little profit, it's necessary. But for the volume this restaurant does daily, is just petty. I'm quite certain their wholesale cost isn't $15 for the ingredients. There's plenty of profit from the food to cover it. 

Since we never carry cash in us, we won't be back for long waits and greed."
Negative	Currently sitting here for lunch. Took 25 minutes to wait in line and order. There were about 10 people ahead of me the place is nearly empty and the size of an airplane hanger. Tons of staff standing around doing nothing while two people take orders and three cook. Took another 15 minutes to get a cold sandwich and side salad. The side salad has 6 pieces of lettuce in it. What a horribly run operation
Negative	I just found out about Yelp so I want to let the consumers know about Applebee on Spring Mt and Rainbow me and my son went there on Feb 2 2016. I order the quesadilla burger he had a regular burger we both had ice tea as drinks. First they don't let you know that  the game that you're playing at the table they're charging you for. So you don't know that until you look at your tickets that you got charged for a game that would just sitting at the table. Second $35 for two hamburgers and two drinks. Third it made me sick as a dog me and my son was sick for two days after eating their. Don't waste your money. I will not be going back their.
Negative	"Went there to grab a couple pastries for a friend and I. Nothing had a price OR a name; there was no way to tell what anything was or what it was made of except by eyeballing it. 
When I asked if there was a price list, the server acted like she had no idea what I meant. How odd of me to ask for prices *in a store*.

The pastry itself tasted like a hostess bar. You could get better quality buying an old box of Twinkies."
Negative	"This is a review for their bar area ONLY.  

I've been to Tommy's for dinner before which I thought was good, but pricey. Anyhow, back to the bar. My fiancé was really excited to take me to Tommy's for HH, because he had went with his friends and he raved about their excellent martinis. I LOVE martinis, so I was excited too. We decided to stop by for HH, the bar was packed. We decided to come back after walking around. We were just in luck, there were 2 seats open at the bar. The bar was clearing out as HH had just ended, but we didn't mind, because I JUST had to try this martini. We sat there for about 10 minutes and finally a bartender came up to us and we asked for their drink menu. As I had stated before the bar was emptying out and by that time the bar was only half full. There were seats next to us that were now empty. One guy came and sat in the seat next to us. The bartender gave him a drink menu right away. Another 10 minutes passed and no one has come by and asked if we liked to order anything. (It didn't seem like they were too busy as the bartenders were chatting with people and to each other). The guy next to us had already gotten his drink like 5 minutes ago. We left shortly after that. There was no reason why were ignored at the bar for 20  something minutes, we were sitting right in front and it was just ridiculous how we were being ignored. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in their lack of service and I won't be coming here anytime soon. I definitely don't recommend this place to anyone."
Negative	"This is the third farm this fall season & it was not impressive. 
$10 for hayride that was super bumpy & trees might hit you on your head. 
Pumpkins were overpriced. ($25 for the largest one) I paid $12 for the largest size pumpkin at a different pumpkin patch. 
Farm animals- 2 goats, some horses, pig, baby quails."
Negative	"I booked the flight through a travel site but and paid for everything up front come to find out I had to pay another 130 dollars in bag fees and to have my kids seats next to mine. I chose that flight for the price of flying with a family of 5 but for 120 dollars more I could have flown on another airlines at a better time and only paid for 1 bag. The seats are worse than a school bus according to my kids and I fully agree. If you are going to charge people to pick seats next to each other you should make it worth it.

I used to fly frontier a lot and after this flight I will never fly you again. I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't fly with you again. My company flies me all over and I will make sure they don't use you. Even your flight attendants told everyone to make sure you seats are in the upright position, well that's the only position available on our seats. Maybe you should update your training policy as well. 

You should add a note to any travel website selling your tickets that you will be paying more than what you see on your screen. So just be ready. This whole statement is going on yelp as well so everyone can know how piss poor of an experience it was. The only good thing that came out of it was we got home safely. Thank god for that. I'm surprised you didn't have a surcharge for a safe landing to be honest. 

I posted this exact comment on their survey. Bet I never hear from them. Poor excuse for a business. Sad they had to stoop to Spirit Airlines level. The only reason I would give 5 stars is if was a negative 5 stars."
Negative	"Okay, received unsolicited homeowners sample quote.
When I called the number on the letter; the office clerk had no way to track the ""sample quote"" they sent nor was she able to write a proper address to see about getting a quote.

The phone clerk then agreed that I should just throw the letter away and make believe it was never sent.

Sorry that I opened mail from Farmers... my usual is Chubb (quality is less aggravating!)"
Negative	"Bad bad bad!
The two employees greeted me and then went on talking to themselves which usually I don't care but then I saw how there are no samples, things need to be unboxed, displays aren't finished. I mean this makes sense that they could be out of stock on a few things but the boxes with the products were ON THE FLOOR. I asked one of the employees about the BITE lipsticks and he said I could check out any of the samples(which there was only a few) or he could find one for me. He also said I could even look MYSELF. 
WHAT?? I could be some kleptomaniac and ran with the whole box 
Don't go in here. Drive your butt down to a mall where there is a Sephora :/"
Negative	Kinda annoyed. Took forever to get attention despite most of the tables being empty. Beer was fine and cold but late. Chicken was burned and rubbery. Definite avoid. Plenty of other places around.  It does have power outlets though.
Negative	"My wife and I had gotten married at the Tuscany chapel in 2011 and we stayed there as well. We had a wonderful experience there and decided to return for an anniversary trip in July, 2014.

Upon scheduling the reservation over a month ahead of time, I made a note that we would like a microwave, since we knew that they had them available. I called the night before leaving to confirm the reservation and that a microwave would be available, and the guy said ""Absolutely. I see the note right here.""

Upon arriving into the room, since I forgot to mention it at check-in, I called to get the microwave delivered, and the lady said ""If we have one available, I will get it delivered to you as soon as I can. If there isn't one available, since we are fully booked, you will go on a waiting list."" I challenged this with the information that I had made a note on my reservation. And she responded ""We never guarantee extras such as a microwave. They are first-come/first-serve."" Well, we got the microwave, but I didn't appreciate the way I was treated.

Other things that caused the 2-star review...the rooms are falling apart. The baseboards in the restrooms are falling apart, the toilet runs if you don't shake the handle, there are stains on the carpet, and the bed is uncomfortable (considering there is a thick mattress pad under the sheet, that must mean they buy super cheap mattresses), and I will give any hotel a lower than normal rating when they charge the exorbitant resort fees. Yes, we knew about it ahead of time, and yes we know that most of the hotels in Las Vegas charge them, but no one needs to be a copy cat. And yes we know what it's for, but that leads me into the next complaint...

The resort fees cover things like Wi-Fi and access to the pool and laundry areas, right? Well I have complaints about all three. I pay $45 per month at home for 30MB high speed Wi-Fi internet. I pay, I think a $17 per night resort fee for access to only 1MB internet at the Tuscany?! Give me a break!!

The laundry facility is nasty. There are only 3 washers and 3 dryers and ALL are falling apart.

The pool is a joke. It's small and dirty. Filthy, nasty, wet dirty towels ALL OVER THE PLACE. The chairs are stained with who knows what and we had to remove someone else's dirty towels because all the chairs were covered and there weren't even that many people there. So this means that, clearly, someone was negligent in cleaning up the area. Oh and tufts of black hair were floating around in the pool, suggesting that the pool's filter system is not effective.

The only reason for the extra star is because I know there were worse places we could have stayed. And I get that. But our stay in July 2014 did not reflect our impression of the Tuscany in 2011. We want to stay here every time we come to Las Vegas because this is where we got married. So either shape up or we will tell everyone we know to not stay there!"
Negative	Based on the reviews this place should be amazing. Got the pulled pork sandwich solid 3.5 stars barbecue sauce was on. The rack of ribs were good but sorry real barbecue is smoked not baked. To much liquid smoke flavoring. It could have been fluke night so I will try it once more.
Negative	The music they played on the speakers was to loud to hold a conversation over - then they turn it off for live music that was impossible to speak over.  Good place to go if you are with people you don't want to talk to.
Negative	"Having a conversation with another guest, this place feels like a tiny lounge, in a small airport, in a county like Mexico.  It feels temporary, but I think it's just the new lounge.  

My girlfriend said the bathrooms are clean, but very poor quality toilet paper.  

It's nice that there is a cooked to order egg station, oh but wait, only regular fries or scrambled.  No cheese, no mushrooms, nothing.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  

The staff isn't overly friendly and speak loudly across the room in another language, as if that made it so we didn't know they were speaking.   

You don't have another choice in this terminal and it's finally a solution since the admirals club stopped taking Amex a couple years ago.  But don't be expecting this to be a retreat on a long journey."
Negative	Was excited to try the ramen but at the end of the day it was mediocre at best. Had a bowl with ground pork (which I didn't realize would be ground until it arrived..but my mistake, since it was written in the menu. Still weird.) and thin noodles. The noodles themselves were hard, and the I found broth lacking in flavour. The quality of the meal strangely reminded me of a bad chain restaurant, until I realized after looking online that they ARE a chain restaurant. Quite uninspiring overall. There are much better places in Calgary for authentic ramen which actually tastes like it, like Umami or Shikiji. Which this meal made me sad I didn't pick
Negative	The staff was friendly...but I left unsatisfied.  It was just a sandwich.  I was hoping it would be better than a Subway, Blimpie or JJ...but not at all.  I say to skip it and save your 9.00 bucks.  I left hungry and wanting something to sink my teeth into.
Negative	"Skip it if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  I had a piece of fish which I ordered ""plain"".  I guess I should have specified 'not soaked in butter and oil sauce'. The chopped salad was OK.  The breads tick was a soft pretzel stick.  For a $50 meal this was mediocre at best. It was worth about $12.

The wait staff was great -  fast,  friendly and the ideal level of attention.  Too bad the food is overpriced and not so great."
Negative	"Extremely poor quality of work.  Incapable of properly cleaning a camera. The manager is the salesman, the receptionist and the repairman, all of that at the same time. A ""jack of all trades and a master of none)
Prepayment was required for the cleaning of this camera when in fact the camera costs 5 times the price of the repair.  I am just wondering if this company has an insurance in case of theft?
There are plenty of reputable camera shops in town.  For sure, we won't use this one anymore.  Just glance at the BBB reviews and make your own decision."
Negative	How they made a burrito so bland and tasteless is a mystery to me. It was completely void of flavour. Felt like I fell for a food scam. I have no idea how this chain is still opening new stores.
Negative	"After hearing really good things about Bobbie Sue's I was pretty psyched about trying their Mac and cheese. I have to regretfully say that it did not live up to the hype. I got the ""hamburger who lends a hand"" and it was pretty dry as there was definitely not enough cheese sauce. It was underwhelming to say the least.

Perhaps they were having an off day but regardless, I was massively disappointed."
Negative	Only come here if you want wings and cheap beer. The menu food is horrible. We got the chicken club and it was rubbery and overly greasy, the fries were old and soggy. I would recommend never to get food here.  Also, The service is terrible. We got our utensils, water, napkins, and menus removed when our food came and it was from a different waitress not our own.  There are better sports bars in the valley.
Negative	"Burger was obviously a frozen patty - dense, bland, dry. I found it humorous that I was asked how I wanted it cooked, as it came out a uniformly brown/gray color. 

Absolutely will not be eating here again. I am surprised Sharp Edge is still in business with all the excellent options within steps on Penn Avenue."
Negative	"This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however, is the SLOWEST one in the world. 

The line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced. 

Also the parking is horrible. The ""lot"" is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over. 

All in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking."
Negative	Honestly...   Food was not great.   I had better at Taco Bell.   Chips were pretty good...  Salsa horrible.   Customer service was descent although our waiter got mine and my friend's orders wrong.
Negative	Stopped by on a Sunday night, close to closing time (big mistake) ... Waiter seemed annoyed, we ordered penne Bolognese ... They brought bread ... Chucked it on the table as they walked by ... Went to the bar and asked for balsamic vinegar and olive oil ... Annoyed waiter brought it to us without a plate to put it on ... Got the pasta ... No mention of parmesan ... No mention of drinks or wine ... Went back to the bar ... Couldn't get anybody's attention ... Finally asked for two house reds and parmesan ... Nobody checked in on our dinner ... WTF?!  Girlfriend's birthday dinner, and this is how they roll? Zero tip.
Negative	"I purchased 2 sets of tickets through these guys.  

First, Circus 1906.  Didn't love the show but that's not TIx4Tonight's fault.  No problems with the tickets.  All good.

We also purchased tickets to WOW and here's where the problem kicked in.  We asked for the 9:00 show, which is what we purchased (and confirmed via the printed receipt).  Per instruction, we left the Fashion Show Mall booth and headed to the LINQ promenade, as we were told we'd obtain better seats by doing so (as opposed to presenting to the box office an hour before the show).  We picked up our printed tickets to WOW a day ahead of time at around 11:00 in the morning.  

So, day of WOW comes and we arrive at the Rio at approximately 7:45.  We pull out the tickets to see which theater we need to go to and realize it says a 7:00 showing.  Um... Not okay.  

After a kind and professional lecture that the tickets were booked via a third party and we'd need to contact them directly for assistance, the Rio staff finagled a way to adjust our tickets and get us into the show.  (They were awesome!)  We had the good fortune of being there on a night when seats were still available and meeting people who were willing to help.  I would guess on another night our luck would have not been so great.

As for that need to go to the LINQ promenade to get the better seats, we had the worst chairs in the house.   And, before you say but they squeezed you in, we were booked in the EXACT same seats for both shows.  Sham it was.

Who knows.  The lady at the LINQ promenade seemed like she was not enjoying life, so perhaps we just ran into a crappy situation.  It was not pleasant.  It was stressful.  Will I use Tix4Tonight again?  Hmm... don't know.  I'd probably try other resources first.  That being said, a budgets a budget... Sigh."
Negative	I'd go with a zero star rating if possible. I ordered the non-spicy pork bone soup and somehow, they managed to bring me the spicy version. Yesterday, one of my friends visited the same restaurant and ordered pork bone soup,. and he received a one that was not fully cooked. There was this male waiter who was not so friendly after we pointed out his mistakes, and responded to me in a sarcastic manner.
Negative	First time lunch customer ordered the regular sized Original Philly with Whiz combo meal came to about $13 no tip. Tad spendy for lunch but it came out as a large portion. Two issues with the sub. The meat is low quality, not rib eye like you'd get in Philly. This is Paradise Valley, lets get some actual steak in your cheeseSTEAK. The problem with many middle of the road places is that the bad ones will always go quantity over quality. Anyway, the sandwich was constructed wrong. They put the whiz on the bread like a spread, like mayo. When what you need to do is put the meat in the bread first, then pour the whiz over the top of the meat. Won't be going back.
Negative	"This restaurant is right next to my house, and today I really felt like Vietnamese sandwiches. So I thought, why not!

The restaurant is a bit small, but clean. I was greeted right away by a nice young man who gave me a menu for take out. But I didn't need it. I ordered 4 special Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi dac biet) He immediately apologized and said they didn't have the meat needed to make that sandwich. Hmm.. OK.. I thought about leaving, but decided to try something else. 

So I ordered their rice dish with pork chop and shredded pork (com tam suong bi cha). He apologized and said they didn't have the pork chops to make that dish. 

What! How could you be a functional restaurant and be missing all these key ingredients?? So I thought about walking out again, but the man was genuinely apologetic and nice. So I stayed.

He recommended the spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue). So I ordered 3 orders of that and 1 order of seafood crispy noodle (mi sau don). I did that because I was worried about the freshness of the food here if they were missing so much... I wanted to order something they HAD to make fresh. Not just something they can scoop out of a pot, because who knows when they made that soup??

The nice man gave me an iced tea to sip on while I waited. It was a short wait. I got my food and paid and left.

I admit I stopped by the bank to deposit a check through the ATM, but it was a quick stop. Then I went home.

My husband took the food and started to take everything out. Then he asked, ""did you stop somewhere before coming home? Everything is cold."" COLD? The ATM was NOT that long. 

So we heated it up. And then my husband didn't let me eat anything! I'm 5 months pregnant and we've been very careful with the food I eat so I don't get sick. And all the food looked OLD. The toppings on the crispy noodle looked dried and recooked. The noodles itself didn't taste freshly fried. It was oily like it was sitting in oil 2 days ago.

The noodle soup base was good, but the meat looked dried and old too! It also looked funny! 

Ugh how disappointing. I was excited about not having to travel to Chinatown for Vietnamese food. But this place is disgusting. How could they serve food like that? I am not a picky eater so this review could be so much worse if coming from a picky eater!

We are definitely never going back. They need new management. Either that or they think they're serving to people who don't know what Vietnamese food is.

I do have to give credit to the nice man who took my order. He was genuinely nice, genuinely apologetic when things I ordered weren't available. But he needs to leave and find a decent restaurant to work for.

My first one star review :("
Negative	"Horrible Management. Liars and thieves. Unsafe environment.

This cannot fully describe the horrors of this apartment complex. If there was a zero rating, that's what I would give.

 I lived in Villagio Apartments for 2 years and a half. After I moved out, I was extremely surprised to receive an email with my move-out statement that stated that I needed to pay for a new carpet replacement and that the amount would be taken out of my original deposit. To say I was confused and shocked is an understatement. Let me explain. 

 1. I was told by the property manager Pam Kiriakidis NOT to have the carpet cleaned myself and let Villagio handle the carpet cleaning, and she assured me I would ONLY be charged the cost of the carpet cleaning. I agreed to this. This was a mistake as I came to realize she only told me this to trick me into leaving the apartment without cleaning the carpet. 

2. When I first moved in Villagio apartment complex, the carpet was very thin, definitely NOT new and even had stains on it. I specifically asked to either get a new carpet, or at least have those stains removed the day I moved in. I was told they would not get me a new carpet, and that the stains could not be removed. I wrote on the move-in form about those stains. There is absolutely no reason why I should buy a new carpet for an apartment I moved in that had an old , stained and used carpet in it. 

 3. After replying to Villagio's email about my move-out statement, and stating I did not agree to me getting charged the cost of replacing the carpet with a new one, I got an email back from Jeffrey Keeney, the Assistant Community Manager, stating that they would split the cost of replacing the carpet with me. I have been trying really hard to understand the rationale behind this.  Either I am responsible, or I am not!! If at least I had gotten a new carpet when I moved in, or if I had damaged the carpet when I lived in Villagio, it would make some sense. 

They have absolutely no shame whatsoever stealing my deposit money. 

Oh, and I almost forgot, when I lived there, there were 2 shootings. My building was even yellow taped and TV crews dispatched.  Police was constantly there. Villagio apartments does not give you a feeling of a safe environment at all!! 

I am utterly disgusted by this place. It's been 4 months since I left Villagio, and they still have not paid me my deposit money back.

 I would not recommend Villagio Apartments to anyone. DO NOT rent there, they will con, lie and steal from you. Be careful!!"
Negative	How places like this stay in business is baffling... Not a single customer here is happy with their service or lack there of. After seeing chapmans service in Arizona I should have stayed away, that was my mistake to come back.
Negative	"I called this company 10 days ago and spoke to Phil, who supposedly is the President of the company. He came by my house the next day to give me a quote which I accepted and then he said he'd call me to set up a date to do the job. After a couple of days, I didn't hear from him so I called again. He said he had a job on the other side of town and he'd call me in the next few days. Again, no call. I texted...no response. I called yet again on Wednesday (8 days after our initial contact) at around 11 am and he said he was driving at the moment but he'll be at the office in about 20 minutes at which time he'd pull my quote and call me back. I waited over 5 hours until 4:45 pm and still no call, so I called him yet again. It went to voicemail. I left a message for him to call or text me back. More than 24 hours later and still nothing.  The next day, I finally got a text from an unknown number asking if Monday would work.  No it won't!  Too little, too late!  I probably only got that text because I posted a negative review on Facebook.  Seeing as folks probably use Yelp more for this kind of thing, I wanted to make sure I posted it here as well. 

To say I'm disappointed is a major understatement. This is just piss poor customer service and no way to treat a potential paying customer. The lack of follow up is unbelievable!  The customer should not have chase you down to give you money for a job!  I had a small job that that they overquoted me for but I accepted it because I wanted it done by a pro and in a reasonable amount of time. A job well done would've led to much more (my whole house needs a paint job) but the fact that they couldn't be bothered to get back to me let alone schedule something tells me I was right not to ask for a quote on a bigger job. Why couldn't they just be honest about it instead of jerking me around and then ignoring me? Absolutely ridiculous and completely unacceptable."
Negative	Our server was excellent and very friendly. The restaurant itself was nice and clean. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. I got a few soft tacos with different meats, they were all very bland and were soaked and dripping with so much grease that I lost my appetite and didn't finish my food. The service was great, but because of the food I will not be back.
Negative	First of all the wait time is horrendous.  It wasn't as busy as Pai or the main stream Thai food. The calamari was small portioned and just full battered.  Did I mention the wait time? We waiting for 30 minutes to get fried calamari. And another for the entrée. Yet take outs come and go!!!!!... Seriously...  Food was 4/5...  But the wait time Holy shit. And we ordered chicken pad Thai and got BEEF!... If you plan to eat here go take out seriously.
Negative	My fourth stay at the Signature really soured me on the Hotel.  My room's TV didn't work for 3 out of my four nights there, and the hotel did next to nothing to help, despite being unable to fix it.  I wasn't moved to a different room, I wasn't comped a night -- I was given a $50 food credit, which hardly made up for the TV going out in the middle of the NBA Finals, and then having to have repairmen in my room on two separate occasions -- neither of which resulted in the TV being fixed.  This place is showing its age -- no luxury hotel should leave a guest with a malfunctioning, unwatchable tv for four nights.  Shame on the Signature.
Negative	"What a joke. 25 minutes in the drive through for a  burger. When I said to the people working the drive they were not doing a good job, they had no idea what I was taking about. Sad really, they had no idea of the definition of ""fast food"". The owner of this franchise might want to retrain the employees in fast food. Clean restaurant, yes. Good food, yes. Slow service definitely... I will never go here again!"
Negative	This was a terrible experience.  I was looking for a nutritionist for my 18 year old daughter. All we received was a one hour lecture on how to become vegan. We were never asked any questions about our lifestyle or what we wanted. The office was dark & dirty. In the waiting room a video was playing on how everyone is dying of cancer. It was depressing and a complete waste of my money!
Negative	If I could give a NEGATIVE star rating I soo would everyday !!! Service was awful waiting was even worse !! Waited over 3 frkn hours !!!! They literally NEED lots of help here ! Hungry and angry  service upfront was rude
Negative	Things sure gave change since this new company has taking over . I am taking many notes regarding my conversations with management.  Really looking for my lease to be over .
Negative	"Not worth the time - was offered VIP access by a promoter on a Saturday night that the wrist bands I got would get me in for free and open bar till midnight ...got to the door and the hostess tells me its 30 bucks to get in instead of 40 but it was still open bar ...took a chance and got inside - this place is small ...more like a bar trying to be a lounge ...and small...I couldn't believe i saw people actually falling for what was VIP type seating next to the dance floor ...probably paid waaaay too much for it as well 

Free drinks were well drinks - horrible cheap vodka - i stuck to the cheap rum, no beer offerings in the open bar - midnight hit and I see people turning in drink tickets but was told the ones I had were able to be redeemed after midnight ...really...so the people next to me got the hall pass but not me o_O

People in there were very much out-of-towners, bit of an older crowd with no knowledge of where to go for a Vegas night out...DJ was average at best-really got the impression it was amateur hour when i was in there ...didnt stick around to waste money on drinks and left not much past midnight for something else"
Negative	I come everyday, I mean every single day before work, never had a problem but the guy that works in the morning drive thru sucks and it's pissing me off that every time I go thru the drive thru my drink is leaking, has caramel all over the cup. He ATTEMPTED to double cup my drink, well it spilt everywhere and today it overflowed an spilt on me again. This location is by my job and I don't want to have to go to another one. The guy needs to get his shit together for real. I called and the y said they will give me a new drink but that's not the point, he needs to watch what he is doing...
Negative	"2 bean tostadas + 1 breakfast sandwich = $16 
wow ! wth? i work around the corner but now i'm gonna drive the extra miles to eat anywhere but here . waste of money ."
Negative	Very disappointed. Today they tried to require me to pay for a service that I have never paid for the last 10+ times at EWC. That's a scam IMO, and I won't be coming back.
Negative	My friend who is 22 years old has been waiting out front of your establishment for about 30 minutes waiting for the police to come and verify his ID. This is the 3rd time this has happened and this is unacceptable. I would like some sort of refund from your business for these problems. My friends don't want to come here anymore and I would assume your door men know an ID especially if it is real.
Negative	"The best thing about the ""New"" lotus of Siam is the location. The original establishment located in a not so good neighborhood, (read Crack district) is a breath of fresh air ambiance wise. However.....The food quality was not so much to snuff for this very much opinioned restaurant. The ""Special house fried rice"" was ok but it lacked a mouth feel due to a overly sweet pineapple taste that overwhelmed the dish. Quite ""Sticky"" also. Only 2 jumbo shrimps were in incuded in the dish and for a $16 rice dish it was so-so. The very much talked about ""YUM NUAH [Thai Beef Salad]"" had a very strange sour-dish taste. Either it had some strange vinegar of another ingredient that rendered the dish inedible. Not a dish that was well prepared. The ""Yellow Curry"" was quite good however. It had the right mixture of spice and mild curry that made this dish on-par with descent Thai restaurants. It did lack a few extras like cucumbers, etc. Not exactly a ""Best of curry dishes"" in comparison to ordinary Thai establishments.
     The presentation of all 3 dishes with very, very good with smaller portions that are indicative of high end restaurants. The new building, (Roy's Hawaiian Fusion Was the former tenant) and the interior design was fresh and inviting. The wait staff was omnipresent and very attentive throughout lunch. There was a patron in the back room with an infant that was absolutely screaming and crying throughout the time spent there thus ruining the dining experience. the staff did attempt to confine the ""Screamer"" to the back room but it was an issue nonetheless. 
   Lotus of Siam should take a page from the restaurant ""Herringbone"" at the Aria where they have a tasteful sign at the entrance that states ""We apologize but children under the age of 3 are not permitted in the dining room, (Common amongst high end restaurants.)"" Lotus of Siam are you listening? The prices have increased which is commiserate with a new environment. The original Lotus of Siam had a collapse of the roof and will reopen when a renovation is complete. The Owner started Lotus of Siam as a very capable chef and rendered some of the finest Thai cuisine available. The Owner needs to spend more time in the kitchen and less at the decorator store.
    Conclusion: although the new digs are superb and the staff is spot on, the dishes fell short of an alleged ""Best Thai restaurant"" in the country. If you really want to have a true taste of Thailand seek out ""Baan Thai"" located on Spring Mountain road a short distance away. I am a Las Vegas Local and hoist in my opinions."
Negative	Don't know why I haven't done this before but absolutely the worst Panera I've ever experienced. Gave them many chances because I do like their food and they are convenient to work. But they are frequently out of coffee (one time completely out at 9:10 am and after waiting 5 min. Still no coffee!) customer service? Worst ever! Management? Disengaged at best. Downright worthless the rest of the time. Corporate needs to wake up. I've boycotted this location for the past 4 months and feel much better for it!
Negative	I wanted to try Habit as it was new to me. Although the reviews weren't raves, I stopped in for lunch. The service was fast and friendly and the location clean. I did think it was pricey for not having table service and the food was ok. I had the mushroom Swiss. It didn't appear that these were fresh mushrooms and the cheese had an odd texture. There is also a difference between a toasted bun bad one that so getting stale. It was pretty firm. I'm glad I tried Habit but I'm not sure I would return even with a coupon or special offer. Just think there are better $8 lunch options.
Negative	Complete disappointment - I called to make an appointment for this evening and was told there were several available openings, one being in the next 30 min.  I was then asked if I was a member or a new customer.  Once I mentioned I was a new customer, I was put on hold for several min only to be told that the 2 available  appointments had been booked and the next opening was at 9pm.  No thank you.
Negative	Option one was my go to plumber for every plumbing job i had in the rentals I own. I had been happy with their work. On the last job I used them for they fixed a leak under the floor. Instead of using the correct 90-degree fitting they forced the pex to bend to make a straight fitting 'work' and charged $312. When I went back to the house i could still hear the dripping. I went back under the floor myself to discover the stress put on the line by the wrong fitting. I got the correct 90 degree fitting myself  for about $10 and replaced theirs, relieving the stress on the line and fixing the problem. Very dissapointed, they have lost a repeat customer and I have moved on.
Negative	"Well they have a 90 for their sanitation score. I don't think I've been to a gas station McDonald's with a rating that low. 

I had read the reviews and had no intention of coming here, but my mom wanted to try it. So I got a side size chicken ceaser salad, my mom had a side size southwest salad and my dad had a burger.

The place was basically empty at 6:30 on a Wednesday, our food came out quickly. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 cause the salads weren't bad, but they were very forgettable an unremarkable. Not something I'd ever go back for. My dads burger was very small, bland and dull. 
I give this place 6 months."
Negative	"I was on strip with my fella and decided to grab a quick bite at the Riviera. I remembered they had a food court and recalled some positive reviews for India Masala. 

My expectations were low, but I persevered. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which came with rice and a side of naan.

The curry was decent. Not very spicy and more on the bland side than I would prefer, but still ok. The rice was dry and overcooked. It was clearly sitting around a while so I avoided it. The naan was my favorite part of the meal. It was overly oily, but delicious. We were tempted to order an extra one for dipping, but decided against it.

Decent for a food court and probably ten times better than the other food court options at the Riviera, but that isn't saying much."
Negative	Worst experience ever, made a reservation for 12:30 and had to wait extra 45 min to seat down and the food was mediocre, very bad hospitality and rude hostest, management did not do anything too. Do not eat at this place
Negative	"WOW - 18 months later Artie Bucco Jr sent me a Yelp message! 

""David S.
12 hours ago

Hi Sam,
This is David, your waiter who you skewered last year at Tommy V's.I have deliberated for some time about reaching out to you. I thought your yelp was pretty unfair to me and very unfair to the restaurant. You say in your profile that you don't waste a place for 1 bad meal or ""crappy "" waiter. Well, you did! I want to remind you that I asked if you and your dad were here with The Giants, I did not look at you as ""Country Bumpkins"". You kinda made that up to villainize me.At first I was upset over the calamari and your dad was nice about it. It was your choice to be upset. I tried to lighten up the mood with some levity and you chose to be offended. It is probably good that Yelping back at yelpers is not permitted. I have been serving over 40 years and your review was the nastiest I ever received""

I guess this place is cool with having their servers contact Yelpers regarding reviews! 

Original Review: 

Wow - what is it with all the love for this place? Have None of you been tot he Italian Grotto?

Maybe this is for the snooty eaters out there - because this place was awful to us. It was 2/3 empty and we get asked if we have a reservation - No, just walk ins... so they sit us right next tot he kitchen by where the waiters come in and out - easily the worst table in the restaurant, and they weren't even busy.

So, I haven't even noticed this when we order a calamari appetizer, which was recommended by apparent not very familiar with good food blogger Jaymee Sire (eisforeat.blogspot.com/2...)  I went with 2/4 of what she said to have - the chicken parm and the calamari. The calamari were terrible - I mean, what do we expect, fresh fish in Arizona must be something of an oxymoron...

So this is where things get interesting - the waiter asks us how our rubbery, tasteless calamari is - I being one who doesn't like to send food back tried to hide the truth, but the look on my dad's face was as if his only son came home to say he got an Al Qaeda male general pregnant and they weren't getting married... So the waiter grabs the plate before we can say anything to have them make another batch.. which we didn't want, and shocker, the second batch was even worse...

So at this point dad is furious, and yells at me for eating enough of the bad calamari creepy crawlers (the ones with tentacles are my favorite) so that he can't bitch at the waiter about how bad it was when he comes back.

The waiter takes away the app and comes back with the entrees - now we had ordered a pasta to share and two entrees, thinking he would brought them out for a pasta course then the main dishes - but it all came out at once. As he places the food down, Dad tells the waiter ""I've been punished before, it's OK, I get it,"" and I am part rolling my eyes part trying not to laugh.

That this waiter has looked us up and down as a couple of country bumpkins not realizing my dad is normally a 20-30% tipper, especially when on vacation with a roll of dough in his pocket. So then, to add insult to injury, this Artie Bucco wannabe comes back to check on how the entrees are then quips ""So I don't have to take these back? Enjoy!""

Well - Self Fulfilling prophecy jerk-wad - I would be nicer to customers based on how mediocre your food was - I am a Chicken Parmesan SLUT - I ate maybe 2/3 of it. The pasta bolognese? MEH... Dad unfortunately ordered fish for his main dish, which was again NOT fresh, so he pretty much at all the rest of the pasta t the table.

I will never go back here - give me the Italian Grotto every day, where the food is better, the servers have personality, and the food is amazing - strange how THEIR calamari tastes fresh..."
Negative	"The worse customer service I've had, the woman with the short hair working there was incredibly rude and screamed at me, I walked out immediately after her unprofessional scene.
I'm never coming back, and people if you're interested in beautiful art pieces go somewhere else in Montreal, maybe a place where they actually know how to treat people decently and respectfully."
Negative	"Terrible service! Host says 45 min wait. We ask if we can go around shop a little. She says be sure to come back in 30 min in case we are called earlier. So we come back in 25 minutes just to be safe only to be told we were put at the bottom of the list since they've already called us and we did not respond. SMH! When people are hungry 20 minutes and 45 minutes make a huge difference! 
This girl need to go back to first grade and be taught how to tell time."
Negative	This place is brand new really close to my house I love the food but they're never consistent , The soda machine is always out of soda .. out of coleslaw!! There still NEW  hopefully they will work out the kinks
Negative	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I come to Vegas atleast 6 times a year and first time staying at the MGM Grand. When I get into my room start to take a shower someone else is entering the room. They double booked the room. I then go down to the casino play for a bit return back to my room and my keys don't work. Have to walk down the mile long hallway back to the front desk complain they give me a new key and they say we are sorry for the embarrassment we will comp ur parking a whole $10.00. I will never stay here again this place sucks.
Negative	"This place is ok if you're in Richmond Hill and you don't really know where else to go.  it does tick me off that they charge cover on the weekends and it is a PUB.  Where are you? New York???

Never tried the food.  Bouncers pretty well suck."
Negative	"Ah, Iguana Mack's. There are so many words that are on the tip of my tongue, but they are far too explicit for a virgin yelper's eyes, so I shall opt for the ""sugar-coating"" route.

If you are a fellow Chandler resident, you can truly empathize with the fact that there aren't many bars to choose from (atleast, not to my knowledge). Being a closet alcoholic, I want to choose a bar that's atleast within a ten mile radius so I can sober up, and drive home without attracting a cop's attention. (Warning: Do not attempt to try at home.) Occasionally, when Tempe seems miles away, and Scottsdale isn't even an option, I go to Iguana Mack's with my friends.

The first time, I had a joyful experience. The bar was packed, the alcohol was flowing through my bloodstream, the packed, small dance floor seemed appealing, and the liquor impaired my taste in men and dancing partners. However, when I decided to go to Iguana Mack's again, I realized how horribly slow the service is, and how inattentive the bartenders are. I decided that it was endurable, and decided to give Iguana Mack's another shot - I adamantly believe in equality and justice.

Can I say RUDE, RUDE, RUDE? Horrible, horrible service. The food is mediocre, at best. I suppose when you're boozing, you aren't overly particular about your choice in foods. I would have had an alright time if it weren't for the rude servers.  Other than that, this place is happening, by Chandler standards...it's densely packed on Thursday nights. However, I'd rather risk a couple more miles and go to Maloney's in Tempe."
Negative	"Disappointed,had a reservation, showed up only to be informed given to someone else, what is a ""reservation"" ? Directed to another location, why? Eric didn't even bother to look at me just stared at the computer while Kris explained, you didn't call so it's gone, would you like another size unit? explained was working couldn't return call, as I walked out then told me to have a good day...what bad customer service. Luckily there other choices out there,who would value a potential customer."
Negative	"VERY Disappointed. 
This is an updated review. I would take back my my previous 5-star review posted a year ago. 
 
I placed an order from Ubereats around 7:15pm, then the APP notified me at 8:00pm that the order got cancelled.

During these 45 minutes, I heard NOTHING from the restaurant, not even an Explanation. I wouldn't even find out if it wasn't the app notification. I could have ordered from another restaurant if they told me ahead of time.

I tried twice to call them, and finally the owner picked up the phone said she cancelled it bcuz they were too busy and couldn't prepare my food, not showing a slightest bit of regret that they value their customers. It took them 45 MINUTES to realize that they were too busy to prepare 2 stews and 1 Japchae, what a joke.

I've been to this restaurant since their first day opened, I ate in the restaurant and ordered from ubereats/foodora thousands of times, referred my friends and family to come, rated them high on social media cuz at the beginning they were doing a great job but not many people came and I'd love to see them survive in the neighborhood. 

Now I'm really disappointed. Such a waste of time."
Negative	"Some barber named Marcus just gave me the worst haircut of my life. I'm so fucking pissed. I'm a female. I told him to leave my length in the top and take the sides down. I even showed him a picture. That asshole cut all my length off the top. The cut looks nothing like the picture and I had more length than the girl in the picture. I'd give this place a -5 stars. I wish I would have never walked in this place.

Ok, I came home and picked my hair out. This haircut is worse than I thought. Marcus's excuse for chopping my length was, "" It's all the same length now "". Really, Marcus? Really? I don't think any of my hair is the same length. 

I'm pulled my hair and put twist in some pics trying to show the various lengths he gave me. That fool actually cut the front center so short I can barely catch it to twist it. While the front left and right of center are at least 1.5 inches. That's approximately 1/3 of what my length was when I walked into the shop. He had the nerve to have an attitude when I got upset. Maybe, someone can tell me WTF?
Does Marcus really have a Barber license? Anyone that knows the owner, tell him/her I was to speak to them. This is straight bullshit. Did I say I'm pissed? Cut all my muthafuckn hair off for this bullshit.

Update 
On 9/23/17
I noted Marcus, the Barber who hacked my hair off posted he found it ""funny"" under my review. Now, I see Marcus has removed his comment. However, I'm attaching a screenshot of the comment in my pictures to show everyone what type of person he is. This Barber will do whatever he wants to your hair and laugh in your face. Now, he is attempting to erase the evidence of his behavior. 

On 9/26/17
The business has ignored my requests for information that would be on the licenses. They are required by law to display their license. I went to the shop to take a quick picture of the business and professional licenses. Marcus grabbed the frame with all of the licenses and took them to a back room before I could take the picture. They refused to allow me to view them. They kicked me out of the shop. 

I went to the Board and found some interesting information. 

In my opinion Marcus can not be trusted. I'm trying to save potential victims and stop him from thinking distressing clients is funny."
Negative	"Woof!!
I moved from the west coast and thought I needed to take visiting family members to try Primanti brothers. None of us liked it. I'm not sure why there are such high reviews. Skip Primanti and go to Gaucho Parilla for a good Sandwich."
Negative	If I could give no stars I would. I ordered a rocket blender for Christmas for my partner and when we opened it up 10 minutes ago, the motor didn't start, upon closer inspection we made the horrifying discovery that the blender had been used before, what looks like some sort of red juice is all along the edge of the motor and in the safety clasps, clearly someone had used the blender before a returned to the store where they have re sold. PLS everyone check anything you buy here they are re selling items returned and used by other buyers. Absolutely disgusted and you should be ashamed of yourselves
Negative	the absolute worst location ever! staff is uneducated and unknowledgeable, very rude and disrespectful! the is my local post office, but i'd rather drive across town for service than to ever return here! i've complained to consumer affairs regarding this location, they've lost and stolen packages ! if it were possible to not give a star at all they'd actually be in the negative
Negative	"I tried something new here. Some kind of crab soup. It was NOT good. I ended up not eating it. 

The second time I just got the pho. It was MEH. Nothing about it stuck out in my  mind. 
We came with a group of people. Two seconds after we sat down they asked Do you know what you want? Ummm, no not yet. Not more than a minute later two other servers asked us if we were ready... Ummm, could we have a little more time please?? Then when we were finally ready, we had to flag someone down. Not great customer service. They also put auto gratuity on our bill and didn't tell us so they ended up getting a double grat for not great service. 
I won't be back."
Negative	"If I could give a negative star rating I would.

The bus picked me up and arrived on time to Chicago. Still, it was 4 hours in a car, 1 hour of which we were circling campus picking up students. I was hesitant to embark on my journey back.

I bought my ticket the day of my return bus, and it stated the bus would arrive at 6:00 and drop us off at 8:45. The perfect time! It actually arrived at 6:10 due to bad weather (not a big deal), but then we started down I55 (not the way to campus). at 8:45 and nowhere near home, I asked the driver what was happening. He told me he isn't due in Champaign until 10pm. I told him he must be mistaken because my ticket said 8:45. He insisted he stopped at ISU first, then would proceed to Champaign. I was furious. I called customer service but they too told me that it was scheduled to come in at 10. It was as if no one was hearing me. I understood now that I would arrive at 10pm, but why did my ticket say I would arrive at 8:45? I would have never bought it otherwise. 

The girl on the phone, a minimum-wage worker, couldn't have cared less either. She said it was a new route, and told me to complain online to the owner, which I did in the morning (we got in at 10:30, 4.5 hours of driving on a bus, and I had such a migraine and had to go to work in the morning). I then get an automated response from Mr. Lex about buses being late. My bus wasn't just late, it was re-reouted at the confusion of its own passengers (I was not the only one confused about this timing, as others asked as well why were weren't home yet). 

I have traveled the world and even in developing countries the service is better, the rides are honest, and people seem to care. Not Lex. I will take Suburban express from now on, or, as I have been thinking about it for a while, buy a car (at least then I don't get charged a FUEL surcharge that goes up on the weekends, and a baggage fee. Who are they, the airport??)

If Lex cared at all, if the University of Illinois cared at all, it would shut down companies like LEX and CPM, THAT is what the Wall Street protesters are all about."
Negative	"Good selection of product but extremely poor customer service. Went in not knowing exactly what I was looking for and hoping to get some assistance from them, being that they are the experts. The employee that supposedly ""helped"" me was Felix Guy. Not very friendly at all. Never bothered to take me out and show me the product to help me make a decision. It was close to closing time so Im sure he didn't want to be bothered. I told him I wanted ""polished"" diamond plate. His response was, ""aluminum or steel?"" This led me to believe they both came polished. I told him, ""Im not sure which would be better for me, its for hauling my motorcycles"". He responds again, ""aluminum or steel"". Believing they were both polished, I said steel. I went out and handed the guys the sheet and told them what size I wanted it cut to. When they returned with the sheets they were bare blackish colored. I was told I had to take them and that they would not take them back by Felix Guy. He would not budge or work with me in any way shape or form. I would have given them
 one star but the guys loading up outside were pretty great but unable to help me as they are not the decision makers."
Negative	"I thought this place would be cool and hip judging from the pictures. The lobby is impressive. But the actual hotel (disconnected from the lobby area) is really just crap. It is definitely a ""lipstick on a pig"" scenario. Clearly an old dilapidated motel gussied up with bright colors in an attempt to make it seem modern and hip. But it has like no maintenance going on. Bright colors aren't as fun when the paint is way overdo for being redone. The bathroom tile and fixtures are disgusting. All sorts of drips and broken grout and air conditioning unit loud noises. Popcorn ceiling. Weird decor that can't quite decide what it wants to be - is it supposed to be ironic? Is it supposed to be retro? Is it supposed to be outdoorsy? It's just a lot of random elements and bright colors trying to hide the fact that you are indeed staying in an overpriced crap hole. And a 22 dollar resort fee? Outrageous. Stay away unless you get a real good special rate."
Negative	"I have wanted and wanted to try this place since I moved to the area.  Finally decided to go ahead and give it a go.  So, we walked in and got seated right away.  It was not busy at all, as it was 3:00 pm.  It took the waiter a longer-than-it-should-have-taken while to come and take our drink order. Quite a bit longer, he brings our drinks and a bread basket. We asked for extra butter. We order an appetizer and our entrees. Twenty minutes pass and we get the appetizer, which was delicious. We remind the waiter about the butter.  Several minutes later a different waiter brought another pat of butter.  Another 45 minutes pass and our entrees arrive. Everyone thought their dish was alright at best.  After we all stop eating it takes another 20 minutes for the waiter to return and ask about boxes and drops off the check (without asking about dessert).  Another 15 minutes later the waiter comes by and grabs the check.  He brings the credit slips back 5 minutes after.

From the time we entered the restaurant to the time we walked out the door, almost two hours had passed.  That is a long time to wait around for overpriced ""alright"" food. Especially when the waiter seemed to have absolutely no clue what he was doing."
Negative	"TERRIBLE!
I set up a car service for my boss's business meeting this past Monday. Tony said he would personally pick up my boss at baggage claim at the airport.  Tony never showed, never called to say he was running late, or that he was going to send someone else.  Nothing!!!  I was very upset, since my boss had to then find a cab in the long line of people that were also waiting outside the airport.  I tried calling Tony ALL DAY to try to find out what went wrong, but no one picked up the phone.  I called the next day... same thing.  I finally got a hold of him today he said he would call me back and still... I have not heard from him.  Very unprofessional!  DON'T USE THIS SERVICE IF YOU EXPECT TO BE SOMEWHERE ON TIME!"
Negative	I came to this place because i went to one in boston and had a great time....they are supposed to be rude to you and i understand that but my waitress was just horrible. we never got our drinks...our food was forgotten about and when i told her we never got our drinks or food after 45 minutes, she said well what do you want then. How about my food im paying for! Ugghhh i was so mad and i will never go back there again.
Negative	"I have been here many times in the last few years, as well as gotten take-out from this location. I have never been so disappointed as tonight. Serrano's has never been ""super"" food wise, but has never been as poor quality as this. Completely greasy, half cooked, and tasteless. Inconsistent temperatures throughout food. More than 50$ for less than 2 meals (the only reason this rates 2 stars is because of the bean dip- still okay). Also we picked up the food. Five minutes from our house. I have always justified going to Serrano's because we like to support local businesses, family atmosphere, and usually decent food. Unfortunately they seem to have given up and don't care about their product or customers ."
Negative	"Brilliant!  Why'd I not thought of reviewing some of our wonderful local government entities?  Good thinking, Miles.

The Parking Authority (or Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh, PPAP) is pretty much the norm for Pittsburgh government: poorly run and really hard to deal with.  (I'm guessing corrupt, too, but that's conjecture.)  

A.) It's 2011.  Why can't I conduct business with them over the web?  Seriously?  I have to physically go in to their office with closing papers or a lease?  I can't even send a .pdf?  Are you kidding?  I guess Pittsburgh would prefer that its residents not have jobs so that they can spend their days dealing with the crappy hours and bureaucratic inefficiency that comes with trying to live in this dysfunctional city.  

B.) I had some contractors over, and I gave them my visitor's pass.  They still got harassed and ticketed until I called in for a waiver.  (Again, I can't do this online?  Really?  It was over the phone - they didn't need any proof of who I was or who the contractors were.  Good idea if you have friends staying long-term.)  When I did call in, all I got was an answering machine.  I left a message to call back, which didn't happen after 3-4 calls.  I finally received a return call after contacting my city councilman's office.  Message: PPAP doesn't work for Pittsburghers, but they move fast for city officials.

C.) Residential permits are required during daylight hours and not at night?  What other f'ing city does this?  Who cares if someone's parked in the neighborhood at noon?  The street's almost completely empty during the day.  Most of the ""hardworking taxpayers"" are at work then!  What's really annoying is when I come home late in the evenings and have to cruise around to find parking.  Lo and behold we run a residential program like most of the others I've seen that restrict parking from 6 or 7 in the evening until the morning.  (We know the real reason for that: the enforcement guys would have to work at night.)


One plus: Despite all of the systemic problems with PPAP, the two employees I've seen the two times I had to go in to the office were friendly in that weird, gruff Pittsburgh-friendly way.


Not that they're all that much better, but Fox Chapel and Cranberry look slightly appealing every time I interact with my city government."
Negative	"Like all the other reviewers have said, this place looks good when you walk in the door.  It's got a fresh feel and is relatively inviting.  The bar is well stocked and there is plenty of sunlight that beams into the restaurant through the massive wall of windows.

We stopped here for lunch after unsuccessfully finding the Dim & den sum truck in the area.  Let me start off by saying that the offerings on the menu look incredible.  I have found more restaurants recently with mediocre creativity displayed from their chefs.  You will not find that at Naya Bistro.  Most of the dishes have really interesting flavor combinations and there is an incredible a depth of vegetarian options that you simply don't find at many restaurants these days.  It is clear that the menu is well thought out, which I give props for.

The problem came with the execution of the food.  It took us a solid ten minutes to figure out what we were going to sample for our lunch.  My friend at lunch is a vegetarian, so he went with the Baked Eggplant with goat cheese and tomato puree to start.  I started with the Carpaccio Sushi with blue cheese and roasted peppers.  We decided to split the Mushroom Pita and Vegetable Burger since we were both interested in those dishes and the manager said that both were good sellers.

The eggplant dish was clearly marinated in some type of oil based marinade.  It arrived and looked nice on the plate, but had a very greasy feel.  The best bites are those that are completely loaded with tomato and goat cheese, otherwise it just tastes like some heavily oiled eggplant.  The tomato puree was under seasoned, probably intentionally since it would be expected to be eaten with the goat cheese which is naturally salty.  The goat cheese ran out before the eggplant or the tomato, so the last couple bites just tasted blah.

I was psyched for my Carpaccio Sushi.  It arrived looking great on a very cool plate which separated out the sweet soy.  There were six rolls on the plate.  I asked the manager for some chop sticks to which he replied that they had none, work it out with a fork.  Strange, right?  Buy some cheap chop sticks- the dish looked great, why tarnish it straight off the bat without the proper utensils?  Anyhow, that wasn't nearly the biggest issue with the dish.  It is made with what they call a wasabi risotto.  It was a risotto, but not wasabi and the rice was so undercooked that it was almost painful to eat.  The blue cheese was non-existent within the rolls.  I disassembled a roll just to see if there was blue cheese there, and rest assured there was not.  What happened here?  The concept is so cool, but the execution so poor.  What a disappointment.

Well, we were still looking forward to the pita and the veggie burger.  The manager told us that the burger was made in house, which is pretty cool.  Most restaurants simply use a Morningstar burger or something.  The plate showed up and the kitchen took the responsibility of giving each of us half a burger and half a pita.  The manager never asked what kind of fry we would like, so they gave us both sweet potato and regular fries.  The good news is that both types of fries were great.  The kosher salt on the sweet potato fries was just the right amount and the regular fries tasted like fair fries- really fresh.  

The veggie burger looked great.  You could see the broccoli and cauliflower in the patty itself.  There was what they called a spicy vegetable spread on the burger, but most of it was absorbed by the bun.  I scraped some off with my knife, it wasn't spicy at all.  The burger could have used a lot more of the spread though since it was dense and gummy.  The flavor was good, but it was sort of like eating vegetable spiked paste.  I was glad that we split the burger.  Eating a whole one would have been hard to do.  We were in agreement that this was a dish to pass on.

The moment of truth: the Mushroom Pita.  The manager said that this was one of the best selling dishes on the menu, literally flying out of the kitchen.  We asked him how he liked it and he replied that he was allergic to mushrooms.  Ok.  It is described as a braised mushroom stuffed pita with smoked gouda and crème fraiche.  The mushrooms tasted like they were canned.  You know, rubbery, flavorless and generally lacking in all respects.  The mushrooms were plated on top of the arugula, which sogged out into a watery green mess.  It said smoked gouda but was almost non-existent, so didn't add anything to the sandwich. The crème fraiche was just all right- it was really thick and tasted more like sour cream than crème fraiche.  After two bites of the sammy without the crème fraiche, I smothered it with the sauce and it was only marginally better.  

This restaurant should really have received one star based on the food that was delivered, but they are trying something that many other places won't even go near so I gave them a second star."
Negative	I would like to start by saying that I had a great initial meeting with Dr. Cry. She is very friendly. It was the follow up service that was beyond frustrating.  I was starting the family planning process after trying to get pregnant for 2 years.  I was treated like I was a very low priority.  The front staff was very dismissive when they called to cancel my follow-up blood work appointment 4 times.  I had blood work done in October, saw another specialist they referred me to in December.  My appointments were canceled in Feb, March, April and the last one in May.  My blood work was not even current at this point!  That was when I decided I was done with this clinic.  I am at the age that I have a very little window to get pregnant and they wasted about 8 months of that time.  Now that I have a new doctor and clinic I can tell you that this service of this clinic was so sub par.  I am not one to write reviews but feel like other women should be aware before they choose this clinic.  Especially if you have a small window of time to work with.
Negative	Market is ok but don't eat at the restaurant. Stopped by for quick lunch special, paid for 2 pcs. of beef with mushrooms and risotto on the side $16.94 (!), the meat was completely cold and risotto glued together like a ready-mix. Tavora probably never again.
Negative	I honestly cant believe I paid $30.00 for my lunch here today. I'm used to home made Italian food, so my standards may be a little high, but I would expect a place that specializes in meatballs to actually have good....uh...meatballs. I ordered the chicken meatballs and they tasted like theyd be sitting under a lamp. I expect this from mcdonalds, but I dont expect this when I'm paying 30.00 for my lunch. The meatballs were super dry, and if my 80 year old grandmother can make better meatballs something is wrong. The pasta came out cold, and the broccoli was under cooked. I shouldnt have to saw into my broccoli that Im cutting down a tree. The food wasnt the only problem. The wait staff was rude,the busboy kept giving me dirty looks because I have my 11 month old son with me in the high chair. Of course he was getting food everywhere, but I fully intended on cleaning up after him. I didnt appreciate the death looks while I was eating. Get over it, it's a shopping mall that your customers are coming from, there will be babies. Just hope you get the moms like me that clean up after there kids. Im really mad to that after we paid my friend was feeding her baby and they took all our drinks away and everything out from under us without even asking, as if to say get the f out. Excuse us for taking an extra fifteen minutes. Your restaurant was empty, nobody was waiting. To top it off, one of the waiters tells us that their restrooms dont have changing tables and to go somewhere in the mall to change them. Then we walk back to their bathrooms and there is a changing table. Im pretty sure the people at this place just hate babies. Which I can respect the fact for a nice evening meal maybe not bring babies, but it was 2pm and lunch time. This place is horrible compared to the other restaurants that are available in the same location. Say no and walk over to Yardhouse.
Negative	"this is the letter I sent to the casino manager and food and beverage manager:

I just completed a 2 night stay at your Hotel. It was a memorable stay but for all the wrong reasons. I got there early and was allowed to go to my room earlier than the 4pm check-in time.SO that was nice. However I noticed things after looking around that were not the best, Room 526 had a huge seam in the carpet that shows it needs replacing as well in the far corner of the room it looked as if someone deficated in the corner was wiped up not actually cleaned. The bathroom looked to have tile missing around the toilet.

Beyond that my food and beverage experience was equally disappointing. Seeing as this was the basis for the company it really saddened and quite frankly made me angry. First off on Thursday at midnite...Primetime for casinoes, there were 2 servers for the casino floor. 2 SERVERS!! The tables were full and the back where the machines were while not as packed still had people there. At the next table there were guys complaining receiving drinks for an hour!! The girls were being yelled by the patrons because of slow orders. Even one of the pit supervisors acknowledged that they had to wait that long. THAT IS INEXCUSABLE!!! I never got my drink and told the bartender that I was leaving to go to the Tropicana to play and maybe get a drink or two.That was Thursday.

Friday night the drink situation was better but still could be improved. However when I decided to get a late night bite and go to the restaurant, I took a spot at the bar. I sat there checked out the menu and figured someone would be along to get the order. The couple next to me had finished and one the bartenders gave them their check, it got paid and the bartender went on her merry way. Meanwhile I am still sitting there not being served. After 10 minutes of waiting at a half full bar, I am finally acknowledged by a busser, I ask the busser for a manager and explain to the manager the situation of my waiting and his only solution was to do a drink order. Not happy and that was Friday.

On Saturday. I go and find out I have enough points for a meal so I decided to try again and get food. Get sat and acknowledged this time, but this time I am near a bussing/drink station. The staff was going back and forth regarding a lack of coffee available. AT 9AM!! And what I was hearing was not fun as both the bussers and waitresses were giving major attitude towards each other.

I myself am in the travel industry and am in a leadership position. I know when my agents go out to deal with the public that they are on stage at all times. And if there is a breakdown its not only a reflection on them but the company they represent. You have a chance to save your image and save business by addressing these issues. As far as I am concerned even though I am a budget minded consumer, I will add to my budget if it means no longer staying at your property,"
Negative	"This review covers only the produce section of the market.

Don't bother buying your produce here.  Yes the prices are good but it is dimly lit and I made some regrettable purchases.  The fruit and veg look like they are the castoffs from the worst No Frills.  I couldn't find a single red or orange bell pepper that didn't have a grey dint in it (you know the kind that would quickly morph to a rotten spot).  Half of the eggplants I brought home had to be trimmed to get rid of the questionable not so fresh bits.  The bananas tasted fine but the outside had an unattractive grey tinge. The beets were fine.  The one high-light was the giant asiatic flat bread seasoned with nigella which was excellent once toasted.

I only went here because I was already at Downsview park shooting a freezing cold university field hockey game in the SNOW on October 31.  I should've just cut my losses and gone home right after."
Negative	This place was my favorite about 6 months ago. I don't know why they have stopped serving fresh food though. I usually order rice noodles and spring rolls.  Upon my last visit I was given rancid dipping sauce and old noodles. I didn't bother to eat the food because I didn't want to get sick. Hopefully the management can do right by this place and bring it back to life.
Negative	We stopped here to grab a bite while we waited for our flight. The seating was packed, though the food was pretty quick to be prepared. The pizza...nothing to brag about. It was basically the same as eating a frozen pizza, but marked up in price and with a few spices added on top. The sauce and crust were bland and unremarkable.
Negative	Shwappy food. First time here and my last. Save your $15 and go to Chipotle. My burrito was beans and lettuce, maybe 10 little pieces of chicken. Paid .50 cents for sour cream lol. All you can eat tortilla chips with your meal?! No way!
Negative	If you need any cosmetic or restorative work done do not go there. I had Dr Stevens do 6 front crowns years back. I was dumb didn't do my research and that ruined my face forever. The crowns didn't feel and look right from the start. But Dr Stevens refused to ignoledge and fix that insisting I needed to get used to them. Followed by years of gums problems, crowns falling off inexpectedly in public on from teeth, and now due to poor design and placement I permanently lost one of my front teeth because it kept snapping off. It cost me thousands to fix ongoing problems with crowns and I am still in pain and misery. I'm sure they are just fine doing routine cleanings and fillings but DO NOT let them do any cosmetic of major restoration work. I wish I was forwarded before going there.
Negative	Got our order wrong 5 times in one night! Apparently it's hard to read a monitor and follow what is listed. We paid $9 for 3 side items that were 1.49 a piece. We didn't realize we were over charged until we got home and looked at the receipt. Zero refund for their mistake. We will never go here again. HORRIBLE service.
Negative	"Hello This place is terrible! I made the mistake of going there Recently for my fav grower CANNIBIOTIX well i bought a quarter for 70 of WhiteWalker og, sounds good right? it sells for 55 an eitgh...... well first the budtender was so rude and annoying, she even said they get bad reviews and when I said that I read them she asked why did i come here,,say wha????? when I asked why the sample she had me smell was the actual Flower I was going to purchase... I said "" No no no little miss you walk your happy ass over there and fetch me two fresh 8ths, I didnt understand they dont sell sealed flowers! big RED FLAG, she assured me it was cannibiotix ,  well it wasnt it was dry and didnt smell or taste good and didnt get me blown at all, I called to confront them and was met with a voicemail, Heres the only good part, I was able to speak with a customer service Angel named ashley ,, boy was she smart,funny,knowledgeable, and most of all real!! she told me Sorry and she would personally speak with the little B and to top it off since i wasted 70$ she said i could come pick up ANY gram of my choice, and since i suffer from leg pain she made a great recommend for me...... So guess what I went in there the next day to claim my Gram and was met with another dork budtender who kept calling me ""Bro"" after I set him straight that i WAS ONLY THERE TO GET MY free G and a two dollar lighter he was extremely Rude and unpersonable and went and got the crap manager who said right infront of me ya this dude aint gettin nothing if he aint buying and i told him exactly what Ashley told me, and addressed him personally so he could stop acting like a little girl, and then i looked at there dry herbs and said I want what was recommended to me, so he went and got girly boy or his name is actually Richard and little rich told me i could only pick from the lowest level of Grams.....wowwwww Ashley literally recommended me this stuff because it is strong in pain reliever Ok i played his little game and picked out high roller witch was recommended to me by the ""bud""tender, well guess what he said they only had eitghs so i picked sfv og, little dork went right back and told me they didnt have that, i asked for one more and ....... catching a pattern here? dorkus told me they didnt have grams of that either..... thats when i said get your Manager little bro, Third time I had to speak with this ""MANAGER"" Richard , he once again told me ashley was misinformed and i could only recieve Gold so I SAID NO RICHARD, i was recommended Rose and thats what im getting pointed to it and once again explained what product was recommended to me and thats what i meant to get, he eventually caved and let me get it after arguing with me and making me look like a stupid begger, tourists with money were looking at me like desperate crackhead as i wear business slacks polo and gold watch, So anyways I phoned Ashley the next day and she called me back and told me no I was supposed to pick from ANY Gram of my choice and apologized and said she would speak with Richard, 20 mins later the phone rings and its Rich with his ""apology"" I humored him at first and told him how I was there on business and knew what I  wanted and didnt appreciate having to debate him or push for what I needed, He proceeded with what sounded like an ernest apology but after he accused me of trying to abuse there system and take advantage I just lost it, Told him he had no right to call me and I didnt appreciate him calling and would only like a manager or someone higher up to contact me,,, I hung up on him and Ashley called back and said she thought i may have appreciated his call my phone died and I thought I would just let it be.... I wasnt going to review but I honestly feel the budtenders and sales floor associates there are very rude and could care less about the customer, I dont know how these people get these jobs and then i realized... people with heart or passion or general wellness of othesr being a concern is absolutely  not wanted, they need people that are  entry level, have no problem saying No, Have a false sense  of ""status"" and PotHead, I honestly think having potheads doing this job is horrible they are stupid, entitled, and ignorant people that lack Integrity, and also big Marijuana kind of lacks integrity, and it shows in the business practices, they have something you want and only care about the money thats all, and not a quality product, neither do the growers there are pushing this stuff out as fast as they can to keep up with demand, So if you must Smoke the Dank i say Go to Essence, the dispensary or mmj arent bad but Trust.... You can go to Essence and get Real Canniobiotix premium shelf in its original package, or desert grown farms, they also have a great top shelf for budget friendly but also not skimping u on quality, they give 10 percent local program and the loyalty program is actually worth something, First thing is REEFbadFlowerBadEmplyeesBADBADBADBAD"
Negative	"went to toast for brunch a few weeks ago and was sorely disappointed. while the food was delicious and the restaurant itself was quaint, our server seemed burdened and annoyed by our very presence. we were rushed, ignored, and generally mistreated in a way that ensures we won't be returning. 

we walked into a fairly empty restaurant, 2 of us to start, and mentioned that we would be between 3 and 5 people in total. our server rolled her eyes and asked if it would be 3 or 5. we reiterated that we weren't sure but wanted to sit somewhere big enough for 5. rather than accommodate us, we were sat at a table for 2 and were moved to a larger table once other friends started showing up. 

every item we ordered/request we made was met with an eyeroll or expression of contempt from our server. i ordered an item they'd run out of and was told ""you can't have that, it's out."" server didn't make any alternative suggestions. one member of our party arrived right as brunch ended, and was told with a great deal of attitude that their food options would be limited since they ""came too late."" again, they weren't busy, so i don't know if she was having a bad day or just hates her job, but we were treated so poorly that most of the afternoon was spent trying to laugh off and forget about our awful brunch experience. 

i'm not one to complain to management since i've worked in the industry and know everyone has their bad days--however, i wish i had mentioned something before leaving. definitely won't return. there are too many great brunch places in Cleveland to settle for subpar service and feeling unwelcome."
Negative	This place just. Keeps getting worse by the day! Told myself I wouldn't be back cause the service was awful.  Then they somewhat took care of that only to make this IRISH BAR the least IRISH BAR in town.  Here's a suggestion....if you call yourself an IRISH BAR, how about some authenticity?? Your bands are terrible and your food is anything I can find at any dive bar.  You guys should be ashamed to call yourselves an Irish pub.  Just close down already and make room for anything else that will surely be better than you
Negative	"The Maids are a continual disappointment. They are difficult to work with on scheduling. They are very destructive (they completely gushed a custom made dining room table that was built to fit the room. Their only solution was to send the table out to repair (not a possibility). They have repeatedly scratched the walls and the woodwork. When we try to tell them to be more careful they don't seem to care at all about all the marks they put in the wall. They only do a mediocre job of cleaning. Today, one lady came to me to tell me that there was water pouring down through the lights in my kitchen. I walked up to my bedroom to find an empty bucket sitting next to a huge puddle on my carpet. I asked the lady if she spilled it and she kept saying no. I tried to call the manager and was told there was only a customer service rep (the person I was talking to) and nobody higher within the company. She said we could get someone out to look at our electrical system and carpet / floor but we had to handle it all ourselves. While I was in my office trying to handle it, they left without finishing the job or any word or notification that they were leaving. They literally left my kitchen chairs strewn around the kitchen. This is the worst customer service in the history of any company!  Do not use The Maids if you value your house. 

In response to your post,  
Everything written was brought up to your team or higher. Everything. 
As stated, the table was custom built in the room it is in. It cannot be carried out to fix which was the only option given by your company that you offered to fix it. There were multiple witnesses to the bucket of water. The scratches on the stairs were brought up to the team leader on 3 occasions. The incident about the dog was brought up (through broken speech because I was crying through it - but she absolutely understood) to the team leader. There were more minor things, but honestly too many to recall."
Negative	Used to be Little Cottonwoods and things were tended to. Now, they let the garbage pile up and it is completely disgusting. Lost the best maintenance staff and down to only 3 guys. Need more staff for maintenance.
Negative	"This was a horrible experience staying at the Luxor Hotel Casino. To discover on my 3rd night and many bites and hours of not sleeping because of bedbugs , that I found un my room under the mattress.
I'm still here for 1 more day. And hotel did no even apologized. 
This hotel should not even be a 1 start hotel.."
Negative	Slowest Wendy's in the history of Wendy's. It's so close to my house and easy to get to but literally the worst customer service around. I refuse to go there anymore because I will be in the drive thru for a minimum of twenty minutes. Be warned.
Negative	"Worst steak I have ever had at a ""nice"" steakhouse. In fact, most steaks I order at Texas Roadhouse are better than the over-cooked piece of meat they called a filet. They agreed to cook a new one, but we were in a hurry and did not want to wait. Had some crab with my steak that was wonderful so I concentrated on that for my meal. Very disappointed and will never return given the many dining options in Las Vegas."
Negative	I'm not sure why University audio gets such high reviews. Every time I go in there I get the feeling the owner wants me to go somewhere else. If I ask him a simple question about a product he sells he goes into a rant about how people come in and have him demo for them and then they go out and buy it somewhere else. THAT IS NOT ME! I have bought from him before and he should not treat me this way. The main reason I ask him questions it to develop a working relationship with him. If he would respond in kind he would sell more to me. I have money to spend he is making a BIG mistake! I feel he owes me an apology for the way he treated me the other day. I came in specifically to look at the new McIntosh phono preamp. It sells for $2,000.00. It's new so there are no used ones out there yet. When I buy one I will be paying $2,000.00 for it. I would prefer to buy it locally. However, if the owner is going to continue to treat me like he does I will buy it from somewhere else & he has nothing to bitch about if I do.
Negative	If you don't know anything about soul food, it tastes good. If you've had real home cooked soul food and are looking to replicate the experience, this is not the place to go. On the contrary, the staff was friendly and approachable.
Negative	The white girl with the weak ass bun on her head and looks like she's on crack is rude AF! Your front desk so suck up your attitude and try talking to the patient next time
Negative	"I went there for a cleaning and they tried to rip me off (although I have insurance) with a $380 (out of my pocket because the insurance doesn't cover of course )  ""laser crap"" because I needed it for my gums .. Plus the other crap they tried to sell you .. Later I said ""can I just get my cleaning and not get laser?"" , which I did and it was ""only"" $120 plus I got charged $52 a week after for who knows what .. The cleaning was awful , I have gotten cleaning service before and trust me , my teeth were not cleaned well . She took less than 5 min , there's no way she got all my teeth , all they did was put anesthesia on my gums . Don't go here , waste of $$$ . 
Johanna W."
Negative	Bad service. Water took 20mins and if i didnt go to the cashier to ask for water, we wont be getting water. And its CASH ONLY! Food was bad. Wasnt even that busy, servers acted like it was!
Negative	This place is a joke. There is nothing resort like about it. The organization has been pathetic, the rooms  are less than impressive and you are by nothing interesting. Don't waste your time. Save your money up and go to your local holidays inn cause it is no different. Anybody that even for a second considers buying a time share here is off their rocker.
Negative	I went shopping here over the holidays. I really like Winners clothes and I generally have success in my shopping however this time we had a mystery shopper follow us all around the store until we left, they pretty much treated us like criminals! We had no privacy to shop. I wont be going back for a while....
Negative	I've never seen such a bad repair shop. In charge of 5 s mouth！Close at 7. Accept me 75. 6:50 points said to change batteries. I call 75 again! Of course I won't. I just bought a battery online. Complete the boot found charging mouth still doesn't work! Cell phone also found a less parts. In the past, looking for the boss. Leave what all not. Shit
Negative	"I have to say that I was really looking forward to living near this place.  We came here and got a small chocolate scoop in a cone and a order of 'large family"" fries.  The total was 8.50. When the food came the fries were barely a small, obviously frozen and not tasty.  the cone was small and not worth almost 4 dollars.  The AC was not working on the inside and it was too hot to sit outside.  It was the opposite of a good ice cream night with the family experience.  I will not be coming back.  Java Cat is just a few blocks away and much tastier."
Negative	"Absolutely sub-standard. Not even a fortune cookie with lunch.

We order the Jakarta Satay w/ noodles. Over drenched in sauce..not the least bit spicey, and next to no meat or vegetables...mainly noodles.

Many other chinese places in the are would be better than this."
Negative	This is the worst Chipotle I have ever visited. The food was ok, the workers are fine, the building is awful though. Would not mind if the place burned down. It is too small for the customer base. Furthermore, the men's restroom is locked with a keypad. God forbid you should have to wash your hands after eating a messy burrito. I would not recommend supporting this location unless serious changes are made to their facilities.
Negative	I came to have a drink before my flight and sat at the bar. The bar had open seats so I moved one out of the way so I could put my laptop and cary on next to me. A lady came out and told me I could not move the empty chair and must either put my cary on behind me or on the other side of the walkway. Either way I could not see my stuff and someone could easily walk away with it.  I am giving it 1 star for the service and hopefully the food will be decent, so one star for that.
Negative	Our experience there yesterday was horrible. Management need to get their act together. Only two staff members to run the whole place. They were doing the best they could, but come on. The lady running the register, bar, and food service was obviously overwhelmed. It's too bad. They have a nice facility but they need more staffing. Quit being cheap and schedule more people.
Negative	I would have to say first that this place is a complete disaster. We arrived at 4:30 the place was buzzing with staff. I would say so much staff that you would think that we would get five star service. There were cooks walking around there were people in street clothes walking out of the kitchen the manager was walking around and we still waited at least seven minutes before somebody came and took our order. It was so bizarre all of the staff walking back and forth and back and forth it was completely weird. I get it we were there early and they were probably preparing for their night but honestly it was so uncomfortable eating with so many people walking past the booth past the booth.  The food was what you would expect from a chain the filet had absolutely no flavor. We are locals we had a gift card and we will not return,
Negative	"I gave them two stars for effort, I'll never come back as a paying customer nor recommend it as a great place to eat until sweeping changes are made. I realize there might be a difference from one location to another, though I will not spend my money finding out.
I'll start off with what i liked. There is a minimalist inspired though pleasing decor, I enjoy that they are conscientious people with good hearts, offering lots of information (though bordering on propaganda: they use photos of 'famous veg people' on the walls) on the benefits of vegan/vegetarianism, and the menu is a refreshing alternative to mainstream food in America. I am a long-time vegetarian and pro-conscious eating advocate. 
Here's what i did not like. Terrible customer service, highly overpriced for what you actually get (not only do the menu photos not match what shows up on the table, the dishes are mostly carbs unless you order a complete veggie dish), an annoying television replaying the same programming, plain/bland food pairings (do NOT order the guru rice--it will only 'teach' you that you made a mistake) and an upcharge for any modifications to your dish: like a whopping $1.25 for brown rice. When I approached the counter the girl at the register was loudly huddled with 2 other employees and was more concerned with handling another issue than with taking my order, and then explained what she was doing instead of taking my order. Unprofessional from the start. I was told when I got seated that there were free refills on my green tea, which I was happy to hear; that is, until it took about 30 mins for me to even catch an employee's eye before they approached and asked if everything was ok. I had to ask for a refill as no offer was made. 
I was highly disapponted overall, as I have even visited this location once before and had an amazing first meal and experience. I was hoping that would be replicated; the letdown is real. I would have given this place ONE star if they didnt at least have their hearts in the right place."
Negative	"Updated as I was left a note that customers are taken in the order that the computer informs them to:  Please note that this was not the issue. Issue one was that an employee was handling personal phone business.  Issue two...an elderly couple coming in, looking for help and being met with a rude employee.  I spoke up at one point because it was clear that they weren't understanding what they needed to do because it wasn't being explained.  Final issue...making me wait because an employee is handling personal business while at work.  A brother, cousin, relative of some kind came in talking with the employee about another relative's car title...an extension of the personal phone call.  Personal business should be handled in personal time.  As a supervisor in my agency, this is something that would be unacceptable from one of my employees.  


I haven't been here for more than 5 minutes and am writing this review...which should tell you something.  Upon walking in, the employee was on a personal phone call while shoving snacks in her face.  I had to wait for her to stop chewing before she could address me.  She then told me I needed t wait and that she would be with me in a minute.  This was fine since i arrived early for my appointment.  She finished up her personal business and seemed to be preparing to meet with me when another customer came in.  She took care of this individual's needs as I continued to sit.  They have a fish tank that I pray houses no fish, considering that it is green and hasn't been cleaned in God knows how long.  It smells in here because of it.  Unless you need to come here for fingerprints and can only use this location, don't."
Negative	"I really, really wanted to like this place.  I've had amazing Peruvian food before, and was so excited to find out about Nazca.  But unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with my experience here.

We'll start with the good - because there really were a lot of good things!  Our waitress was very friendly and enthusiastic.  We did not experience the long wait for food that others have mentioned.  The restaurant was clean, easy to find (big signs on both the front and side of the building), and I liked the Nazca artwork.  Food-wise, my pisco sour and our appetizer (Causa Rellena de Pollo - we had the tuna, not chicken) were both outstanding, and everything we got was beautifully presented.  Also, the hot sauce is legitimately hot.

But sadly that was all over-shadowed by the bad.  I'd say my number one complaint is the pricing.  I thought the prices online were pretty high, but I had a Groupon (paid $15 for a $30 credit), and was willing to pay a little extra for the unique experience.  But then the prices in the restaurant were all higher even than what's on the website!  For example, I had the Chupe de Cameron, which was a large bowl of soup with 4 shrimp in it, and it was $13.99!  If you're going to charge $14 for a bowl of soup, it had better be some magical soup (actually the best soup of my life was a seafood soup I had in Lima, which is why I was willing to give this $14 soup a shot), and this was not even good.  It could have been good, but it was so salty that my salt-loving husband couldn't even finish it.  My next biggest complaint was that food came out not as described on the menu.  This is a  HUGE deal for me - I don't understand why restaurants think they can just swap out an ingredient and people won't notice.  It was especially problematic that they substituted chicken for beets in the otherwise vegetarian Palta Rellena con Ensalada Russa.  Aside from the potato appetizer, the food ranged from too salty (the soup) to boring (Arroz con Mariscos), and just wasn't good enough to justify the expense.  

Also, the restrooms aren't actually inside the restaurant, but out in the lobby, which is fine.  Except that there were no lights on in the lobby, and it was so dark that I couldn't  even see the sign indicating which door was the bathroom.  Hopefully this was a fluke, but it didn't do anything to help my experience.  

As sad as it makes me, I can't imagine going back."
Negative	Went for half-priced wings on Thursday and it was really sub-par service. I'm not sure if it's always like that, but when we went, it was 3:30pm and fairly empty. Our server didn't come by to greet us or offer us water/drinks for almost 15 minutes. The wings themselves could have been better. I don't generally have wings, I prefer them to be boneless, but my friends like wings and they found that St. Louis, Wild Wings and All-Star Wings were a degree above. I ordered the boneless wings with sweet and spicy Thai chilli and BBQ apple butter sauces. The wings had too much batter and over fried. It was a so-so experience.
Negative	"I just checked in for a conference next door @ the Aria. I chose to stay at the Vdara since it was a non-gaming hotel. Actually the hotel is beautiful....staying up on the 45th floor. When traveling, I require reasonable Internet performance allowing me to accomplish my work through different unified  communications modes (e.g. Skype, Cisco Jabber, Virtual Desktop, etc...) When I checked in, I paid a $20-25 per day use fee for certain amenities to include WiFi or direct connection. When I logged in, to call home via Skype, my connection was pixelated and choppy and it finally locked up. I was having flashbacks to the old dial-up days. I complained to the front desk and they referred me to Internet support. They also discounted my first day for the trouble. I am here for a week....in work mode. I called the Internet support folks and they had me run Speedtest.net to get a measurement. It was rated as a letter grade of ""F"" comparing to other hotels in the area. The technician advised that this speed was normal and was not surprised. I am now told if I pay and ""additional fee"", they can give me faster service. I am very surprised at all this. We are in the middle of the year of 2013. Wow...

**UPDATE**

Dining experience in the Vdara ""Market Cafe"" quickly went awry when my wife and daughter ate breakfast on 16 May 2013. This horrible customer experience was caused by what appeared to be a mop string embedded in my daughter's eggs. It seemed to take an eternity to resolve by staff with my wife's and daughter's insistence that this was not normal. They were given a $50.00 gift certificate to buy more Vdara ""FOOD"" and a bowl (about the size of a dessert dish) of fruit I wouldn't give to a monkey. As ""consolation"", the food service manager told us the string was actually used to tie off sausage......whatever... See pictures @ http://www.flickr.com/photos/hdryder/sets/72157634025082695/"
Negative	Terrible and not recommended. Surprised they are still in business. My biggest complaint is that they do not wear gloves and DO NOT USE SOAP AFTER HANDLING OTHER PEOPLES FEET!!!  Super unsanitary!!  Not enough staff on hand so they shuffle around between clients. Never experienced such a spectacle and plan to never experience this again. Regret not checking Yelp before going here!
Negative	Over priced.   Room temp (warm) drink. Wish menu would say that it was room temp.  100+ degrees out... drink should be cold.  Cucumber citrus drink tasted okay but lacked refreshing quality.  Will not go back.
Negative	In the past I have loved mimis Cafe mainly because the consistency in their food and Staffing. Saddens me to have a French dip that felt like it pretty chewed. Our waitress was terrible and had some attitude that she carried with her. I was a server at Mimi's and I know there regulations. The server never checked with us again to see how our food was and continue with the rude Behavior. I rarely never leave a tip but this time I did not. Would have mentioned something to the manager that was nowhere to be seen.
Negative	"To be sure, an impressive property -- in fact, it's really TOO big.  Suites are really pretty cool and well appointed. Housekeeping was huge disappointment (asked twice to have feather pillows removed...they never were) as, surprisingly, was checkout (I suggested that  the housekeeping staff be notified of their oversight which I had asked twice to have remedied; the agent suggested I just call again next time...making it my fault that something requested twice at a premium priced resort wasn't done).

I'd stay again, but would make fully sure that things like this were addressed.

(Note: the hotel did remove my resort fee for the trouble)."
Negative	"Noisy, Bad service, average food.

I have read fantastic reviews about Raku. 

My experience was almost bad. 
I asked for the sushi menu, and the waitress almost got angry at me as if I have had committed a crime. And told me that they don't serve sushi.

I ordered their special tofu. They say it's simply amazing.
I found it to be the most normal tofu in the world. Tasteless, unless you add spices and sauces and dressings and condiments. And only then it tastes ALMOST tasteless.

I have ordered crispy asparagus. Good. Not great. 

I have ordered their Green Tea Creme Brulèe. Delicious. But I still wonder why someone would put some whipped cream over it, which I have never seen before in such desert and I hope I won't ever see it again.

I ordered a cup of tea. It was way overdone, bitter. 

The waitress didn't speak english too well and didn't try to make herself understood. Same thing with the manager. The waitress cleaned my table after several minutes after retiring the plates, so there was soy sauce all over it, as it kept being even after she partially cleaned the table. 

I won't go back."
Negative	"Omg! Gross!
We ordered pizza and chicken wings, we noticed that one of the workers who turns out to be the manager is wearing a bandage wrapped around her hand (Rita). We continued watching her go from the register to prepping Pizza.

I asked her why she was prepping food without a glove. She said ""well I have a bandage it's better than the open wound"".

She claimed that she had been watching her hands all day long. However her bandage looked filthy on the bottom.

It was a Coban wrap.. by the way it looked, there was no way she had even washed her hands with that wrap.

 We asked her why she wouldn't wear a glove and she said she didn't think it was mandatory.

I hope no one gets sick from eating there. We got our money back and couldn't get out of there fast enough! Gross gross gross!"
Negative	Staff is very rude & unprofessional. Jaime never knows how to answer a question, JJ & Allison are both assholes. They will scam you out of your money and hang up in your face when you call to inquire about the process of what is going on.
Negative	You had one job! Everything bagel, that's it. No butter, no cream cheese. What do I get, a plain bagel globbed with Cow teet curds spread on top. Not only that but it took 10 minutes for this disaster of an order to come out which already stressed me for time. This is not the first time either. Last time we ordered a vegan burrito and there was bacon in it. When I called to get my money refunded the kid on the phone blamed it on the kitchen which I call BS. I 'sipped' but I spit that ish back out.
Negative	"My boyfriend & I just moved here from California, got in to our new home at around 2 am. I was looking for GOOD food open in the middle of the night. I found RePetes on line & the reviews made me willing to make the 30 min round trip to get food from there. I ordered my boyfriend a breakfast burrito, which on the menu there was NO mention of it including onions which my boyfriend is allergic to. When I got home my boyfriend opened his burrito to find it FILLED with onions. I called RePetes & spoke with Josh, who has originally taken my order. He apologized profusely & offered to remake it for free if I came back. I was so tired I didn't want to waste another 30 minutes driving around, so I asked for a refund that I would come in for later. Josh said he'd have to get the refund approved by his manager & if for any reason it wasn't approved, he said he would refund me out of his own tips. A few days later I went back in, ordering another breakfast burrito, assuming that it would be comped. When I arrived Josh recognized me right away. He started to tell me that he asked the chef & he said he never put onions in my burrito & they don't even come on it.... Basically like I'm an idiot & don't know what an onion looks/smells like, and he argued with me for about 5 minutes over whether or not the onions were actually in there or not! Then he tells me ""the chefs human to, we all make mistakes"" Really!?!? & then when I asked if I could get the burrito comped, he tells me he can't because he wasn't the one who took my order. But to make up for it he offered my underaged friend and I shots to make up for it. Needless to say I won't be returning to RePetes."
Negative	"The food is average Chinese food...neither here nor there. What threw this to a below average rating was the following...I asked if I could substitute my egg roll for 1 crab Rangoon.  She said no. I asked if there was a reason. She said, ""Because they don't want to."" I was like a deer in headlights wondering if I'd just heard that correctly. It was confusing because she says it in the nicest tone with a big smile. Almost made it worse? There is enough competitors in the area willing to accommodate a simple request. I will take my business elsewhere."
Negative	"We booked an appointment with the restaurant manager to book a large group dinner for our daughter's baptism. He was really good on the phone, but when he saw us he was extremely dismissive and distance. What could it be???? I will never go to that restaurant or support their business . 

The dark ages are over and there are many different  people and races in the world and businesses need to be inclusive, we live in Canada damn it!!!!"
Negative	"This is one of those ""check it off the list"" places. Unique atmosphere, yes. Beer was fine. Food was overpriced.

The buffalo chicken pierogies and onion soup were good but the $34 steak and mashed potatoes came out cold and before we were even finished with our soup. The waitress tried to charge us for a drink that I couldn't drink because it didn't come out properly. Not what I'd expect for the prices they were charging."
Negative	This is an upscale restaurant at the Grand Canal shops. The ambience is nice and service was OK ( It was great till the end, when they forgot to give me coffee with the dessert ). I can excuse them probably as it was quite late and they were winding up. Still, it is what it is. If there are 7 people on the table, you should ask each one of them for coffee. I was at a sponsored event. The dinner was 5 course and looked very appealing and so was the presentation, but taste was very bland. One particular thing to note: The asparagus they gave was too thick and one of them was uneatable.
Negative	"I have eaten here before and had the crispy shrimp tacos and loved them but...
This review is for Happy Hour only.

The place is beautiful both inside and out. Free chips and salsa is always nice, the salsa was okay, nothing special.
They have 4 different tacos (chicken, beef, pork, and lamb) to choose from for 2$ each. $5 Blue Agave Margaritas and $2 Modelo beer. The margarita was good, probably a tad on the weak side but I still liked it. I  got a beef and a chicken taco. I love that they make their own tortillas, but thats as far as I can say I loved. They were both very different, but they also had so much going on, with the sauces they use. A friend got the lamb and she is from Mexico and said it was spicy.

The worst part of the night was our service (Rob), unattentive, if you didn't flag him down, he wouldn't even look your way to see if you needed anything. They forgot about my tacos, everyone else had eaten and I was still waiting. At the end we were trying to figure out how much each of us owed, and we asked him how much do they charge for a soda...he looked at us like we just asked him the meaning of life...he ran away. We guesstamated as to not frazzle him anymore. I didn't think it was that busy."
Negative	I ordered a pizza a month ago that took 3 hours to deliver. I was sent a come-back-customer coupon in the mail to get my business back. I ordered another pizza, thinking it was a previous fluke. It has now been an hour and twenty minutes and I have called several times and they keep saying it is on the way. I live less than ten minutes from this restaurant. Seriously, if this store wants to continue business then perhaps they need to fix their delivery system since it is atrocious.
Negative	Went to the Rancho office after being reffered by my general practioner. The doctor looked at my mole for two seconds and made me reschedule for the biopsy, at fifty dollars a copay this simple procedure became an expensive endeavor. When  I called to schedule my next appointment, I was told the doctor had changed offices and I would have to go all the way across town to the Seven Hills location or pay for another evaluation at the Rancho clinic with a different Dr.  When I went to my appointment across town, I had to wait 45 minutes in the lobby for a three minute procedure. Definitely will not be going to LVSCC again!
Negative	This place is kind of depressing.  I have seen it closed more then it is open.  Their Drag shows are amazing though.  It is clean, and drinks are strong and very cheap, no cover, nicely decorated.  But like I said other then the drag shows, I hardly see it open for business.
Negative	"Okay, I understand that sushi bars in Vegas feel a real pressure to offer an all-you-can-eat special to their customers, it's important to remain competitive in this sushi saturated market - but one gets the impression that Kobe really despises this simple fact. 

Sure they're not the only sushi bar that charges more for single serve items (after all they have to make up the difference) - but those customers that do decide to order off the single serve menu expect some sort of value for their dollar.

My fare included one roll, one pair of tuna nigiri and a seafood salad. With a glass of water my bill came to an astonishing $35 plus tax and tip. The roll was the least appetizing of all three, with an over-whelming amount of vinegar doused over the entire roll making the rice fall apart as I picked it up - plus everything tasted like vinegar and I could not taste the fish at all. The nigiri was okay, even though the portion of fish was tiny. The seafood salad was quite good, but when I inevitably compare it to similar offerings at other sushi bars around town, it seemed - well, small.

I was not very hungry, which explains the decision to go piece meal (so to speak), but after the three offerings from Kobe I was left feeling unsatisfied. If I had only paid $10 less and had the all-you-can-eat I would have at least been filled up - but at what cost?"
Negative	"I won't bother with the specifics because pretty much everything was wrong. Every single time I go to this place, the order is wrong and poorly made, that's IF their ""system isn't down."" This is hands down the worst fast food restaurant in the region and I would be ashamed if I were responsible for it."
Negative	"What bunch of scum bags should have read reviews prior to ordering service,
as many customers said in prior posts bait and switch.
Ordered palm tree trimming last week was told $50.00 a palm tree got a call from
Ben a real a hole says I forgot about any conversation or price I gave you last week
and raised the price 50%!!!!!!!
Come on if you work for a tree company and you are the main arborist and you don't  know
The freaking prices that's BS.
Stay as far away from these thieves as possible,very dishonest company,I got them

Negative	Just went to beautiful location for just a tour and it's either the girl didn't want to work today or she didn't think we could afford it. We asked for a tour and she showed us two properties. Didn't care to explain the amenities they had or show us. If it wasn't for our clients telling us what liv had to offer, we wouldn't have known anything nor would we have wanted even purchase anything. Poor sales representation and couldn't care less attitude. Thanks Gabriella !
Negative	"This is not a reflection of the front desk men. They are always helpful and pleasant to work with at the Chandler, AZ location.  

That being said this is one of the worst client / customer service experiences I've had where the customer service call center people do not care about you as a human being. We are already going through a lot of tough times needing this device, we don't need another group of people judging us and making life harder than it needs to be. 

First incident: My flight was cancelled from Michigan to Arizona causing me to not be able to make an appointment. I called Quickstart as soon as I found out from the airline, that I couldn't make my appointment. It was closed of course so I left a message on Monday July 16th 2018 that I couldn'tmake it to my appointment the next day on Tuesday July 17th. My next appointment to make it up, I faced a $25 missed appointment charge for something that was literally out of my control. I tried for 3 hours looking for a new flight so I could make my appointment AND work that day. They said ""theres nothing they could do"" but everyone knows that's always the first lie a company will tell you to make you pay extra fees. I got over it and paid it. No empathy, nothing.

Second incident: From my last appointment the fellas gave me a different device than my usual bc that one had an issue putting in mouth pieces, which was fine. It sounded different and looked older more beat up but it worked. So when my device was due to remind me of my appointment this month, it did it as normal. Then one day randomly it kept saying ""Recall your device needs servicing please call to make an appointment"". I didn't know what that meant, I thought it meant maybe they forgot to schedule my appointment and it's a different device so maybe it says it differently. So I called Monday August 13th and told the lady ""my device is saying recall call to make an appointment, but I thought I had one"". She responded saying I did and gave me Wednesday July 15th, which was not what I had scheduled but I didnt want to argue so I said okay. Wednesday rolls around, I'm rushing to get to work and I try to turn on my device and it said ""permanent lockout"". Call #1 hold for 12 mins-  ""sorry it means you missed a test it's a $35 fee to turn it back on. Oh AND you can't miss your appointment today bc that will be another fee so you need to pay to make it"". WHO SAYS IT LIKE THAT FIRST OF ALL!? Also I have been the most diligent and to the T client when it comes to making sure my device is safe, not missing any tests, making sure it's working well, the whole shebang so I have ZERO clue as to how I ""missed a test"" because I would have had to be dead or deaf/blind to not make a test. So we end the call and now I'm left with finding a way to make it to my appointment without my car and leave my job and how to pay for this situation. I call again when I get to my device so I can get it to turn on. Call #2 hold for 13 mins- I call to give the recall code and get it turned on. I said to the agent that I wanted to make a formal complaint because I didnt think this was right. I even told her it had NOTHING to do with her but I've had a terrible experience so far with the company and didn't know if I needed to make a complaint with her or go to BBB, yelp, facebook or wherever else to get someone to treat me like a person. The agent HUNG UP ON ME. I wasn't yelling, or anything if anything I was slightly crying because this has been so hard on my wellbeing. Never got a call back. I finally make it to my appointment by an act of God and the guys are very helpful yet I am extremely upset bc I couldn't even drive my car there because the agent hung up on me when I needed to get it unlocked to make my appointment. So literally the agent did not care, did not hell, wanted me to miss my appointment and essentially get even more fees. 

What kind of company treats others like this, like trash you can just be thrown away. We are PEOPLE with lives. Rent, cars, Bill's, medical expenses. You don't know all I've been through trying to make right on my mistakes. To have a company treat pyou so poorly is unbelievable. Do not trust this company and don't use them because I genuinely don't want anyone to have to go through this. Thank you for listening."
Negative	"We booked a standard SUV through the south west airlines website and they had the lowest rates.Upon arriving at the airport my mobile was dead and I could not find my confirmation so I went to the counter and asked the front desk person to look up my reservation , she refused to help in spite of providing my drivers license and all the information.

I had to then charge my mobile got the reservation number and went up the counter again, she then tried to upsell and upgrade which I politely refused ,after some time she said she would give me a free upgrade ,but on coming home and checked my reservation details again , I found that I did not get any upgrade I just go the same vehicle i reserved.

I declined all the insurance ,but when I reached home I found that my credit card has been charged much more than the quoted price,I am waiting to get the invoice and file a complaint with the credit card company.

Lesson Learnt : Always check the invoice before leaving the car return center"
