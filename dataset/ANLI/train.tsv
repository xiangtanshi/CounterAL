I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.

Mr. Speaker, for two years the Canadian government has been engaged in secret negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment, an agreement which goes well beyond the provisions of NAFTA in ceding power to multinationals and threatens to diminish even further the rights of nations to direct their own economies, provide safe and decent working conditions and protect the environment for future generations.	The Canadian government governs Canadians.	entailment
This story goes back a number of years to when a company from Nova Scotia, related by the way to the leader of the NDP, the L.E.

And it's the right cause. It's the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.

"This practice of forbidding the use of direct citations from the debates of the House of Commons, euphemistically identified as ""the other place,"" was originally intended to prevent, according to Erskine May, fruitless arguments between members of two distinct bodies who are unable to reply to each other and to guard against recrimination and offensive language in the absence of the other party."	Stupid arguments used to happen in the House of Commons.	entailment
And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	There should be an exam to make sure new teachers are properly qualified to teach	entailment
And after she had spoken, Bertha Spahr also spoke, as well. She's the department chairperson, and, actually, I had her as a science teacher. And she presented information to the board, documents, that she and I believe other members of the science department had researched on, I guess cases that had been set down before on creationism in the public school system or something of that nature, just to show them that, you know, if they were still considering this idea, that they might, I don't know, be met with some litigation or something.

My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.

While I found the country-wide consensus on this issue interesting, I found equally interesting the wide range of diversity within the system, among the universities, colleges, and technical schools scattered across the country - each with its own unique mission and mandate, and each responding to the particular needs of the community within which it is situated - working together to provide a post-secondary system of education that may well be second to none.	This consensus involved multiple States.	entailment
This looks artificial when you're dealing with a fact witness, but these are fact witnesses who are also reporters, and I am straining to try to find a fair way to do this. I believe that to the extent -- and I've said this now several times -- that the reporters' testimony is necessary in order to invoke the residual hearsay exception under Rule 807, that the defendants have to have an opportunity to examine the reporters on the same topics and subjects that I would allow the plaintiffs to question them on during their case-in-chief, nothing more and nothing less.	Should the hearsay exception be invoked, defendants would gain rights equal to the plaintiff. 	entailment
Instead of retreating to his ivory tower and dreaming up plans to limit the powers of Quebec's National Assembly, would the minister not be better advised to have a word with the Minister of Finance so that the next federal-provincial conference focuses on the real problem: getting the money to those who provide the services?	The minister needs to be realistic and forget about limiting powers of the Assembly and focus on the real problem.	entailment
"Well, to my understanding, intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex, that it has to be designed.

But I do know that, in its original context, it was creationism that was being used.

But I think it's about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?	he wanted to improve the status of the state	entailment
Bill C-6 creates three new board levels: a five-member land use planning board in the Gwich'in and Sahtu settlement areas; a Mackenzie Valley land and water board, subject to the creation of additional panels which will have up to 17 members, including a five-member permanent regional panel in each of the settlement areas; and an eleven-member environmental impact review board for the entire Mackenzie Valley.

What I've done is, it says that there's no extraneous unpublished material questioning. That's the clarity that I need.

To allay Mr. Benn's concerns, I think it is not fair game to talk about all the other things that they heard and why they wrote the article the way they did and why they excluded quotes. I sincerely believe that that gets into journalistic integrity, and that's problematic, and it's not my intent to allow that, nor would I allow any questioning on anything personal to the reporters.

No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.

Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that the '76 act, too, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone because of the disruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts.

And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs.	This president is not promoting job growth.	entailment
The budgetary measures include tax relief for interest on all student loans, interest relief for more graduates, extended repayment periods for those who need them, extended interest relief periods for those who remain in financial difficulty and reductions in loan principal for those who still face financial difficulty.	people who face financial difficulty need help	entailment
Whenever we are engaged in a conflict, or whenever we are contemplating a conflict which has the potential that this conflict has, we need to realize that it may well be a situation, no matter what the outcome, in which there are no winners and losers but rather a situation in which everybody loses when we choose war as an alternative to diplomacy.	The speaker prefers diplomacy to war 	entailment
As a final comment, I would also like to know how all of these changes that put greater emphasis on rehabilitation and community reformation, greater emphasis on alternative measures and putting the emphasis on the community services element now to help in the reformation of these young people, will be paid for.	"The speaker uses the word ""emphasis"" less than four times."	entailment
Since the beginning of this parliament, every time they were given the opportunity, the members of the Bloc Quebecois-at least those who sit on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade-have asked the government to be more transparent on this issue, by agreeing to table before parliament not only treaties like the ones dealing with extradition and social security, but all treaties.	Bringing the treaties to the table will increase transparency	entailment
On the hog environmental management strategy, for example, the Canadian government has put $2 million in that program along with $1 million from the industry itself to assist the industry to find ways the nutrients from hog operations in Canada can be best managed in the rural areas.

As this Court explained 100 and some years ago in its Burrows-Giles opinion, such constructions are accorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to say, when consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that consistent construction by Congress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent Clause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first through the 105th Congress.	The court feels the same way about copyright laws as it did 50 years ago.	entailment
The government has decided to make the changes required in two stages, and this part covers only what the government is almost forced to do as a signatory to the 1976 international convention, which was to come into force in 1990, but whose implementation was later postponed to March 31, 1996, at the latest.	this agreement takes effect over many years	entailment
No, but that's the Copyright Clause argument, and it seems to me you're saying, okay, we then apply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows us to make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument. If we don't accept the Copyright Clause retrospectivity argument --	after the Copyright Clause argumen is paplied, it will allow them make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument.	entailment
The federal act, when it applies to Quebec and the other provinces, will affect federally regulated businesses-notably telephone companies, banks, airlines and interprovincial carriers-as well as all interprovincial and international personal data exchanges for business purposes.

No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in today's military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.	We may not be peaceful if we don't rebuild our military	entailment
It was sometime in 2004. It was prior to the June meetings because my husband was a teacher at the school, so I often heard things that he would come home and tell me. So I knew that there was some discussion over the biology book, so sometime before that. I can't tell you exactly when.	Her husband told her about what happened	entailment
Your Honor, just one other clarification question. With regard to asking what they saw and heard with regard to all of the statements and the articles, I would assume that's statements made after the gavel banged and the meeting was over. Some of those quotes are afterwards.	the statements are not clear so need to be asked what they saw and heard	entailment
No, absolutely not. I don't object to Pandas being in the library, just like I don't object to, you know, any of the other books being in the library, as long as -- as long as it's the appropriate level and -- you know, I mean, there is a censorship process that goes into putting books in the library. So, I mean, as long as it has gone through that process and it's approved to be there, I don't have a problem with it being there.	The agent only wants books of the appropriate level in the library.  	entailment
The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.	The cut in benefits could be 32.7%.	entailment
From March 4, 1993, when the damage control operation began, through the orchestrated in-house investigation, through the conceiving, conspiring, conniving and sanctioning of lies and misinformation, through the tampering with documents and the destruction of evidence, to the successful campaign to shut down the Somalia inquiry, people in high places for whom we are ultimately responsible have evaded accountability, escaped responsibility and eluded the efforts of properly constituted civilian authority - Parliament, government, a Royal Commission - to establish the truth.	The investigation was about controlling what negative actions had already happened.	entailment
The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.	They are going to get 120,000 + 5,000 troops 	entailment
I am pleased to respond to the motion by the member for Skeena. The member has asked that the government ignore years of consultation, negotiation and goodwill and extend the uncertainty even longer by sending the Nisga'a final agreement to a procedure heavy referendum in British Columbia.

Yes, but all of the history of the development of these clauses suggests that -- and this Court has indicated in its decisions with respect to copyright, that the Framers were concerned and the Congress is legitimately concerned not just in providing the spark of creativity, but to make sure that that's distributed widely and available, and there may be many reasons why -- we're -- we --	This passage is an incomplete thought.	entailment
If he takes that position he also runs the risk that should at some point in the future his situation change so that he cannot continue to operate without some sort of temporary closure or a long term closure, he has now opened himself up for all kinds of legal liability, lawsuits and persecution in the courts.	Long term closure would make legal liability less likely.	entailment
I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	Tipper contains a t	entailment
I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.	early learning and pre-school are important to them. 	entailment
I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	The IMF deals with helping out countries.	entailment
I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes. I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.	The speaker will encourage the use of tax cuts.	entailment
However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.	A child stands in a classroom because it is overcrowded.	entailment
Well, in numerous ways. First, as a teacher, professionally, I feel that teachers in general are harmed, myself, as well, because there's a dichotomy here in what they're saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as they're not teaching it.	The individual here is speaking from person experience.	entailment
Mr. Speaker, I present to the House a petition signed by many of my constituents who are asking that section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act be repealed so that rural route mail couriers are allowed to have collective bargaining rights in the same manner as private sector workers who deliver mail in rural areas.	The petition was signed numerous times.	entailment
Recently Quebec agricultural producers, processors, and distributors, as well as the UPA and MAPAQ, came up with an initial proposal: with the OECD showing more flexibility, the United States taking a tougher stance, and little give from Asia, Japan and Europe, the UPA is calling for the status quo.	It took team work to come up with an initial proposal	entailment
I did not view and do not view the law as providing that there is some exhaustion requirement, although I understand some cases have said that. In this particular fact situation -- and I do think, I will say, on the issue of precedent, you can distinguish cases of -- and I'm not so sure I would be as fearful as some might be as to precedential value. I think this case is somewhat distinguishable, and I don't know that a judge in another situation would knee-jerk allow this type of testimony. We are in a very unique situation here, and that's what we have.	The person does not agree with the law	entailment
If a bank or an insurance company acts in a fiduciary and responsible manner and must abide by the rules and regulations of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, then surely a crown corporation should be no less concerned about the security of the money it invests.

"""Question: Is there anything else that the board has done here in connection with the curriculum change that provides a basis for your complaint? ""Answer: From what I can see from attending the board meetings, I don't know, because so much of the curriculum debate takes place at non-public meetings that I am not aware of. And when board members are questioned at meetings, they really don't answer any questions. So it gives this whole illusion of secrecy to the process, which, you know, may be a big part of the problem. It may just be a big misunderstanding."""	There is not unanimous agreement on the matter of the curriculum change.	entailment
And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read.

I would hope so. And as far as I know, that is the case, because Dover says that it is a standards-based school, and so I assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material, that they would have to be abiding by the state standards.	Graduates from Dover have aquired the knowledge and learning required by state standards.	entailment
Mr. Speaker, I was pointing out that today, as we are debating the estimates, when we think the most important issue facing parliament is the spending of the public purse, the approving of taxation and the spending of $145 billion of taxpayer money, we would take that very seriously in our debates in the House of Commons.	They are trying to come to an agreement about spending and taxation.	entailment
So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.	We need to focus on forming a more perfect union than we are doing right now. 	entailment
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, September 21, 1999, I shall call the attention of the Senate to the financing of post-secondary education in Canada and particularly that portion of the financing that is borne by students, with a view to developing policies that will address and alleviate the debt load which post-secondary students are being burdened with in Canada.	Canadian students could benefit from the Senate looking at student loans.	entailment
If the federal government in its infinite wisdom-since it always knows more than anyone else about all issues relating to the environment-were to decide that we need to make an additional 5%, 6% or 7% reduction to industrial emissions, to toxic emissions in the atmosphere, under the agreements negotiated at Kyoto, on a uniform basis across Canada, this would be easily complied with by Alberta, where the emissions have increased in recent years.	the speaker is using a sarcastic tone in regards to the government	entailment
The sense is that if we partner together effectively, if we build a relationship with First Nations and ask for their input and advice on taking the recommendations of the royal commission and building a plan of action together, engaging the provinces and the private sector, including Canadians in that process, we will find the solutions we need to ensure that aboriginal people are able to benefit from the wealth and prosperity of Canada.	People from canada are a lot of times called canadians	entailment
Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.	Citizens voted for the representation in congress that banned partial birth abortion.	entailment

I was told that it was impossible to do because even though we had the rolling stock, we did not have the ability to deal with a union that had the opportunity to charge double time, triple time and all kinds of things on a train that was going across the country for two or three days.

I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.

Starting today, the government must follow the example set by one of its own backbenchers, the member for Thunder Bay-Atitokan, who wrote in The Chronicle Journal as recently as March 29 that the government was again going to meet with public service employee representatives on the issue of pension fund surpluses in order to come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties.

Essentially there were a lot of people in the community who were standing and speaking at this meeting because they wanted to warn the school board that they were not in favor of any legal action coming against the community, against the school board.

Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you. If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	Do not think about carrying a gun illegally, as you can get arrested.	entailment
Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	The executive order referenced here won't apply to state and local law enforcement agencies.	entailment
Your Honor, as you know, we've got the question of whether or not these are admissible for effect. Our position on that we've articulated. I don't know if you want us to argue at greater length or brief, but it's hearsay to the extent it's offered for the truth of the matter asserted as effect.	They are speaking to a judge.	entailment
That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view.

For example: to have diplomatic initiatives to diffuse the tensions between ethnic groups and encourage peacekeeping initiatives between these rival groups; to introduce positive information to counter the negative information that is being spread; to have an international arms registry that deals with specific arms, which would go a long way to adding a measure of transparency and accountability where there are military organizations.	Having an international arms registry will  help to  diffuse the tensions between ethnic groups.	entailment
But how can that happen when we know from the start that this agency will be made up of an extremely large number of employees-40,000 is the number we have been seeing-who will no longer come under the Public Service Employment Act and who will therefore have difficulty keeping their union?

I hope that the House will come up with an amendment to clause 9 because as it stands now, if we have final offer selection on top of it, it would amount to telling the arbitrator or the arbitration panel ``Now you are going to manage this whole thing, and look at it as if it were a private company, a totally private firm, and at the same time you will be looking for the best way to settle the dispute''.

Late in '04 my daughter came home from school, and I was discussing kind of what was going on in the district with her.

Mr. Speaker, will the minister admit that he should support the shipbuilding industry in Quebec and Canada by taking the same kind of measures the U.S. government has in place for its industry, so that our builders can at least compete on a level playing field with the Americans?

Well, that's what I'm not going to get into. And I understand and I respect that argument. But I think I've got to line-draw here someplace. And I understood that argument before.

If according to Bloc Quebecois policy only individuals are allowed to contribute to the financing of political parties, how can the Bloc Quebecois justify that, in 1994, candidates for the Bloc Quebecois accepted corporate donations amounting to several thousand dollars in spite of the fact that their internal regulations preclude it?

However, he went on to state that the matter was very serious and if any special circumstances were brought to the attention of the House and the Chair to the effect that members were in some way intimidated in their work or prevented from discharging their duties freely and without hindrance, there would be no hesitation in recognizing the matter as a breach of privilege.

No. What we were saying is, if Congress wants to permit restoration of films, for example, an issue that's been well briefed here, Congress can say, if you restore the film, then the restoration gets a copyright so long as it satisfies originality as outlined in Feist, and it gets a copyright for a period of time.

And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.

I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	The previous waiting period was less than half a week.	entailment
In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.	Saddam Hussein went to Kuwait.	entailment
I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.	Government contracts restrict the options of small businesses.	entailment
That, in the opinion of this House, the government should implement a ``Regulatory Budget'', parallel to the traditional spending budget, which would detail estimates of the total cost of each individual regulation including the government enforcement costs as well as the cost of compliance to individual citizens and businesses; and include a risk/benefit analysis of each regulation, to enable cost/benefit analysis of regulation by parliamentarians.	The number of parliamentarians is not stated in the statement.	entailment
Since the 1996 flood-and I make no apologies for bringing this up again-everyone has become aware of the necessity to preserve the valuable heritage of the few remaining houses surrounding the little white house in the old section of Chicoutimi, known as ``le bassin'', which everyone wants to preserve.	"The 1996 flood caused major damage to the area known as ""le bassin,"" leaving behind only a small white house surrounded by a few other houses."	entailment
Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the House will now proceed to the consideration of a motion to adjourn the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration, namely the effect of a labour dispute on the movement of grain in the port of Vancouver.	The matter is important. 	entailment
Well, I'm aware that that statement was modified several times. In fact, there were different drafts of that statement that I had seen. The exact modification, are you telling me that from the time that they had approved it in October, it was modified before it was read in January? Because it was again read in, I believe, like May, and there was a change from that point in time, unless I'm incorrect and that is the change that I'm thinking of.	There are at least 3 versions of the statement	entailment
It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years. I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.	The speaker is making campaign promises	entailment
I thank the hon. member from the Conservative Party for bringing forward this motion so that at least there is some discussion in the House of Commons about what really is a most fundamental and important aspect of people's daily lives, the right to adequate, safe, affordable shelter and housing in Canada.	The speaker does not think the House of Commons is paying enough attention to the issue of housing in Canada 	entailment
Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	The topic at hand is immigration	entailment
I mean, it's a penny on 1,000, or probably a lot less than that, frankly. So I can not only not imagine a person whose decision to write would be governed by such a thing, I cannot imagine a European who would come to America to copyright his work for such a reason.	Europe is not the same place as America.	entailment
The objective and the thrust of this bill is to prohibit certain financial institutions, including broadcasting and telecommunications undertakings and companies to which the Insurance Companies Act applies, from charging money to their regular clients for the provision or sale of a new service without the expressed consent of the client.	Customers wouldn't have to worry as much about unexpected charges after the bill has passed.	entailment
The memorial stands as a symbol of healing for the Armenian community and will be a lasting tribute to all victims of ethnic hatred, including the Armenian genocide of 1915 at the hands of the Turkish government, the first genocide of the century but not the last as tragically ethnic massacres continue to take place every day.	The Armenian genocide occurred in the year after 1914.	entailment

My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, repeatedly questioned the Minister of Justice, asking her whether she thinks it is right for a major drug dealer like Joseph Lagana, who laundered nearly $47 million, to get paroled after serving only one sixth of his sentence.	The minister got questioned on early release of a criminal so the crime must have been pretty severe.	entailment

"As to who mandates, I do not think I can do any better in answering that question succinctly than to quote the Secretary-General of the United Nations who has appealed to the international community to restore the UN Security Council to what he has called its ""pre-eminent position as the sole source of legitimacy on the use of force."""

I understand those things could come up in the course of the deposition, and I'll rule on those as I can if I'm not instantly available.

You will note, honourable senators, that I am not following the Reform line of putting a lowered debt as a priority, because the economic growth that is so necessary for more jobs is better assured by a drop in taxes and charges against total payrolls, and because the debt-to-GDP ratio will probably drop to 63 per cent within three years.	Reform supporters want the government to stop spending more money than it takes in.	entailment

We were heartened to hear of the government's plan to address the issue of student finance, and to establish the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, an $800-million foundation geared mainly toward funding for university research, especially in health, the environment, science and engineering.	The Canadian Foundation for Innovation will benefit students. 	entailment
Hon. members will know that this official opposition attaches great importance to ensuring that parliament clearly states its intent in any bill that we consider or that we adopt, because if we do not, and the government is often sloppy in this area, we simply hand jurisdiction by default over to the courts, and that has been done far too many times.	The author states in the article that  he believes the goverment is pretty messy upon doing it	entailment
It says, and I agree with my colleague from the New Democratic Party on this, that instead of cutting a total amount of $48 billion between now and the year 2003, cutting $48 billion in higher education, social assistance and health, the government will only be cutting $42 billion.	The speaker is in agreement about the budget with his Democratic colleague.	entailment
When they try to hurt us, they are hurting themselves, because now we can talk about committees, such as the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, the Standing Committee on Finance, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and the Standing Committee on Health.	There are more than 4 committees mentioned.	entailment
"So I'm inclined to accept this language, you know, not word for word, only to the extent where it states, rather generically, ""wherein an affidavit is provided,"" I would take that sentence and simply say that affidavits have been provided, rather than ""wherein.""

Local control or local input into resource management can be a good thing but it should not be based on anything other than the fact that there are people who are local to the area and who have a vested interest in the decisions that may affect them and may affect the land they are living on.	people who have a vested interest in the land are the only ones that should have local control	entailment
Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	The governor and the speaker don't view education in the same way	entailment
That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.

Based on the federal decision announced in the 1995 budget of the Minister of Finance, it was initially anticipated that, by the year 2003, federal transfers to the provinces for health, higher education and social assistance would be subject to cumulative cuts totalling $48 billion.	Funding cuts would be expected to impact schools, among other things 	entailment
I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly -- and they're good. They're very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	This speaker very much wants people to engage in purchasing insurance in the private marketplace	entailment
I would agree. And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.	I don't think all cops are doing a good job	entailment
Could the government explain what ongoing action it is taking, what progress has been made to date and when a final resolution is expected, with respect to the present situation whereby American shipbuilders have open access to the Canadian market, yet Canadian commercial vessels are prohibited for sale in the USA?

As we know, the business world, including the Conseil du patronat du Qubec, the Quebec chamber of commerce and the Quebec and Canadian association of manufacturers et exporters came and told the committee that Quebec should be allowed to manage its education sector, and that opting out with full compensation should be allowed, so that the money could be used based on Quebec's needs and realities.

In the member's interpretation of that clause I would ask him if he understands that to mean just dockside and in close vicinity to the grain handling on that end, or does it really apply to the whole myriad of unions involved in grain handling and rail transport from the prairies?

-- I really think this is an important question and, as Justice O'Connor points out, if we have to ask what's the most plausible explanation for this rule, to reward existing vested interest or to stimulate former new works, it seems to me that it's probably the former.

It had the opportunity and has already done so many times in the Criminal Code with respect to the environment, but it wants to carry this even a little further with standards, objectives and mostly, the need to honour international agreements or international commitments made by Canada.

Millions of Canadian families are going to be sitting around their kitchen tables late at night with their pocket calculators, pencils and their reams of paper trying to understand this byzantine, incomprehensible, opaque tax code we have imposed on them because of the innumerable regulations, exemptions, deductions and credits which have been inspired by motions like the one before us today.

"And at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the words ""perceived, saw, and heard,"" we were concerned, as you well know, with the word ""perceived"" in terms as to what's the thought process.

Well, and then what happened was, we had a conference call, Eric, Pat, several others in Pat's office and myself and Terry. They indicated that they would not.

I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	Increased one-on-one time with teachers is beneficial for students. 	neutral
Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	Bush-Quayle administration showed good judgement. 	neutral
I submit, Justice Souter, that there's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that doesn't work very well because of the economies of other countries, the parade of constraints on artists in other countries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed, it should be 2 more years, or 5 more years later --	Justice Souter has ruled over a case involving castiel	neutral
In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.

Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to the motions in Group No. 6 of Bill C-19.

That's got to mean something, and if it means that we are limited in our ability to agree with the Europeans as they continually expand the term in light of their own vision of what copyright is about, then that's the meaning of a constitutional restriction.

The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. I don't. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.	Middle Class can make near $200,000 a year and still be considered middle class.	neutral
The Government has argued as if petitioners had advanced a general theory of the Copyright Clause, or a general constraint under which Congress must operate. That is a mistake.

Surely the member would admit that we should not prejudge the inquiry and that there were some students or even non-students who were members of groups such as the International Socialist Workers Party and other radical organizations who were clearly there to disrupt the summit, posing a security threat and tearing down a security wall separating them from heads of states.	Socialists are disruptive.	neutral
It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.	This is a presidential debate	neutral
I would. Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	The budget proposed was very small	neutral
The question before federal and provincial finance ministers, when they met on this subject last February, was would they simply continue to let the actuarially unfunded liability increase, or would they finally begin to deal with it, recognizing that the $600 billion would become $700 billion within a few short years.

I agree with that. I agree with that.

There is no question that John Stewart has brought a powerful personal commitment to defining a realistic approach to our unending preoccupation with war and peace in the modern context, which, as he said in one of his early speeches in this house, sometimes tends to tire us out and foster a lack of will to persist in advancing that cause.

Uniformity is not a sine qua non, and this is where Pepin-Robarts in reminding us of the opting in and opting out facilities and raising the compensation in opting out provided the opportunity if there is a spirit of goodwill and of pragmatic compromise for working out arrangements to accommodate the increasing pluralism in our federal society.

In speaking for myself, it would be my humble opinion that if these parties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify, as I just indicated to you, Your Honor, that I think the focus of this trial all of the sudden isn't addressed as to intelligent design, but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in terms as to these stringers, not full-time employees, not employees at all, standing up for what they think is right.	The speaker believes in intelligent design. 	neutral
I have no problem with the people on welfare having an opportunity for a job, but I do not agree with the fact that the government, because of problems due to its changes to employment insurance, takes people and, to get them off welfare because changes to employment insurance have resulted in an increase in the number of people on welfare, and sends them working in order to get them on employment insurance and off the provincial rolls.	Employment of people on welfare always includes employment insurance. 	neutral

History will no doubt properly credit him and his government for their courage and foresight, initiatives such as the free trade agreement with the United States and NAFTA, abolishing the 13.5-per-cent manufacturers sales tax and introducing the 7-per-cent GST consumption tax to spur exports.	He is the president of the USA.	neutral
Let me comment on that. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help.

In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.

I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that. And I'm going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.	The writer is under Jim	neutral
The bill relates specifically to the fact that under the current provisions of the legislation, if a bill arrives in the hands of a member or a candidate following the election, if it was not received within the required time period in which a candidate or his or her official agent may pay the bill, the only process available now to the member to be able to pay that bill is to get a court order allowing that to happen.	The bill wasn't accepted	neutral
What he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform.

It was no accident that the three major urban transit companies in Quebec, namely the Socit de transport de la Communaut urbaine de Montral, Socit de transport de Laval and Socit de transport de la rive sud de Montral, as well as most if not all their unions and employees are asking that we support a progressive and innovative policy.	There are exactly 4 transportation companies in Quebec.	neutral
We have 125 years of history of this Court making sure that the limits, both express and implied, in the Copyright Clause, have some meaning. The Feist opinion very clearly sets out the implied limits, a per se limit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was trying to get me to say.	The Copyright Clause is not being upheld	neutral
They leave all civility, take a cowardly gun and go to the neighbour's farmhouse, whose cousin is married to theirs, then murder the boy who could become a soldier, humiliate and renounce all sense of community, burn the home, steal the livestock, take any money from the victims and send the remaining souls, having lost all, on a foot journey into the unknown.	The boy wanted to become a soldier	neutral
Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws. I think we still need affirmative action. I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position. The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also. But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.	Gore didn't realize there was a hate crime statute	neutral
That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- let's talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	The top 1% oppose paying one-third of all the federal income taxes and in return, get one-fifth of the benefits.	neutral
It states that we should not negotiate any further liberalization of trade or investment at the Seattle meeting of the WTO or the free trade area of the Americas without first securing enforceable international rules on core labour standards, environmental protection, cultural diversity, the preservation of public health care and public education.	there should be enforcible rules for some aspects of health care and public education but not other aspects	neutral
My colleague from West Nova indicated that very thing, that we could accept some of the proposed changes, good changes which the Liberals have put forward but that we could not accept them based on the facts, figures and numbers we have at this time with respect to the taxation rates which will be attached to this bill.	I [the speaker] am from West Nova.	neutral
I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.	God is believed by bart	neutral
I wonder how he expects us to put forward a strong position on these issues if we are not part of the World Trade Organization or if we were not in a position, with meetings like Seattle, where we can pull together different countries from around the world that have a similar position to ours.	the sky had no clouds.	neutral
Yes. Two of them, my oldest is at the high school, the Dover High School, and then I have -- the next one is at the Weiglestown Elementary School. And my son is hearing-impaired, so he is charged with the education of Dover School District, meaning that they have to provide his education, but he actually attends classes at a hearing-impaired classroom.	Both schools  can accommodate for special needs students. 	neutral
Once again I will admonish all members that if they are going to stretch the credibility of their argument on Bill C-4 by referring to other issues, which is certainly their privilege, it would be best to use some imagination and to be sure to continue to come to a touchstone and not to challenge the Chair by forcing the Chair to make a ruling.	The Chair is the person this speech is coming from	neutral
A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't. And so I think this is an issue. I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	people from washington have lots on initials	neutral
In the last four years, the federal government has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces by closing military bases, reducing unemployment insurance benefits, slashing budgets for regional development, and reducing tax transfers for health, welfare and education.	Quebec and the Atlantic provinces have become partners	neutral
And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that. We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.	Results may or may not be received this way.	neutral
In recent months we have witnessed one of the most disturbing human tragedies since the second world war: ethnic cleansing, deportation and dispossession of close to one million Kosovars, who have been deprived on both a number of civil rights and their right to self-government by the Milosevic regime for some ten years now.	Milosevic has gone into retirement.	neutral
The first is to give the people of Canada more democratic control over representation in the upper house by electing those representatives, and to ensure that senators, whoever they are and whatever they are and whatever they do, are servants of the people of Canada, not servants of the party of the prime minister who appointed them.	Democratic control never happened. 	neutral
To the people of the south shore, the volunteers, the volunteer fire-fighters, ground search and rescue, Coast Guard, emergency health services, soldiers, sailors, aircrew, RCMP and the Halifax fire and police services, I extend not only my own personal gratitude but also the gratitude of all Nova Scotians.	All the helpers did not want to help	neutral
Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.	gun laws are enforced too heavily	neutral
By the way, they are going to build this fund and they are going to have some Liberal hacks running it unaccountable because there are clauses in here which, if they do not get changed, will make sure that the investment board of the Canada pension plan is not accountable to Parliament.	this person reports directly to parliament	neutral
(2) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection (1) shall, as soon as practicable, undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and, shall within five yeas after the review is undertaken, submit a report to the House of Commons.''	The House of Commons had not been created as of 1799.	neutral
I agree with that, and I did support that law. But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.	The speaker is John Kerry.	neutral
That's not smart. I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	The president shut down the loophole in a nanosecond	neutral
The Harper as well as Graham set out very clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public domain. Those limits make no sense under the reasoning the Government has offered. The Government's reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong.	The Government is right.	neutral
Now, I don't have time to preside over a deposition at this late date. And I know that you respect that. You're experienced counsel and you know that. I do know from my private practice experience that I was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in mid-deposition. That could be one of the most unhappy experiences that a lawyer would have.	The granddaughter has never been to boston	neutral
And I've done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. I've reached across the aisle. I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	The other colleagues worked with John McCain.	neutral
In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.

"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.

Instead, I am raising this question of privilege on the grounds that this attack on Ms Copps is clearly a means to obstruct a member of Parliament of either house in the discharge of their duties, whether the duties are met in the other place or whether the duties are met in this place.	Ms Copps is attempting to obstruct the Prime Minister.	neutral
Biotechnology, in Montreal essentially, was established with the assistance, the indefeasible support of the Canadian government and of my colleague in industry, especially through the creation of the biotechnology research institute, which gave a lift to biotechnology in Montreal.	Biotechnology is a large industry in the United States.	neutral
It's certainly the case that we are asserting, in light of the changed circumstances, that the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is a fundamental First Amendment interest, and that the First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of this case, is that the public domain be permitted as a source for cultivating work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction.	First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of this case is our goal	neutral
But I thought you were saying that if you accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its important interest and important objective when you get to the First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis.	The First Amendment doesn't have anything to do with copyright clause.	neutral
Mr. Speaker, to answer the member's first point about lower unemployment, the Minister of Finance in budget plan 1999 on page 64 projects that employment insurance benefit payments will rise from $11.8 billion to $13.8 billion by 2000-01, an extra $2 billion for employment insurance payments.	Mr. Speaker needs a hug.	neutral
But it is hard to understand how, if the overall purpose of the Copyright Clause is to encourage creative work, how some retroactive extension could possibly do that. I -- one wonders what was in the principle 13 difficult principle given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that would ever kick in?	the Copyright Clause is only valid in canada	neutral
He came to care about the Senate, but he has deep concerns about its viability in its present form, concerns which he expressed in a very fine speech in February of 1998. He challenged all of us to work together constructively for change, both constitutional change and internal change.	Internal change is welcomed by everyone.	neutral
By our order of last Thursday -- the date escapes me, I think it was Thursday -- the Court denied relief in that matter. The Court was advised that yesterday, on September the 27th, the reporters, both of them, showed up at the appointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the defendants, and I'm advised -- and I'll correct this if I'm wrong -- that both reporters cited the reporter's privilege that they consider to exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer any questions at those depositions.	The time of this statement is the 20th century	neutral
I can confirm that the Canada-Japan relationship, as well as the multilateral relationship that organization has with Asia-Pacific countries, has served Canada well in encouraging other countries to follow the Canadian example of signing the convention banning anti-personnel mines, which took place in December of last year.	Canada-Japan relationship has weakened relations with Brazil.	neutral
I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have.	Violent entertainment is usually aimed at children	neutral
And I recall the meeting starting with Bill Buckingham sort of -- I'm sorry, Trudy Peterman spoke about her -- actually, hold on. Give me one second to think about this. Yes, Trudy Peterman spoke. She was the high school principal at the time. And I know that she spoke because the thing that she said seemed very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously.	Trudy Peterman worked with Bill Buckingham.	neutral
These two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings in terms of different municipalities and school districts. And ironically -- in a sense, I have to commend both Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Bernard-Bubb because, again, they're paid per story. They get anywhere between $40 and $50 a story. They might make $300, $400 a week if they write X number of stories, and that's it. And the stories that they write predominantly are municipal stories.	Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Bernard-Bubb go to the same municipal meetings.	neutral
That is, that the Copyright Clause justifies the extension for works not yet created, but it would be enormously inequitable to have other authors who put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so the Necessary and Proper Clause now allows you to do the 24 retrospective?	The copyright clause protects all authors.	neutral
And we will return next Tuesday night, October 17th, from Washington University in St. Louis for the third and final debate. Thank you, Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. See you next week. For now, from Winston-Salem, I'm Jim Lehrer, thank you and good night.	The third and final debate between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush is scheduled for October 17th, which is 7 days from the current event.	neutral
It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.	You should be friends with every person.	neutral
Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	Background checks at gun shows are not viable	neutral
Well, I understand, and Africa is important. And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. That's an important continent.	Promoting democracy in Africa will be easy.	neutral
We have a copyright term that's consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs. We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation.	Copyright terms are considered null and void if it is found that the creator never filed to include their heirs.	neutral
Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998, and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting works.	Congress extended the terms of Federal copyright in a private copyright bill in 2003	neutral
Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.

What I was really making reference to was when a physician perhaps in Quebec or a physician in the maritimes or a physician out west may make an advance or a discovery in terms of service delivery, there is no system in place right now throughout the country where there is an exchange of this type of information.	No one knows what the speaker was talking about.	neutral
I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	There were inspectors in Iraq.	neutral
I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	The Middle East is currently not at peace.	neutral
That's fine. And I note that, and that's why I wanted to do this on the record. And I understand that you object to that, and I understand the defendants have interposed not only this objection but they have also argued against that. And to the extent that this really clarifies and reasserts what I have in my prior orders, I think you've preserved your position as it relates to that, and I understand that position.	Staying off the record is not a hard decision to make.	neutral
In part that can explain the reason why, although we have implemented free trade agreements, they have not been as good as they can become because the Government of Canada has actually impeded and impaired the ability of the Canadian private sector to be competitive with its counterpart south of the border because it has not done much with removing the interprovincial trade barriers that hamstring them so badly.	No free trade agreements with Canada were signed within the last decade.	neutral
Whereas the Government of Canada seeks to achieve sustainable development that is based on an ecologically efficient use of natural, social and economic resources and acknowledges the need to integrate environmental, economic and social factors in the making of all decisions by government and private entities;	The citizens of canada do not want sustainable resources developed	neutral
As a result of that, Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that, in a certain sense, everybody gets what they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the end of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more than I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there's a reporter's privilege here.	Statement is from a movie character.	neutral
In the face of the referendums that have taken place, private citizens' referendums in British Columbia, not only in Smithers, but in Ladner, Vancouver, and Prince George, all of the surveys that have been done, why is he prepared to ignore the expressed wishes of British Columbians and ram this Nisga'a treaty through the House of Commons without giving the people of British Columbia a chance to vote on it in a referendum?	British columbians are red	neutral
But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you.	Russia listens to America.	neutral

Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own.

George Bush is the president	neutral
To my students taking a PSSA test, well, you know, I -- being an educator, I'm not in love with PSSA tests or standardized tests. But if you're asking me if I object to my daughter taking a standardized test with that information on it, of course not. I would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests.	The speaker provides examples of when standardized tests are not to be desired.	neutral
It is my view that it is a contempt of parliament to have the introduction of a bill so late, knowing full well the timetable in terms of the previous tobacco legislation, Bill C-71, and the time it takes for this parliament to pass Bill C-42, putting it through all the proper stages.	It has taken a long time for parliament to pass Bill C-42	neutral
If I were a married person and had a child, I would want that child to have the faith that I believe, the faith that I cherish, the faith that I believe has made me a better person, a better citizen of Canada, a better member of my community and which, hopefully, some day would make me a star citizen in the eternity of heaven.	Married people with children should have the same faith in order to become better people. 	neutral
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis on his speech and I would like to ask him, following on the questions from my colleague from Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, whether according to his information, he can confirm the rumours about the costs of this new firearm registration program, forecast to be in the order of $80 million, now having risen to $350 million.	The speech was written in 1835	neutral
I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.	This is about a PC war strategy game.	neutral
Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season.	The country is better than it was before 9/11.	neutral
That is speaking about as directly as I can to Motions Nos. 9 and 10. By tabling regulations in parliament and having the House of Commons or a committee subsequently pass them, we want to make sure an effective check is placed on ministers or departmental officials in terms of a bill to arbitrarily implement changes in the legislation.	The bill was rejected by parliment.	neutral

Well, I think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these affect whether the judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an individual author, or an individual creator. What the Framers of the Constitution were concerned about is a gross judgment with respect to what might generally provide incentives to the population --	congress doesn't really care about this issue	neutral
Senator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.	The factors that influence economic security have significantly changed since the last debate.	neutral
I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me. I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people. I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't. I'm not sure where he's coming from. But I will be a tolerant person.

But we have several issues. One is that when we filed our motion to quash last week, quite honestly, we thought we did it in a timely fashion because we filed it only after we were served with the subpoena. Your Honor summarily dismissed that motion to quash, so, in effect, if my reporters were to be called upon to testify today by the plaintiffs, they're undressed.	The reporters are will testify on behalf of the defendant	neutral
Based on this fundamental assessment, which provides reasonable confidence that those advocating the retention of their rights and privileges will find satisfaction under the new school system being implemented, and conscious of the overwhelming support for the school system itself, I will support the resolution with the hope that the debate surrounding it in this place will continue and that my confidence is not misplaced.	Their confidence was misplaced	neutral

In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic are, the World Bank President Wilfinson said recently, Governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been.

The US government is ready to answer all questions about what the United State's obligations are, with confidence.	neutral
I too am very pleased to hear about the Bloc Quebecois' respect for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly when, on September 29, 1994, the Deputy Premier of Quebec made a statement concerning a government employee to the effect that ``A diplomat representing Quebec abroad who is unable to present the aspect of Quebec reality that is our path toward sovereignty is not qualified for his job''.

While the Liberal government advocates hundreds of millions of dollars for gun registry, the Canadian police information system that will house the data from this piece of legislation, the important tool police officers use for information purposes, is coming apart at the seams and is in need of a drastic influx of federal money, $200 million by some conservative estimates, to make it operational.

And if you're otherwise taking the deposition and we're at trial, I'll tell you that we'll construct some mechanism -- and we kind of talked about this a little bit yesterday -- where you hold the thought if counsel instructs the reporters not to answer because it's a problematic question, and we can circle back and we'll deal with that later.	I'll tell you that we'll construct some mechanism -- and we kind of talked about this a little bit the day before yesterday 	contradiction
But Washington is a tough town. And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	Senators pay lobbyists enormous amounts of money to taut their way.	contradiction

Meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and I agree, I have no problem in them being at a deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that.

Exactly 40 people are observing the trial	contradiction
Why -- I mean, I think you have a point on this equity principle. I wonder, is there any review there?

Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.	health insurance has a xxx	contradiction

The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.

Could we then go back to Justice O'Connor's question? To make that very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in principle, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author plus 50 years. Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70. If the latter is unconstitutional on your theory, how could the former not be? And if the former is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous.	Congress extended the term in the year nineteen hundred seventy one.	contradiction
And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches. We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.

I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know it's been going on a long time.

There is something illogical about this, and members will understand that, when one sees the Department of Justice spending the $193 million it will be getting via supply, why the Bloc Quebecois cannot agree with this, given that these monies are mismanaged and misspent by a minister concerned only with raising her profile and getting easy votes in the west.

That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.

Yes, and what -- but the definition of the term was a responsibility vested in Congress, because it has the power -- the legislative history of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on here and suggests why the Framers gave this authority to Congress. There were numerous hearings, there were testimony by the folks that represent the same position as petitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it should be that this done.

But I think marriage is a sacred institution. I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.
