Halak stopped 27 of 30 shots in Monday's 4-2 loss to the Maple Leafs. The 33-year-old gave the Bruins a chance to come back from a one-goal deficit, turning aside all 12 shots he faced in the third period before Toronto added an empty-netter late, but Halak still got saddled with his third regulation loss of the season. He's in an even timeshare with Tuukka Rask right now, and Halak's .928 save percentage in November should keep him firmly in the picture for starts.

A good night's sleep becomes more elusive with age, but what older people label as insomnia may actually be an evolutionary survival trait that helped keep their ancestors alive. A study of modern hunter-gatherers in Africa found that when family members of all different ages live together, the differences in their sleeping patterns ensures that at least one person is awake, or sleeping very lightly, at all times. The research suggests that mismatched sleep schedules and restless nights may be an evolutionary leftover from a time thousands of years ago when a lion might be on the prowl at 2am.

Mexico's new president, Felipe Calderon, seems to be doing all the right things in cracking down on Mexico's drug traffickers. He's appointed new people to key military and criminal justice positions, deployed troops to quell drug violence, reasserted federal police power, extradited a few major traffickers to the United States, and given a green light to legislation clarifying Mexico's drug laws. But all this provides little reason to hope that Mexico has really turned a corner in its efforts to control the illegal drug trade. For a guide to what's in store, one need only look at past sexenios (the six year terms of Mexican presidents).
