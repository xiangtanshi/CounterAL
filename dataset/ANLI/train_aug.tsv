While I found the country-wide consensus on this issue interesting, I found equally interesting the wide range of diversity within the system, among the universities, colleges, and technical schools scattered across the country - each with its own unique mission and mandate, and each responding to the particular needs of the community within which it is situated - working together to provide a post-secondary system of education that may well be second to none.	countrywide consensus is interesting	entailment
This looks artificial when you're dealing with a fact witness, but these are fact witnesses who are also reporters, and I am straining to try to find a fair way to do this. I believe that to the extent -- and I've said this now several times -- that the reporters' testimony is necessary in order to invoke the residual hearsay exception under Rule 807, that the defendants have to have an opportunity to examine the reporters on the same topics and subjects that I would allow the plaintiffs to question them on during their case-in-chief, nothing more and nothing less.	With respect to reporter testimony to get a hearsay exception, defendants are allowed to ask the same types of questions as plaintiffs. 	entailment

"Well, to my understanding, intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex, that it has to be designed.

But I think it's about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?

What I've done is, it says that there's no extraneous unpublished material questioning. That's the clarity that I need.

To allay Mr. Benn's concerns, I think it is not fair game to talk about all the other things that they heard and why they wrote the article the way they did and why they excluded quotes.

So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.

My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm, repeatedly questioned the Minister of Justice, asking her whether she thinks it is right for a major drug dealer like Joseph Lagana, who laundered nearly $47 million, to get paroled after serving only one sixth of his sentence.

You will note, honourable senators, that I am not following the Reform line of putting a lowered debt as a priority, because the economic growth that is so necessary for more jobs is better assured by a drop in taxes and charges against total payrolls, and because the debt-to-GDP ratio will probably drop to 63 per cent within three years.	the economic growth is very necessary	entailment

Hon. members will know that this official opposition attaches great importance to ensuring that parliament clearly states its intent in any bill that we consider or that we adopt, because if we do not, and the government is often sloppy in this area, we simply hand jurisdiction by default over to the courts, and that has been done far too many times.

It says, and I agree with my colleague from the New Democratic Party on this, that instead of cutting a total amount of $48 billion between now and the year 2003, cutting $48 billion in higher education, social assistance and health, the government will only be cutting $42 billion.

Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.

I submit, Justice Souter, that there's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that doesn't work very well because of the economies of other countries, the parade of constraints on artists in other countries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed, it should be 2 more years, or 5 more years later --	3 years may be enough to work, given economies of other countries.	neutral
In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.

It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.

I would. Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.

The question before federal and provincial finance ministers, when they met on this subject last February, was would they simply continue to let the actuarially unfunded liability increase, or would they finally begin to deal with it, recognizing that the $600 billion would become $700 billion within a few short years.

There is no question that John Stewart has brought a powerful personal commitment to defining a realistic approach to our unending preoccupation with war and peace in the modern context, which, as he said in one of his early speeches in this house, sometimes tends to tire us out and foster a lack of will to persist in advancing that cause.

In speaking for myself, it would be my humble opinion that if these parties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify, as I just indicated to you, Your Honor, that I think the focus of this trial all of the sudden isn't addressed as to intelligent design, but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in terms as to these stringers, not full-time employees, not employees at all, standing up for what they think is right.

I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that. And I'm going to try to do better.

What he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform.

And my son is hearing-impaired, so he is charged with the education of Dover School District, meaning that they have to provide his education, but he actually attends classes at a hearing-impaired classroom.	The son gets picked on at school. 	neutral
Once again I will admonish all members that if they are going to stretch the credibility of their argument on Bill C-4 by referring to other issues, which is certainly their privilege, it would be best to use some imagination and to be sure to continue to come to a touchstone and not to challenge the Chair by forcing the Chair to make a ruling.	Bill-C should be the topic of conversation	neutral
A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it? Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't. And so I think this is an issue. I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	 McCain-Feingold is named after two men	neutral
In the last four years, the federal government has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces by closing military bases, reducing unemployment insurance benefits, slashing budgets for regional development, and reducing tax transfers for health, welfare and education.	It is in the best interest of Americans that military bases overseas are closed.	neutral
And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that. We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.	Detroit is definitely ready and able to face up to this challenge. Detroit is one city that is actually taking action. Detroit is a city which has experienced great economic hardship but is still standing up and fighting. Detroit is a wonderful city.	neutral
In recent months we have witnessed one of the most disturbing human tragedies since the second world war: ethnic cleansing, deportation and dispossession of close to one million Kosovars, who have been deprived on both a number of civil rights and their right to self-government by the Milosevic regime for some ten years now.	Serbians are ethnically cleansing Kosovars	neutral
The first is to give the people of Canada more democratic control over representation in the upper house by electing those representatives, and to ensure that senators, whoever they are and whatever they are and whatever they do, are servants of the people of Canada, not servants of the party of the prime minister who appointed them.	representatives should always get there way	neutral
To the people of the south shore, the volunteers, the volunteer fire-fighters, ground search and rescue, Coast Guard, emergency health services, soldiers, sailors, aircrew, RCMP and the Halifax fire and police services, I extend not only my own personal gratitude but also the gratitude of all Nova Scotians.	EMS workers are hard working and very helpful	neutral
Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.

I agree with that, and I did support that law. But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.	One of the people mentioned in this text shot somebody in a hunting accident.	neutral
That's not smart. I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	American workers have one of them named arnold	neutral
The Harper as well as Graham set out very clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public domain. Those limits make no sense under the reasoning the Government has offered. The Government's reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong.	The government's opinion paid no heed to previous opinions.	neutral
Now, I don't have time to preside over a deposition at this late date. And I know that you respect that. You're experienced counsel and you know that. I do know from my private practice experience that I was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in mid-deposition. That could be one of the most unhappy experiences that a lawyer would have.	The lawyer that is speaking owns his own law firm currently.	neutral
And I've done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues. I've reached across the aisle. I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	This person is a Democrat.	neutral
In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.

"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.

Instead, I am raising this question of privilege on the grounds that this attack on Ms Copps is clearly a means to obstruct a member of Parliament of either house in the discharge of their duties, whether the duties are met in the other place or whether the duties are met in this place.

Biotechnology, in Montreal essentially, was established with the assistance, the indefeasible support of the Canadian government and of my colleague in industry, especially through the creation of the biotechnology research institute, which gave a lift to biotechnology in Montreal.

It's certainly the case that we are asserting, in light of the changed circumstances, that the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is a fundamental First Amendment interest, and that the First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of this case, is that the public domain be permitted as a source for cultivating work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction.	First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of this case we must agree	neutral
But I thought you were saying that if you accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its important interest and important objective when you get to the First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis.

Mr. Speaker, to answer the member's first point about lower unemployment, the Minister of Finance in budget plan 1999 on page 64 projects that employment insurance benefit payments will rise from $11.8 billion to $13.8 billion by 2000-01, an extra $2 billion for employment insurance payments.	The benefit payments for employment insurance were $8 billion in 1997.	neutral
But it is hard to understand how, if the overall purpose of the Copyright Clause is to encourage creative work, how some retroactive extension could possibly do that. I -- one wonders what was in the principle 13 difficult principle given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that would ever kick in?	The Copyright Clause is related to santa	neutral
He came to care about the Senate, but he has deep concerns about its viability in its present form, concerns which he expressed in a very fine speech in February of 1998. He challenged all of us to work together constructively for change, both constitutional change and internal change.	He has made that speech before.	neutral
By our order of last Thursday -- the date escapes me, I think it was Thursday -- the Court denied relief in that matter. The Court was advised that yesterday, on September the 27th, the reporters, both of them, showed up at the appointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the defendants, and I'm advised -- and I'll correct this if I'm wrong -- that both reporters cited the reporter's privilege that they consider to exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer any questions at those depositions.	The reporters were later forced to answer questions.	neutral
I can confirm that the Canada-Japan relationship, as well as the multilateral relationship that organization has with Asia-Pacific countries, has served Canada well in encouraging other countries to follow the Canadian example of signing the convention banning anti-personnel mines, which took place in December of last year.	Not all countries will sign the convention.	neutral
I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture.

And I recall the meeting starting with Bill Buckingham sort of -- I'm sorry, Trudy Peterman spoke about her -- actually, hold on. Give me one second to think about this. Yes, Trudy Peterman spoke. She was the high school principal at the time. And I know that she spoke because the thing that she said seemed very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously.	Trudy Peterman had the highest administrative position at the high school at the time.	neutral
These two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings in terms of different municipalities and school districts. And ironically -- in a sense, I have to commend both Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Bernard-Bubb because, again, they're paid per story. They get anywhere between $40 and $50 a story. They might make $300, $400 a week if they write X number of stories, and that's it. And the stories that they write predominantly are municipal stories.	Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Bernard-Bubb work for rival newspapers.	neutral
That is, that the Copyright Clause justifies the extension for works not yet created, but it would be enormously inequitable to have other authors who put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so the Necessary and Proper Clause now allows you to do the 24 retrospective?	Authors need the copyright clause.	neutral
And we will return next Tuesday night, October 17th, from Washington University in St. Louis for the third and final debate. Thank you, Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. See you next week.

It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.	diplomacy is simple and can be done effectively by a novice	neutral
Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.

Well, I understand, and Africa is important.

That's an important continent.	nigeria is important country	neutral
We have a copyright term that's consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs. We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation.	Work created prior to 1790 will have it's copyright dissolved as there will no longer be limits on work that old.	neutral
Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998, and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting works.

I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	Once the coalition has been rebuilt, it will be easier to keep pressure on him.	neutral
I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.

That's fine. And I note that, and that's why I wanted to do this on the record. And I understand that you object to that, and I understand the defendants have interposed not only this objection but they have also argued against that. And to the extent that this really clarifies and reasserts what I have in my prior orders, I think you've preserved your position as it relates to that, and I understand that position.	The plaintiff objects to the judge's comments being on record.  	neutral
In part that can explain the reason why, although we have implemented free trade agreements, they have not been as good as they can become because the Government of Canada has actually impeded and impaired the ability of the Canadian private sector to be competitive with its counterpart south of the border because it has not done much with removing the interprovincial trade barriers that hamstring them so badly.	Canada has implemented at least four free trade agreements.	neutral

As a result of that, Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that, in a certain sense, everybody gets what they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the end of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more than I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there's a reporter's privilege here.	reporter's privilege is important to him.	neutral
In the face of the referendums that have taken place, private citizens' referendums in British Columbia, not only in Smithers, but in Ladner, Vancouver, and Prince George, all of the surveys that have been done, why is he prepared to ignore the expressed wishes of British Columbians and ram this Nisga'a treaty through the House of Commons without giving the people of British Columbia a chance to vote on it in a referendum?	the wishes of british columbians is that the surveys are done incompletely.	neutral
But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make. So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you.

It is my view that it is a contempt of parliament to have the introduction of a bill so late, knowing full well the timetable in terms of the previous tobacco legislation, Bill C-71, and the time it takes for this parliament to pass Bill C-42, putting it through all the proper stages.

Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II.

That is speaking about as directly as I can to Motions Nos. 9 and 10.

Senator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year.

But we have several issues. One is that when we filed our motion to quash last week, quite honestly, we thought we did it in a timely fashion because we filed it only after we were served with the subpoena.

Based on this fundamental assessment, which provides reasonable confidence that those advocating the retention of their rights and privileges will find satisfaction under the new school system being implemented, and conscious of the overwhelming support for the school system itself, I will support the resolution with the hope that the debate surrounding it in this place will continue and that my confidence is not misplaced.

While the Liberal government advocates hundreds of millions of dollars for gun registry, the Canadian police information system that will house the data from this piece of legislation, the important tool police officers use for information purposes, is coming apart at the seams and is in need of a drastic influx of federal money, $200 million by some conservative estimates, to make it operational.

But Washington is a tough town. And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.

Meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and I agree, I have no problem in them being at a deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that.

In addition, Barrie Callahan had stood to request the tapes at that meeting, as well.	Only Barrie Callahan requested the tapes at that meeting	contradiction
And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government.
