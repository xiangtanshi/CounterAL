And we have a fundamental choice to make.

I would like to take this opportunity to say that while we have been fortunate enough not to be involved in a major war for many, many years now and in fact for some decades, we do not forget the fact that many of those serving in our armed forces are serving in very troubled hot spots around the world.	We have not been involved in a war for at least 10 years.	entailment
Mr. Speaker, on Friday, in reply to a question, the Minister of Canadian Heritage said in this House that the Americans had made a written commitment not to react to her subsidy program for Canadian publishers who, as we know, are the big losers in the agreement reached regarding Bill C-55.

Mr. Speaker, what the member has failed to point out is that the number of jobs in Canada has jumped by 1.2 million since October 1993 because of a healthy economy, because we have put our fiscal house back in order, because we now have active measures to help workers back into the job market, because of 30,000 such jobs, and because of the transitional jobs fund in regions where unemployment was too high.

We are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of authenticating the contents of that article, nothing more, nothing less, because I really believe that to do more than that is to create, I think, a precedent which would have reporters called -- Mr. Benn, I think, fears that even this would do that. I don't share that fear. But to go any further than that would mean that a reporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something like this comes up. I strain mightily not to have to do that. That's what I'm talking about. Now, I don't know if that clarifies it.	Mr Benn is worried	entailment
"This practice of forbidding the use of direct citations from the debates of the House of Commons, euphemistically identified as ""the other place,"" was originally intended to prevent, according to Erskine May, fruitless arguments between members of two distinct bodies who are unable to reply to each other and to guard against recrimination and offensive language in the absence of the other party."

Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move a motion to refer the matter of the minister's actions to the committee, if you find that there is a prima facie case, and there is no mandate from this House and no one has the right to represent that they may act for members of this House without specific authority from this House.	The House follows particular rules of order.	entailment
I hope the minister will not forget that, if there ever was a government on this earth that has worked, that has recognized aboriginal governments, and that has paid tribute to, made things easier for and given space to aboriginal communities, to the first nations, because they are nations, it is the Government of Quebec that did it, as early as 1985.

Well, there was -- at this point in time it was the change in the curriculum that was being proposed and voted on that evening. And, again, this was a heated meeting.

But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination. One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.

No. That's too amorphous a question. The issue here, I'll restate, is the veracity of the articles themselves, did the reporter hear the statement as reported. If it was taken out of context, we're not going to delve into that in this examination. The individual who believes -- who was quoted and believes the statement was taken out of context or flatly that he didn't or she didn't say it and it's inaccurate will have the opportunity to say that during the defendants case-in-chief or at any other time during the trial.	The question is hard to answer	entailment

I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.

Mr. Speaker, I was pointing out that today, as we are debating the estimates, when we think the most important issue facing parliament is the spending of the public purse, the approving of taxation and the spending of $145 billion of taxpayer money, we would take that very seriously in our debates in the House of Commons.

That's not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.

I am proud to say that in this party when Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, laid down what he thought would be five conditions that might bring the parties back to the table, this party urged the government to respect the historic position of Canada as a peacemaker, as a peace invoker and as a diplomat in the world.

If we were to take the costs of colour cable TV, free condoms, free bleach for needles, the right to sue and legal costs involved, the right to vote and the administrative and logistical costs involved, gun registration and the cost of patronage appointees the Liberals have put on the parole board, just those costs alone, would we not be able to spend more money on hiring more officers or more judges without the increased raises to get rid of the backlog in the courts?

The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.

I would like to ask my hon. colleague if he sees any relationship between the justices, their influence by the law schools, by the lawyers of the community of which they are a part and if this is part of the reason that these justices are being given these pay raises that perhaps other frontline bureaucrats and government workers are not entitled to.

Finally we heard the Reform leader offer up his astounding statement about how in his view one had to recognize that there was, I guess, a pretty even balance between the international consensus that exists around the globe today among highly respected scientists, among independent peer review scientific evidence and the so-called scientific evidence that is offered up by the high paid lobbyists on behalf of the narrowest of economic interests.

But I thought you were saying that if you accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its important interest and important objective when you get to the First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis.

We have a copyright term that's consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs. We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation.	Copyright terms are considered null and void if it is found that the creator never filed to include their heirs.	neutral
I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.

As a result of that, Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that, in a certain sense, everybody gets what they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the end of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more than I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that there's a reporter's privilege here.

Well, I think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these affect whether the judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an individual author, or an individual creator.

That, I take it, is a harm. Their works have already been created. Harm number 2.

As for us, we are more and more convinced that we need to have our own country by the year 2000, to get out of the mess that the Prime Minister is creating once again, because setting up new programs will generate new deficits, unless the Prime Minister simply intends to once again force taxpayers to make huge efforts to promote his party's visibility and his own.

Well, I think that it could very well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the Congress specifically was aware of -- that there were State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the Federal statute.

Could we then go back to Justice O'Connor's question? To make that very specific, if we agree with you, does that mean that we would, in principle, have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional? I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author plus 50 years. Now they're extending it life of the author plus 70.

In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.

Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.
